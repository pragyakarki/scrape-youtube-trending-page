            "description": "Peter Jackson presents a groundbreaking journey back to Middle-earth through the eyes of legendary director Kenji Kamiyama.\n#LOTR The War of the Rohirrim - only in theaters Christmas.\n\nNew Line Cinema’s original anime feature “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” returns audiences to the epic world brought to life in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, based on the revered books by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nUnder the direction of award-winning filmmaker Kenji Kamiyama (the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” and “Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex” TV series), the talented voice cast is led by Brian Cox (“Succession”) as Helm Hammerhand, the mighty King of Rohan; Gaia Wise (“A Walk in the Woods”) as his daughter Héra; and Luke Pasqualino (“Snowpiercer”) as Wulf. Miranda Otto, who delivered an unforgettable, award-winning performance in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, reprises her role as Éowyn, Shieldmaiden of Rohan, who serves as the tale’s narrator. The voice ensemble also includes Lorraine Ashbourne (Netflix’s “Bridgerton”), Yazdan Qafouri (“I Came By”), Benjamin Wainwright (“World on Fire”), Laurence Ubong Williams (“Gateway”), Shaun Dooley (“The Witcher”), Michael Wildman (“Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw”), Jude Akuwudike (“Beasts of No Nation”), Bilal Hasna (“Sparks”) and Janine Duvitski (“Benidorm”).\n\nSet 183 years before the events chronicled in the original trilogy of films, “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” tells the fate of the House of Helm Hammerhand, the legendary King of Rohan. A sudden attack by Wulf, a clever and ruthless Dunlending lord seeking vengeance for the death of his father, forces Helm and his people to make a daring last stand in the ancient stronghold of the Hornburg— a mighty fortress that will later come to be known as Helm’s Deep. Finding herself in an increasingly desperate situation, Héra, the daughter of Helm, must summon the will to lead the resistance against a deadly enemy intent on their total destruction.\n\nWith Kamiyama at the helm, the original feature is being produced by Oscar winner Philippa Boyens, from the screenwriting team behind “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” Trilogies, alongside Jason DeMarco and Joseph Chou, who, in addition to their many separate animation projects, collaborated on the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” series. The executive producers are Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson, Sam Register, Carolyn Blackwood and Toby Emmerich. The screenplay is by Jeffrey Addiss & Will Matthews and Phoebe Gittins & Arty Papageorgiou, story by Addiss & Matthews and Boyens, based on characters created by J.R.R. Tolkien. The team of creative collaborators returning from “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy also includes Oscar winners Alan Lee and Richard Taylor, along with esteemed Tolkien illustrator John Howe.\n\nA New Line Cinema Presentation, a Warner Bros. Animation / Sola Entertainment Production, “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” will be distributed theatrically worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, released in cinemas nationwide on December 13, 2024, and internationally beginning 11 December 2024.",

            "description": "Megalopolis sci-fi drama from the iconic Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nMegalopolis is a Roman Epic fable set in an imagined Modern America. The City of New Rome must change, causing conflict between Cesar Catilina, a genius artist who seeks to leap into a utopian, idealistic future, and his opposition, Mayor Franklyn Cicero, who remains committed to a regressive status quo, perpetuating greed, special interests, and partisan warfare. Torn between them is socialite Julia Cicero, the mayor’s daughter, whose love for Cesar has divided her loyalties, forcing her to discover what she truly believes humanity deserves.\n\nMegalopolis stars Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel, Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne, Talia Shire, Jason Schwartzman, Kathryn Hunter, Grace VanderWaal, Chloe Fineman, James Remar, D.B. Sweeney, and Dustin Hoffman. The film is directed, written, and produced by Francis Ford Coppola alongside Anahid Nazarian, Barrie Osborne, and Darren Demetre as executive producers.\n\nMegalopolis is in theaters on September 27.\n\n#Megalopolis #Trailer #IGN",

                "description": "Megalopolis sci-fi drama from the iconic Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nMegalopolis is a Roman Epic fable set in an imagined Modern America. The City of New Rome must change, causing conflict between Cesar Catilina, a genius artist who seeks to leap into a utopian, idealistic future, and his opposition, Mayor Franklyn Cicero, who remains committed to a regressive status quo, perpetuating greed, special interests, and partisan warfare. Torn between them is socialite Julia Cicero, the mayor’s daughter, whose love for Cesar has divided her loyalties, forcing her to discover what she truly believes humanity deserves.\n\nMegalopolis stars Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel, Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne, Talia Shire, Jason Schwartzman, Kathryn Hunter, Grace VanderWaal, Chloe Fineman, James Remar, D.B. Sweeney, and Dustin Hoffman. The film is directed, written, and produced by Francis Ford Coppola alongside Anahid Nazarian, Barrie Osborne, and Darren Demetre as executive producers.\n\nMegalopolis is in theaters on September 27.\n\n#Megalopolis #Trailer #IGN"

            "description": "I started the biggest Ant War in my giant cloud rainforest vivarium. I felt Pantdora and Orchadia, my two connected tropical ecosystem tanks, required a greater biodiversity of ant species, especially because one of the ant species within, i.e Gnome Ants (Pheidole parva) have completely run a monopoly of the rainforest. In an attempt to balance the ant ecology out, I decided to add six more ant species into the vivarium. The result was a war, greater than anything the rainforest had ever seen.

Biden, who ended his reelection campaign in July, outlined his administration's accomplishments in his speech and explained his decision to step down as the Democratic presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"It's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president,\" Biden said in his speech. \"I love the job, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden also said choosing Kamala Harris, who he's since endorsed as candidate for president, as his vice president was \"the best decision I made my whole career.\""

Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal.\n\nAutomate the processing of abstract geometric shapes into more complex ones by cutting, rotating, stacking, painting and more. Deliver distinct shapes to unlock new technologies and expand your factory’s capabilities. Learn, improve, rebuild and solve logistical challenges to design the most efficient shape production lines.\n\nBuild in multiple interconnected layers, allowing you to compact and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension. Improve your designs to get the most benefit out of every space platform built and massively increase your production throughput.\n\nShapez 2 is the purest factory building game imaginable - all buildings are free, resources never run out and there are no enemies or time limits. Prepare for a 100% factory-building experience: effortlessly delete, redesign and rebuild as much as you want, with no penalties, at your own pace.\n\nYou’re always in complete control - whether the messy spaghetti belts you built 4 hours ago could use some improvements or a whole circle factory needs to go, Shapez 2 gives you the tools to do it without limitations.\n\nStart your operation from a single asteroid and continuously expand by building new platforms. Unlock new layouts as you progress, and grow from a single belt into a massive multi-station space factory connected by space trains. Design modular blueprintable platforms to build on a massive scale, placing hundreds of buildings with just one click.\n\nPerformance is very important to us, and with the complete rewrite of Shapez 2 in a new engine, we're doing our best to make sure that massive factories run smoothly - even with the all-new 3D visuals!\n\nMulti-Layer 3D Factories: Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension\nTrains: Connect distant stations with a network of space trains\nResearch System: Unlock buildings, mechanics & upgrades in the all-new tech tree\nNew Shape Mechanics: Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic\nGame Modes: 4 game modes, including a hexagonal shape mode\nBlueprint Library: Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone\nAll-new Visuals: Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment\nFluids: Use different types of liquids to process shapes\nAnimated Open Buildings: See exactly what's happening inside buildings in your factory\nUndo/Redo: Up to 50 undo/redo operations",

Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal.\n\nAutomate the processing of abstract geometric shapes into more complex ones by cutting, rotating, stacking, painting and more. Deliver distinct shapes to unlock new technologies and expand your factory’s capabilities. Learn, improve, rebuild and solve logistical challenges to design the most efficient shape production lines.\n\nBuild in multiple interconnected layers, allowing you to compact and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension. Improve your designs to get the most benefit out of every space platform built and massively increase your production throughput.\n\nShapez 2 is the purest factory building game imaginable - all buildings are free, resources never run out and there are no enemies or time limits. Prepare for a 100% factory-building experience: effortlessly delete, redesign and rebuild as much as you want, with no penalties, at your own pace.\n\nYou’re always in complete control - whether the messy spaghetti belts you built 4 hours ago could use some improvements or a whole circle factory needs to go, Shapez 2 gives you the tools to do it without limitations.\n\nStart your operation from a single asteroid and continuously expand by building new platforms. Unlock new layouts as you progress, and grow from a single belt into a massive multi-station space factory connected by space trains. Design modular blueprintable platforms to build on a massive scale, placing hundreds of buildings with just one click.\n\nPerformance is very important to us, and with the complete rewrite of Shapez 2 in a new engine, we're doing our best to make sure that massive factories run smoothly - even with the all-new 3D visuals!\n\nMulti-Layer 3D Factories: Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension\nTrains: Connect distant stations with a network of space trains\nResearch System: Unlock buildings, mechanics & upgrades in the all-new tech tree\nNew Shape Mechanics: Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic\nGame Modes: 4 game modes, including a hexagonal shape mode\nBlueprint Library: Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone\nAll-new Visuals: Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment\nFluids: Use different types of liquids to process shapes\nAnimated Open Buildings: See exactly what's happening inside buildings in your factory\nUndo/Redo: Up to 50 undo/redo operations"

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\n\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #HereForAReason #InTheDarkestTime",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\n\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #HereForAReason #InTheDarkestTime"
