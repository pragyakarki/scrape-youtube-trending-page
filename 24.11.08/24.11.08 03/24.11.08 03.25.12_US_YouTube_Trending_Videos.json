I had thought it was dead, but it seems the ecosystem and conditions within the vivarium were perfect for the egg's incubation, as it failed to rot and decompose even after over a month later. I felt, for my safety and that of the animals within the vivarium, it was time to take matters into my own hands and dig up the mystery egg to candle it and check for a living fetus.

            "description": "Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix brings back the CH2 Island, but reimagined with weekly POI and weapon drops inspired by some of the greatest music icons of all time.\n\nEach week one classic location of the Chapter 2 Remix map will be taken over by one of the four artists. In addition to the location change, each artist will also have a weapon themed to them. See the weekly breakdown:\n\nWeek 1 (starting November 2nd)\nThe Agency compound is now The Doggpound. The Doggfather will gift you Snoop’s Drum Gun Mythic if you can defeat him, and will join you as an ally!\n\nWeek 2 (starting November 7th)\nThe Grotto lair turns into Spaghetti Grotto. And if you can defeat Eminem, he’ll join your cause and bestow you with his RG Minigun. \n\nWeek 3 (starting November 14th)\nThe Shark is now dubbed Ice Isle with Ice Spice claiming dibs! Defeat Ice to add her to your team and get Ice Spice’s Grappler and Ice Spice’s Rifle Mythics!\n\nWeek 4 (starting November 21st)\nKeep an eye to the skies at the WRLD Point landmark arriving in Week 4.\n\nIn addition to the Remix aspect of weekly artist takeovers, you’ll notice that familiarity is also in the air. Favorite vehicles like Choppas and Motorboats return later in the season. Classic Chapter 2 weapons are also making an appearance as they unvault throughout the season. There’s also new vehicle features like the 1966 Cadillac DeVille which has hydraulics, bounces to music, and can jump in the air!\n\nFinally, with Chapter 2 Remix you’re getting an all-new Chapter 2 inspired Pass. This pass includes Outfits like: Chaos Director, 1-Ball, Undercover Skye, Meowdas, and Dynamo TNTina. Not to mention Kicks– a new cosmetic type that will be featured for the first time in the Remix Pass with a pair of Jordan’s. \n\nThrowback and look forward in Chapter 2 Remix.\n\n#FortniteChapter2Remix #Chapter2Remix #FortniteCh2Remix\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode. One giant map, A Battle Bus, Last one standing wins.

                "description": "Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix brings back the CH2 Island, but reimagined with weekly POI and weapon drops inspired by some of the greatest music icons of all time.\n\nEach week one classic location of the Chapter 2 Remix map will be taken over by one of the four artists. In addition to the location change, each artist will also have a weapon themed to them. See the weekly breakdown:\n\nWeek 1 (starting November 2nd)\nThe Agency compound is now The Doggpound. The Doggfather will gift you Snoop’s Drum Gun Mythic if you can defeat him, and will join you as an ally!\n\nWeek 2 (starting November 7th)\nThe Grotto lair turns into Spaghetti Grotto. And if you can defeat Eminem, he’ll join your cause and bestow you with his RG Minigun. \n\nWeek 3 (starting November 14th)\nThe Shark is now dubbed Ice Isle with Ice Spice claiming dibs! Defeat Ice to add her to your team and get Ice Spice’s Grappler and Ice Spice’s Rifle Mythics!\n\nWeek 4 (starting November 21st)\nKeep an eye to the skies at the WRLD Point landmark arriving in Week 4.\n\nIn addition to the Remix aspect of weekly artist takeovers, you’ll notice that familiarity is also in the air. Favorite vehicles like Choppas and Motorboats return later in the season. Classic Chapter 2 weapons are also making an appearance as they unvault throughout the season. There’s also new vehicle features like the 1966 Cadillac DeVille which has hydraulics, bounces to music, and can jump in the air!\n\nFinally, with Chapter 2 Remix you’re getting an all-new Chapter 2 inspired Pass. This pass includes Outfits like: Chaos Director, 1-Ball, Undercover Skye, Meowdas, and Dynamo TNTina. Not to mention Kicks– a new cosmetic type that will be featured for the first time in the Remix Pass with a pair of Jordan’s. \n\nThrowback and look forward in Chapter 2 Remix.\n\n#FortniteChapter2Remix #Chapter2Remix #FortniteCh2Remix\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode. One giant map, A Battle Bus, Last one standing wins.

Collaborate with your friends to build and upgrade the Thermal Tower. Team up now to explore the new map, face mighty bosses, secure new deviations, and discover even more exciting content!\n\nThe apocalypse changed everything. Human, animal, plant… all are infested by an alien creature – Stardust. As a Meta-Human, you can survive the contamination and use the power of Stardust. Play alone or join others to fight, build and explore. When the world is in chaos, you are our last hope.\n\nSurvive in the wilderness\nYou wake up in the middle of nowhere. You'll have to brace yourself for the cruelty of nature (from monsters to lack of food); however, Stardust's influence does not restrict to living things, it also affects the soil and water. Eating polluted food and drinking dirty water will reduce your Sanity. When your Sanity drops, your max HP would drop accordingly. To eat or not to eat, it's a question.\n\nFight against monsters\nBattle numerous enemies that are once human, and challenge bosses from another dimension to gain powerful items and ease Stardust pollution. You are not only fighting for yourself, but also fighting for the survivors.\n\nCustomize weapons\nWith about 100 gun blueprints divided into seven categories for you to collect and craft, every loot grants you something new. Did I mention accessories and gun perks? Right, they are the heroes here. If our current weapon cannot satisfy your need, you can add different parts and perks, upgrade your firearm to your heart's content.\n\nBuild territory\nUse Territory Core to build a house of your own. You can keep a practical style, jamming everything needed in a small room; or you can design a townhouse with a patio, kitchen, garage… The best part is, you can relocate your territory any time you want!\n\nFind out the truth\nDelve into the truth of Stardust, find out where it came from, and what it wants. In the journey of seeking truth, you may feel alone, but you are never alone. There are several factions in the world, some can be violent and hostile, others might be friendly and helpful. Explore human settlements to learn their stories or exterminate bosses without leaving a name for survivors to praise, the choices are yours.",

Cette année, il est déterminé à mener Zeus, Oner, Gumayusi et Keria vers une 5e victoire pour T1 et un deuxième titre consécutif.\n\nLe parcours de T1 n’a pas été sans embuche en 2024. 4e des LCK, elle a été la dernière équipe à se qualifier pour les Worlds et a débuté avec un 0-1 en phase à système suisse. Depuis, ils n’ont cessé de s’améliorer. Ils ont vaincu leur rival Gen.G et ont fait taire tous les sceptiques.\n\nMais, une dernière équipe leur barre la route, et pas des moindres : Bilibili Gaming, la première équipe de LPL et possiblement la meilleure équipe au monde. Menée par l’impitoyable joueur du haut, Bin, BLG est déterminée à remporter les Worlds pour redonner à la LPL sa suprématie mondiale. Au milieu, Knight veut se venger de sa défaite aux Worlds 2023 contre T1 quand il jouait chez JDG. Sans parler des talentueux Xun, Elk et ON, qui meurent d’envie de mettre la main sur la Coupe de l’invocateur 2024.\n\nFinale du mondial 2024 :\nT1 contre BLG\n\nC'est l'heure des Worlds 2024 ! \n\nRegardez les #Worlds2024 et encouragez vos équipes préférées sur https://lolesports.com\n\nPlay-ins : 25 - 29 sept.\nPhase à système suisse : 3 - 13 oct.\nPhase finale : 17 oct. - 2 nov.\nFinale et cérémonie d'ouverture de la finale : 2 nov.\n\nPour ne rien rater du meilleur des #Worlds2024, suivez LoL Esports sur les réseaux sociaux :\n\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/lolesports_fr\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/lolesports\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/lolesports\nTikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@lolesports\nThreads Meta : https://www.threads.net/@lolesports\nWhatsApp : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaoXKW0HwXbHjXvCdC34\n\nTéléchargez League of Legends maintenant : http://leagueoflegends.com/download"

Самая непобедимая команда в истории Чемпионата мира. В сердце каждого состава один из величайших игроков в истории League of Legends — Faker. В этом году он решительно настроен привести Zeus, Oner, Gumayusi и Keria к пятому подряд Чемпионату мира T1 — и к пятой победе.\n\nПуть T1 в 2024 году выдался непростым. Заняв четвертое место в LCK, они стали последней командой, прошедшей на Чемпионат мира, и начали со счета 0:1 в стадии по швейцарской системе. Тем не менее, они стали только сильнее, одолев своих региональных конкурентов GEN и отбросив все сомнения.\n\nОднако на пути T1 к пятому титулу стоит Bilibili Gaming — лучшая команда в Китае и, возможно, в мире. Возглавляемая беспощадным Bin на верхней линии, команда BLG с нетерпением ждет Чемпионата мира, который вернет LPL мировое господство. Knight на средней линии стремится отомстить T1 за то, что они выбили его и JDG из гонки на Чемпионате мира 2023, и на каждой линии команду представляют таланты мирового уровня, Xun, Elk и ON, — BLG полны решимости завоевать Кубок призывателей 2024 года.\n\nФинал ЧМ-2024:\nT1 против BLG\n\nЧМ-2024 уже НАЧАЛСЯ! \n\nСмотрите #Worlds2024 на https://lolesports.com и поверьте в победу\n\nПредварительная стадия: 25–29 сентября\nСтадия по швейцарской системе: 3–13 октября\nСтадия плей-офф: 17 октября — 2 ноября\nФинал и церемония его открытия: 2 ноября\n\nЧтобы всегда быть в курсе главных событий #Worlds2024, подписывайтесь на LoL Esports в соцсетях:\n\nVK: https://vk.com/leagueoflegends\nVK: https://vk.com/leagueoflegends\nVK: https://vk.com/leagueoflegends\nVK: https://vk.com/leagueoflegends\nVK: https://vk.com/leagueoflegends\nWhatsapp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaoXKW0HwXbHjXvCdC34\n\nЗагрузить League of Legends: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/ru-ru/download/"

W tym roku z determinacją prowadzi Zeusa, Onera, Gumayusiego i Kerię do piątego mistrzostwa świata z rzędu.\n\nW 2024 podróż T1 nie była łatwa.

Ale rośli w siłę, pokonując regionalnych rywali z GEN i uciszając niedowiarków.\n\nLecz na drodze T1 do piątego tytułu stoją Bilibili Gaming, najlepsza ekipa z Chin i prawdopodobnie najmocniejsza drużyna na Ziemi. BLG to zespół prowadzony z górnej alei przez straszliwego Bina, który pragnie zdobyć mistrzostwo świata, by region LPL odzyskał globalną dominację. Knight ze środkowej alei chce zemścić się na T1 po tym, jak został wyeliminowany wraz z JDG z Mistrzostw 2023, a pozostałym zawodnikom nie brakuje umiejętności: Xun, Elk i ON z BLG także za wszelką cenę zechcą zdobyć puchar Przywoływacza 2024.\n\nFinał Mistrzostw 2024:\nT1 kontra BLG\n\nMistrzostwa 2024 TRWAJĄ! \n\nObserwujcie #Worlds2024, aby uwierzyć: https://lolesports.com\n\nRunda wstępna: 25–29 września\nRunda szwajcarska: 3–13 października\nFaza pucharowa: 17 października–2 listopada\nWielki finał i ceremonia otwarcia: 2 listopada\n\nAby na bieżąco śledzić najlepsze wydarzenia #Worlds2024, obserwujcie LoL Esports w mediach społecznościowych:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lolesports\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lolesports\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lolesports\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@lolesports\nMeta Threads: https://www.threads.net/@lolesports\nWhatsapp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaoXKW0HwXbHjXvCdC34\n\nPobierzcie League of Legends teraz: http://leagueoflegends.com/download"

LCK 4시드로서 가장 뒤늦게 월드 챔피언십 출전권을 확보했고, 스위스 스테이지에서는 0승 1패로 시작했습니다. 하지만 T1은 더욱더 강해졌습니다. 지역 라이벌인 GEN 꺾었으며, 그 과정에서 모든 의심을 잠재웠습니다.\n\n그렇지만 다섯 번째 우승을 향해 나아가는 T1을 막아서는 팀이 있으니, 바로 Bilibili Gaming입니다. 중국의 1시드이자 명실상부한 세계 최강의 팀이지요. BLG는 매서운 탑 라이너 Bin 선수를 필두로, LPL을 다시 한번 세계의 정상에 올려놓을 월드 챔피언십 우승에 굶주려 있습니다. 또, 미드 라이너 Knight 선수는 2023년 월드 챔피언십에서 JDG 소속이었던 자신을 탈락시킨 T1을 향해 복수의 칼을 갈고 있습니다. 그뿐일까요? Xun, Elk, ON 선수까지 BLG는 모든 공격로에서 세계 정상급 선수진을 거느리고 2024 소환사의 컵을 손에 넣으려 하고 있습니다.\n\n2024 월드 챔피언십 결승\nT1 vs BLG\n\n2024 월드 챔피언십의 막이 올랐습니다! \n\nhttps://lolesports.com에서 #2024월드챔피언십 경기를 시청하고 믿음을 가져보세요.\n\n플레이-인 스테이지: 9월 25일~29일\n스위스 스테이지: 10월 3일~13일\n토너먼트 스테이지: 10월 17일~11월 2일\n최종 결승 및 개막식: 11월 2일\n\n소셜 미디어에서 리그 오브 레전드 e스포츠를 팔로우하고 #2024월드챔피언십 최신 정보와 명장면을 확인하세요.\n\nLoL e스포츠■ LIVE & LIVE VOD- 네이버: https://game.naver.com/esports- 아프리카TV: http://bj.afreecatv.com/aflol- 트위치: https://www.twitch.tv/lck_korea■ LCK 채널 구독 및 좋아요!- LoL e스포츠 홈페이지: https://lolesports.com/- LCK 공식 페이스북: https://www.facebook.com/officiallck- LCK 공식 인스타그램: https://www.instagram.com/lckofficial/- LCK 공식 틱톡: https://tiktok.com/@lck_official- LCK 공식 트위터 (영문): https://twitter.com/lck_global\n\n리그 오브 레전드 다운로드하기: http://leagueoflegends.com/download"
