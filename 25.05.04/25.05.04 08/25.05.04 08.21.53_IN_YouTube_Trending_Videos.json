Soon Jethalal and Mr Iyer get into an ugly fight. Everyone in the society asks them to break it off or else, they won't be in talking terms with both of them. Later, Madhavi informs Daya about the fight.\n\nShow Name – Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah\nStar Cast –  Dilip Joshi, Disha Vakani, Amit Bhatt, Raj Anankat\nEpisode No - 543\nProduced By -  Asit Kumarr Modi\n\n#TaarakMehtaKaOoltahChashmah #तारकमेहताकाउल्टाचश्मा #sonypal #Latest #tmkoc #TaarakMehtaKaOoltahChashmah2025 #tmkocfunnyepisodes #hindicomedy #comedyvideo \n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah: \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired by the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr Tarak Mehta. This story evolves around happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues that are socially relevant. The show predominantly revolves around 'Jethalaal' (Dilip Joshi), an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Sailesh Lodha), is his neighbour. 'Jethalaal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Raj Anankat). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalaal' to reform 'Tapu' or be prepared to leave the premises.\n\nClick Here To Watch More Episodes Of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PLfyXOEyr93G3QQIKGExbP8b1NqpJKa_xb\n\nक्यों हुई Jetha और Iyer के बीच Ugly Fight? | Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah | 1 May 2025",

Soon Jethalal and Mr Iyer get into an ugly fight. Everyone in the society asks them to break it off or else, they won't be in talking terms with both of them. Later, Madhavi informs Daya about the fight.\n\nShow Name – Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah\nStar Cast –  Dilip Joshi, Disha Vakani, Amit Bhatt, Raj Anankat\nEpisode No - 543\nProduced By -  Asit Kumarr Modi\n\n#TaarakMehtaKaOoltahChashmah #तारकमेहताकाउल्टाचश्मा #sonypal #Latest #tmkoc #TaarakMehtaKaOoltahChashmah2025 #tmkocfunnyepisodes #hindicomedy #comedyvideo \n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah: \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired by the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr Tarak Mehta. This story evolves around happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues that are socially relevant. The show predominantly revolves around 'Jethalaal' (Dilip Joshi), an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Sailesh Lodha), is his neighbour. 'Jethalaal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Raj Anankat). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalaal' to reform 'Tapu' or be prepared to leave the premises.\n\nClick Here To Watch More Episodes Of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PLfyXOEyr93G3QQIKGExbP8b1NqpJKa_xb\n\nक्यों हुई Jetha और Iyer के बीच Ugly Fight? | Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah | 1 May 2025"

This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nNitish Bhaluni / Raj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nSachin Shroff / Shailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nNidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani / Khushi Mali as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder Suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak / Kiran Bhatt as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nNavina Wadekar / Monika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia",

This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu.

            "description": "Haircare Routine : Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. Oil Massage Before Shampooing :\nRegular oiling nourishes the scalp, reduces dryness, strengthens hair follicles, and adds shine over time. Always massage your scalp gently to promote better blood circulation.\n\n2. Essential Oil Addition :\nMix 3 drops of essential oil like rosemary with your carrier oil to boost hair growth. Additionally, after every wash, spray rosemary water on your scalp for improved results.\n\n3. Use Mild Shampoos and Conditioners :\nChoose mild shampoos instead of harsh, chemical-laden products. Always condition your hair after every wash, especially if you have frizzy hair. Otherwise, condition at least twice a week. Try reverse conditioning (conditioning before shampoo) twice a month for extra nourishment.\n\n4. Weekly Hair Mask Routine :\nApply a mild or homemade hair mask once a week to deeply condition and hydrate your hair. Regular use improves texture, adds shine, and reduces frizz and breakage.\n\n5. Use Lukewarm or Cool Water :\nAlways rinse your hair with lukewarm or cool water. Hot water strips away natural oils, making hair dry and more prone to breakage.\n\n6. Gentle Shampooing Technique :\nAvoid rubbing the scalp harshly. Apply an adequate amount of shampoo and gently massage with your fingertips or a hair massaging tool. When rinsing, carefully squeeze out excess water without twisting or pulling the hair.\n\n7. Scalp Care :\nMaintaining a clean, healthy scalp promotes better hair growth. Exfoliate the scalp gently and keep it moisturized. Wash your hair 2–3 times a week.\n\n8. Switch to Microfiber Towels :\nReplace regular towels with microfiber towels. They are softer and much gentler on both hair and scalp, reducing friction and breakage.\n\n9. Hair Serum Application : \nHair serum plays a vital role during the hair growth journey. It locks in moisture and smooths frizz. Always apply serum on damp or towel-dried hair, not dry hair.\n\n10. Avoid Heat Styling Tools :\nMinimize or completely avoid heat styling tools like dryers, straighteners, and curlers. If you must use them, always apply a heat protectant spray to shield your hair from damage.\n\n11. Sleep on Satin Pillowcases : \nSleeping on satin pillowcases reduces friction, prevents frizz, and is much gentler on your hair. If possible, sleep without pillows for better blood circulation, but ensure you are still resting on a satin surface.\n\n12. Cover Your Hair When Going Out :\nShield your hair from dust, pollution, and UV rays by covering it with a scarf, bandana, or using a silk-lined cap under helmets. Alternatively, opt for loose buns or braids instead of leaving your hair open.\n\n13. Tie Hair in a Braid or Loose Bun :\nTying hair in a loose braid or bun helps minimize friction and breakage compared to tighter hairstyles like ponytails.\n\n14. Switch to a Wooden Comb :\nUse a wooden comb instead of plastic. Wooden combs help reduce static, distribute natural oils evenly, enhance shine, and are gentler, minimizing hair breakage.\n\n15. Night Haircare Routine :\nBefore sleeping, gently comb your hair with a wooden comb and secure it in a protective hairstyle (like a loose braid). Sleep on a satin pillowcase for added protection.\n\n16. Focus on Food Intake :\nNutrition is crucial. Consume protein and iron-rich foods like boiled eggs (once or twice a day), green vegetables, and fruits. Monitor your iron levels, as iron deficiency can cause hair fall. Additionally, soak almonds overnight, drink the water, and eat the soaked almonds the next morning for great results.\n\n17. Choose the Right Haircut :\nHaircuts play an important role. For volume and bounce, basic U-cuts and straight cuts work well, especially for thinning hair. Avoid layers, feathers, or V-cuts if you’re experiencing hair fall. Regularly trim split ends to support healthy hair growth.\n\n18. Be Cautious with Hair Treatments :\nResearch thoroughly before opting for any hair treatments. Personally, treatments like keratin caused damage rather than improvements. Stick to natural methods unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\n---\n\nImportant Final Note:\n\nPatience is key. Visible results like baby hairs may take 3–6 months.\n\nInitial hair fall is normal when introducing rosemary, but it should gradually decrease over time.\n\nMonitor your hair: If excessive hair fall persists after 1–1.5 months, reconsider the products you're using, as they might not be suitable for you.",
