            "title": "Why Is A Free BANANA Breaking The Steam Market? - STEAM IS PERFECTLY BALANCED WITH NO EXPLOITS!",
            "description": "Welcome one and all to a one off unique look at a free game called Banana in this game you simply click a banana and watch a number go up. But is this just a front for a very elaborate pump and dump scheme that is going to go down as steams greatest bag holding event in history? Probably. Anyway I the spiffing brit am here to see if I can exploit the banana game and make a profit from trading these speculative banana prices. Who needs GME stocks, crypto and dogecoin when instead you can work the infinite money printing exploit known as Banana and grantee 1000% profit... Probably... Ok probably not.\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts.

                "description": "Bienvenidos todos a una mirada única a un juego gratuito llamado Banana. En este juego, simplemente haces clic en una banana y ves cómo aumenta un número. Pero, ¿es esto sólo una fachada para un plan muy elaborado de bombeo y descarga que se convertirá en el mayor evento de retención de bolsas de la historia? Probablemente. De todos modos, yo, el británico elegante, estoy aquí para ver si puedo explotar el juego del plátano y obtener ganancias negociando estos precios especulativos del plátano. ¿Quién necesita acciones de GME, criptomonedas y dogecoin cuando, en cambio, puedes utilizar el exploit de impresión de dinero infinito conocido como Banana y obtener un beneficio del 1000%... Probablemente... Ok, probablemente no.\n\nLo que has visto hoy aquí es parte de una serie fantástica y perfectamente equilibrada en YouTube en la que voy de juego en juego y los rompo con hazañas extravagantes para ganar cosas como oro ilimitado. Si te gustó esto, asegúrate de ver más. El estilo es similar al juego RT y callmekevin en algunas partes. Una gran influencia en esta serie provino de Valefisk y The Killian Experience. \n\n¡Así que siéntate, relájate y disfruta de este intento de explotar Steam Market! ¿Cómo diablos puede un cabrón inglés romper el mercado con una manipulación casual del mercado? Quién sabe, tal vez sólo perdamos unos cientos de libras con esta estúpida idea."

            "description": "Metallica is lighting it up inside Fortnite: new Festival Season, M72 World Tour stage in Battle Royale, high-octane Rocket Racing track, and a playable concert. https://fn.gg/Metallica\n\nJames, Lars, Kirk, and Robert: these four are the Icons of Fortnite Festival Season 4! But they’re not just here to perform — they’re here to battle. Season 4 brings a new experience that’ll stick around after Season 4 ends: the PvP Battle Stage! 16 players enter, one will emerge victorious.\n\nRide the Lightning guitars will be on the Battle Royale Island! These instruments are as mobile as they are musical… Use one to create a lightning arc in the sky that your squadmates can ride. On your descent, come crashing down to bring the beginning of an enemy’s end.\nOh yeah, you can also earn an Emote and Loading Screen from Battle Royale’s Metallica Quests! These sequentially available Quests, plus the other marks of Metallica, will be in BR ‘til July 2, 2024, at 9 AM ET.\n\nYou’ve got the fuel, the fire, but it’s still not hot enough. Turn up the temperature on Rocket Racing’s new Thrash Mountain track! This volcanic track is a tribute to all things rock — and not just the geology kind. You’ve got instrumental monuments, a stretch of road like a fretboard, and Metallica’s “Fuel” playing in the background.\n\nExperience a Metallica concert like no other in Metallica: Fuel. Fire. Fury. This journey through six fan-favorite songs features gameplay that matches the intensity. Check out https://fn.gg/Metallica for showtimes.",

                "description": "That's Not My Neighbor 100% speedruns require 23 achievements, some requiring a bunch of luck, and others that are just soul crushing for how long they are\n\nGet That's Not My Neighbor here: https://nachogames.itch.io/thats-not-my-neighbor\nI found the 40 win strategy I used from @LumirexTv when researching the run. Go check them out if you want to watch some cool horror game challenge content!\n\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\nWatch live at: https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nWatch the world record speedrun here: this video\n\nIf you're wondering why my number of ranks didn't match up with the amount of runs I did by the end, it's because nightmare mode doesn't give you a rank. It just says you beat it or not, but thankfully it still counts for the achievements.\n\nThat's Not My Neighbor description:\n\nThe Doppelganger Detection Department (D.D.D.) needs you!\n\nThere is a vacancy for the doorman position in your building and since you need the money and can't find a job you have no choice.\n\nIt's 1955 and for unknow reasons doppelganers are more common than normal, so the D.D.D.  has taken action on the matter.\n\nYour job will be to allow or deny the entry of the subjects who request entry to the building, it seems easy, but be careful, you can't overlook any detail because you could be food for doppelgangers.\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #ThatsNotMyNeighbor #Speedrun"

            "description": "The Wild Robot - In Theaters September 27\n\nFrom DreamWorks Animation comes a new adaptation of a literary sensation, Peter Brown’s beloved, award-winning, #1 New York Times bestseller, The Wild Robot. \n\nThe epic adventure follows the journey of a robot—ROZZUM unit 7134, “Roz” for short — that is shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and must learn to adapt to the harsh surroundings, gradually building relationships with the animals on the island and becoming the adoptive parent of an orphaned gosling. \n\nThe Wild Robot stars Academy Award® winner Lupita Nyong’o (Us, The Black Panther franchise) as robot Roz; Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, The Mandalorian) as fox Fink; Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara (Schitt’s Creek, Best in Show) as opossum Pinktail; Oscar® nominee Bill Nighy (Living, Love Actually) as goose Longneck; Kit Connor (Heartstopper, Rocketman) as gosling Brightbill and Oscar® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once, this summer’s The Fall Guy) as Vontra, a robot that will intersect with Roz’s life on the island. \n\nThe film also features the voice talents of Emmy winning pop-culture icon Mark Hamill (Star Wars franchise, The Boy and the Heron), Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows, The SpongeBob Movie franchise) and Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee Ving Rhames (Mission: Impossible films, Pulp Fiction). \n\nA powerful story about the discovery of self, a thrilling examination of the bridge between technology and nature and a moving exploration of what it means to be alive and connected to all living things, The Wild Robot is written and directed by three-time Oscar® nominee Chris Sanders—the writer-director of DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon, The Croods, and Disney’s Lilo & Stitch—and is produced by Jeff Hermann (DreamWorks Animation’s The Boss Baby 2: Family Business; co-producer, Kung Fu Panda franchise). \n\nPeter Brown’s The Wild Robot, an illustrated middle-grade novel first published in 2016, became a phenomenon, rocketing to #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. The book has since inspired a trilogy that now includes The Wild Robot Escapes and The Wild Robot Protects. Brown’s work on the Wild Robot series and his other bestselling books have earned him a Caldecott Honor, a Horn Book Award, two E.B. White Awards, two E.B. White Honors, a Children’s Choice Award for Illustrator of the Year, two Irma Black Honors, a Golden Kite Award and a New York Times Best Illustrated Book Award. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dreamworksthewildrobot\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewildrobot\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.TheWildRobotMovie.com\n#TheWildRobotMovie",

Post-launch, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies. Round-Based Zombies is back! Black Ops 6 will launch with two brand-new Round-Based Zombie maps – Terminus and Liberty Falls – and a continuation of the intriguing and terrifying Dark Aether narrative that was started in Black Ops Cold War.

For newcomers, Zombies is Treyarch’s unique take on a cooperative player experience where you face off against vast mobs of zombified creatures, with the bulk being the recently deceased, now animated due to strange, eldritch forces.
