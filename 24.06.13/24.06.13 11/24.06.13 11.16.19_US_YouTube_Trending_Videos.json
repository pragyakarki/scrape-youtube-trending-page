James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo from Metallica are the Icons of Fortnite Festival Season 4 — and they’re not just here to perform, they’re here to battle. Season 4 will introduce the Battle Stage, a brand-new, musical PVP experience in Fortnite where 16 players will enter, but only one can emerge victorious. Compete against your opponents across a four-song setlist to be the last one standing when the curtain comes down and it all fades to black.

            "description": "Metallica is lighting it up inside Fortnite: new Festival Season, M72 World Tour stage in Battle Royale, high-octane Rocket Racing track, and a playable concert. https://fn.gg/Metallica\n\nJames, Lars, Kirk, and Robert: these four are the Icons of Fortnite Festival Season 4! But they’re not just here to perform — they’re here to battle. Season 4 brings a new experience that’ll stick around after Season 4 ends: the PvP Battle Stage! 16 players enter, one will emerge victorious.\n\nRide the Lightning guitars will be on the Battle Royale Island! These instruments are as mobile as they are musical… Use one to create a lightning arc in the sky that your squadmates can ride. On your descent, come crashing down to bring the beginning of an enemy’s end.\nOh yeah, you can also earn an Emote and Loading Screen from Battle Royale’s Metallica Quests! These sequentially available Quests, plus the other marks of Metallica, will be in BR ‘til July 2, 2024, at 9 AM ET.\n\nYou’ve got the fuel, the fire, but it’s still not hot enough. Turn up the temperature on Rocket Racing’s new Thrash Mountain track! This volcanic track is a tribute to all things rock — and not just the geology kind. You’ve got instrumental monuments, a stretch of road like a fretboard, and Metallica’s “Fuel” playing in the background.\n\nExperience a Metallica concert like no other in Metallica: Fuel. Fire. Fury. This journey through six fan-favorite songs features gameplay that matches the intensity. Check out https://fn.gg/Metallica for showtimes.",

            "description": "The Wild Robot - In Theaters September 27\n\nFrom DreamWorks Animation comes a new adaptation of a literary sensation, Peter Brown’s beloved, award-winning, #1 New York Times bestseller, The Wild Robot. \n\nThe epic adventure follows the journey of a robot—ROZZUM unit 7134, “Roz” for short — that is shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and must learn to adapt to the harsh surroundings, gradually building relationships with the animals on the island and becoming the adoptive parent of an orphaned gosling. \n\nThe Wild Robot stars Academy Award® winner Lupita Nyong’o (Us, The Black Panther franchise) as robot Roz; Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, The Mandalorian) as fox Fink; Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara (Schitt’s Creek, Best in Show) as opossum Pinktail; Oscar® nominee Bill Nighy (Living, Love Actually) as goose Longneck; Kit Connor (Heartstopper, Rocketman) as gosling Brightbill and Oscar® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once, this summer’s The Fall Guy) as Vontra, a robot that will intersect with Roz’s life on the island. \n\nThe film also features the voice talents of Emmy winning pop-culture icon Mark Hamill (Star Wars franchise, The Boy and the Heron), Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows, The SpongeBob Movie franchise) and Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee Ving Rhames (Mission: Impossible films, Pulp Fiction). \n\nA powerful story about the discovery of self, a thrilling examination of the bridge between technology and nature and a moving exploration of what it means to be alive and connected to all living things, The Wild Robot is written and directed by three-time Oscar® nominee Chris Sanders—the writer-director of DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon, The Croods, and Disney’s Lilo & Stitch—and is produced by Jeff Hermann (DreamWorks Animation’s The Boss Baby 2: Family Business; co-producer, Kung Fu Panda franchise). \n\nPeter Brown’s The Wild Robot, an illustrated middle-grade novel first published in 2016, became a phenomenon, rocketing to #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. The book has since inspired a trilogy that now includes The Wild Robot Escapes and The Wild Robot Protects. Brown’s work on the Wild Robot series and his other bestselling books have earned him a Caldecott Honor, a Horn Book Award, two E.B. White Awards, two E.B. White Honors, a Children’s Choice Award for Illustrator of the Year, two Irma Black Honors, a Golden Kite Award and a New York Times Best Illustrated Book Award. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dreamworksthewildrobot\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewildrobot\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.TheWildRobotMovie.com\n#TheWildRobotMovie",

DeleteMe international Plans: https://international.joindeleteme.com 🙌\n\nThe recent DMCA takedown notice from the ESA on popular rom sharing site VIMMS Lair is another blow to the preservation community. Nintendo believes ROM sites are haven for illegal activity, copyright infringement, and piracy and they have a history of taking down sites in the past including LoveROMs, Rom Universe and more. Can Nintendo be trusted to do it themselves? The Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) service is a fraction of the size of the Virtual Console and its unlikely it will ever exceed it. It's my view that Nintendo is effectively erasing their own history as more games are lost to time. In today's episode we take a closer look at why I believe the only true preservation in the video game industry are ROMS.\n\nNote: This episode is an opinion piece for entertainment purposes only.

                "description": "🔒Remove your personal information from the web at https://JoinDeleteMe.com/MVG and use code MVG for 20% off. DeleteMe international Plans: https://international.joindeleteme.com 🙌\n\nThe recent DMCA takedown notice from the ESA on popular rom sharing site VIMMS Lair is another blow to the preservation community. Nintendo believes ROM sites are haven for illegal activity, copyright infringement, and piracy and they have a history of taking down sites in the past including LoveROMs, Rom Universe and more. Can Nintendo be trusted to do it themselves? The Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) service is a fraction of the size of the Virtual Console and its unlikely it will ever exceed it. It's my view that Nintendo is effectively erasing their own history as more games are lost to time. In today's episode we take a closer look at why I believe the only true preservation in the video game industry are ROMS.\n\nNote: This episode is an opinion piece for entertainment purposes only.

Post-launch, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies. Round-Based Zombies is back! Black Ops 6 will launch with two brand-new Round-Based Zombie maps – Terminus and Liberty Falls – and a continuation of the intriguing and terrifying Dark Aether narrative that was started in Black Ops Cold War. Hordes of the undead are set to rampage through these brand-new locations, each offering countless hours of fast-paced action where power-ups are plentiful, but you’re never more than a few seconds away from being overwhelmed and devoured! For newcomers, Zombies is Treyarch’s unique take on a cooperative player experience where you face off against vast mobs of zombified creatures, with the bulk being the recently deceased, now animated due to strange, eldritch forces. Expect every location you visit to be packed with powerful weapons, new and returning power-ups, a pantheon of revolting entities to face, and a host of secrets and easter eggs to discover.\n\n➖ Follow me! ➖\n🐥 Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/MrDalekJD\n📘 Facebook - http://facebook.com/MrDalekJD\n📸 Instagram - http://instagram.com/MrDalekJD\n🚨Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmn6qb15MOEDxa8DyqxIzhQ\n👾 Join the MrDalekJD Discord - https://discord.gg/Wc28nWzkmB\n\n➖ The equipment I use! ➖\n🎧 The headset I use - https://astro.family/mrdalekjdEMEA\n\nSubscribe for more videos!\n- MrDalekJD\n\nBusiness Enquiries: business@mrdalekjd.com\n\nLet's keep the comment section AWESOME to make sure everyone has a good time!

                "description": "FIRST OFFICIAL BLACK OPS 6 ZOMBIES GAMEPLAY DETAILS REVEALED!\n►👍 LIKE the video if you're excited for Black Ops 6 Zombies! ✅ Subscribe to not miss ANYTHING!\n►Exclusive BO6 Campaign & Multiplayer Details: https://youtu.be/FM2JSZedbeU\n\nBlack Ops 6 also marks the return of Round-Based Zombies, the fan-favorite mode where players will take down hordes of the undead in two brand-new maps at launch. Post-launch, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies. Round-Based Zombies is back! Black Ops 6 will launch with two brand-new Round-Based Zombie maps – Terminus and Liberty Falls – and a continuation of the intriguing and terrifying Dark Aether narrative that was started in Black Ops Cold War. Hordes of the undead are set to rampage through these brand-new locations, each offering countless hours of fast-paced action where power-ups are plentiful, but you’re never more than a few seconds away from being overwhelmed and devoured! For newcomers, Zombies is Treyarch’s unique take on a cooperative player experience where you face off against vast mobs of zombified creatures, with the bulk being the recently deceased, now animated due to strange, eldritch forces. Expect every location you visit to be packed with powerful weapons, new and returning power-ups, a pantheon of revolting entities to face, and a host of secrets and easter eggs to discover.\n\n➖ Follow me! ➖\n🐥 Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/MrDalekJD\n📘 Facebook - http://facebook.com/MrDalekJD\n📸 Instagram - http://instagram.com/MrDalekJD\n🚨Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmn6qb15MOEDxa8DyqxIzhQ\n👾 Join the MrDalekJD Discord - https://discord.gg/Wc28nWzkmB\n\n➖ The equipment I use! ➖\n🎧 The headset I use - https://astro.family/mrdalekjdEMEA\n\nSubscribe for more videos!\n- MrDalekJD\n\nBusiness Enquiries: business@mrdalekjd.com\n\nLet's keep the comment section AWESOME to make sure everyone has a good time!
