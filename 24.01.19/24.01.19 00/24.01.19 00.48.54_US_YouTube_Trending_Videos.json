Just go ahead and vote for Big Yeti below. \n\nhttps://www.votepca.com/pop-culture/the-athlete\n\nThen we get right into wildcard weekend with Travis recapping the coldest football game ever played at Arrowhead, revealing what lengths players went to to stay warm, and why Rashee Rice has suddenly been unstoppable. \n\nWe then get to Jason and the Eagles coming up short in Tampa capping off a rough end of the season. Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. \n\nThe guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. \n\nWe also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question. \n\nAnd for those of you looking to compete in our first-ever fan contest, we will be putting out the full \"Best Team Name\" bracket and link to enter later today.

In this video, we go over their strategy to divide and conquer the Palestinian people, keeping them physically and politically divided so their land can be taken.\n\nSpecial thanks to Max Fisher, Sam Ellis, and Nathan Thrall.\n\nWatch the Search Party video on the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors: https://youtu.be/mBXnj_kM_cA?si=SyyGtgho6_xNFOWV\n\nCheck out all my sources for this video here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IlXbZDgURzoQDdRJ_SFX6CiLMU-ZsgwDvnjUkdhx0IY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nCheck out my new channel with Sam Ellis - Search Party: https://youtube.com/@Search-Party\n\nGet access to behind-the-scenes vlogs, my scripts, and extended interviews over at https://www.patreon.com/johnnyharris\n\nDo you have an insider tip or unique information on a story?

Luka Doncic led Dallas with 33 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists. The Lakers have won their second consecutive game and are back to .500 at 21-21 as the Mavericks move to 24-18.\nThis is the third time Russell, James, and Davis have scored 25+ points in a game each, which marks the most such games this season by a specific trio. They are one of two trios in the league to have multiple 25+ points games together (Sacramento – Keegan Murray, De’Aaron Fox, & Domantas Sabonis, 2x).\nLuka Doncic totaled his seventh triple-double of the season, only Domantas Sabonis (11) and Nikola Jokic (12 have more. This is the 63rd triple-double of Luka’s career. All seven of Luka’s triple-doubles this season have been 30-point triple doubles (N.

                "description": "Let's dive into the engineering and construction of the Channel Tunnel on its 30th anniversary.\n💡 Go to https://brilliant.org/PracticalEngineering for a 30-day free trial & the first 200 people will get 20% off their annual subscription.\n\nIt is a challenging endeavor to put any tunnel below the sea, and this monumental project faced some monumental hurdles. From complex cretaceous geology, to managing air pressure, water pressure, and even financial pressure, there are so many technical details I think are so interesting about this project.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-how-the-channel-tunnel-works\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

            "description": "Trivia revenge is a dish best served with a side of jerk chicken. Hi, I’m Krebs Gorlon the owner/operator of this YouTube channel (not affiliated with MrBeast) and I’m here today to share with you a video. A lovely video indeed about three stunted men in their 40’s that dress up in Star Trek costumes and play a 30-year-old trivia game. Real men are out there in the cold fixing downed electrical lines, savings lives at hospitals, or providing air traffic control for our nations busiest airports. These men are doing this…. In olden days they would have been called “village idiots” perhaps even court jesters. Morons who shame thyselves for the delight of the King. In the 1800’s they would be circus freaks or even clowns – a shameful profession that does nothing for the betterment of the world other than entertain the regular townsfolk while they slurp down turkey legs coated in meat slime. With every stale laugh, stinky belch-filled chuckle, and gape-mouthed pointed finger, a piece of their soul is taken away. If there was any soul to begin with. Today, morons, clowns, court jesters, and idiots are called “YouTubers”. From dimwits opening up a Walmart “toy haul”, to content thieves reacting to “hair dye fails”, and buffoons playing a board game so you can watch them play it, this generation of artless village idiots have a new bell to ring in the town square. Just a digital one that uploads 9,000,000,000,000 hours of new content every second. I’m afraid to say our dear friends at RLM are no different. For this channel is filled with endless tales told by idiots full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but Star Trek trivia and the occasional movie review. This time Mike is out for revenge. In our last battle, Mike was winning and made a crucial mistake in the final question. This prompted the internet to crown Rich Evans as the king of all TNG trivia. Winning by a simple question doth not make one a king of trivia. Showing relentless and consistent knowledge is how to achieve that. I’m afraid to say Mike has and will continue to do that time and time again with surgeon-like precision. Evans, I hate to say it, is on his last leg mentally. Sure, Mike makes a mistake here and there, but his wit and knowledge remain strong and intact. Not much remains in Evans’ soiled soul. His meat sack body is nothing but a rotting bag of regret. Sure, he remembers some things about TNG, but did he retain anything else? Probably not. He’s seen with his own eyes Star Trek turn into a living nightmare and a joke. Star Trek was once a bastion of hope for lonely nerds in High School. If you liked Star Trek The Next Generation (or Star Trek in general) you were relentlessly mocked. Why? Because the show was thoughtful, proposed interesting ideas, and was scientifically methodical. It was the opposite of cool. It was the opposite of an exciting football game or going to a concert and pushing your friends in a mosh pit. Now, Star Trek is a football game and a mosh pit. It’s made for the dimwits who can’t hold their attention for 5 minutes without a joke or a quip or a stupid comment or something exploding or something dumb happening. No, our last sanctuary, if you will, is cuddling up with that warm blanket of nostalgia with a show that will never happen again. Committing each and every episode and it’s details to memory. To save and preserve a glorious time when life was worth living. So sit back and relax. Pour yourself a frosty beverage and watch as the last of the greatest generation mull over trivia questions read to them by a man who is allergic to barbers. Watch two old friends who met in 1995 and bonded over comic books and Star Trek, things that would get you beat up back then but are now cool, push their memories to the limit in a trivia battle for the soul of our nation. - Krebs Gorlon",

                "title": "An Ant War Broke Out After Adding Water Beasts into My Giant Rainforest Vivarium",
                "description": "In my giant cloud rainforest vivarium, I call Pantdora, an unexpected revival of an ant war broke out, after adding a team of aquatic creatures to the pond. I was shocked to discover the truth about relations between three existing ant colonies within the vivarium, and watched an intense showdown of ants take place. It opened my eyes to the chilling realities of invasive vs native animal wars that occur in ecosystems, as they compete for resources, food, and space. Hope you enjoy Part 8 of our Ecosystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever!

                "description": "Tesla's Cybertruck Can't Beat A New Porsche 911 In The 1/4 Mile (Towing)\nCybertruck vs F-150 Tug-of-War Stunt - https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\n\nDuring Tesla's Cybertruck delivery event, they showcased the Cybertruck performing stunts to show it's performance capabilities versus the competition. One of those stunts was a drag race against a Porsche 911, while *towing* a Porsche 911. Insane, yes! Elon Musk claimed “it can tow a Porsche 911 across the 1/4 mile faster than the Porsche 911 can go by itself\" after showing a clip of it beating a Porsche 911 in an 1/8th mile drag race. Fair statement? Not exactly.\n\nThis video seeks to answer the question: which car is really faster in the 1/4 mile, a 2023 Porsche 911, or Tesla's Cybertruck towing a 911? We'll use real world data, along with some math to find the answer. \n\nRelated Videos:\nFord Lightning 1M LB Towing Stunt - https://youtu.be/Au3U72CX74I\nSSC Tuatara Hits \"331 MPH\" - https://youtu.be/4jqCdBKl0ME\nCybertruck Tug-of-War - https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w\n\nRelevant Links:\nTesla Cybertruck - https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck\nCybertruck Delivery Event - https://youtu.be/FU6r3BmlgBM\nCar and Driver 911 T - https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a42030495/2023-porsche-911-carrera-t-drive/\nMotorTrend 911 T - https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2023-porsche-911-carrera-t-first-test-review/\nCar and Driver Base 911 - https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a32365967/2020-porsche-911-carrera-by-the-numbers/\n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\nRecommended Books & Car Products - http://amzn.to/2BrekJm\nEE Shirts! - http://bit.ly/2BHsiuo\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA"

            "description": "🇮🇹 Italian Street Food in Florence: https://youtu.be/UIct1iwOqEY \n👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n🌶 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ \n\nNAPLES, ITALY - Welcome Naples, one of the Italian cultural and food capitals of the country. It’s very cool city with so much to explore and so today we’re going on a food tour to eat just a taste of some of the best Italian food and learn a little about this exciting Italian city! \n\nHuge thank you to Chiara and my friends from Culinary Backstreets (https://culinarybackstreets.com/)  for arranging this amazing day for me. Highly recommended in Naples or other cities where they offer tours. \n\nHere’s everything we ate on this Naples food tour: \n\nPasticceria Capriccio - This old bakery in Naples is most famous for their Baba, a rum soaked cake, originating in Poland and France, but loved and adapted into Naples. \n\nNext up Chiara took us on an exploration of one of the oldest markets in Naples, a place where you can really see the culture and life of Naples. It loved the colorful mix of fresh vegetables, clothes, Maradona shops, and artisans. The main thing I tried in the market was Limonata a cosce aperte - “open legs lemonade” - lemon juice, sulfur water, and bicarbonate!\n\nÈ Pronto ‘O Mangià - Now we’re moving on to some of the best Italian food I’ve had - a variety of spaghetti pasta dishes, a truly Naples food institution. We tried spaghetti alle vongole - Neapolitan style spaghetti with clams, spaghetti alla Pignatiello - spaghetti with mixed seafood, and frittura di paranza - mixed fried seafood, all of which were outstanding. Without a doubt the seafood spaghetti was the best spaghetti of my life and cooked perfectly. \n\nLombardi 1892 - You can’t go to Naples without eating pizza, and the original Neapolitan pizza. Pizza was invented in and around Naples, and they have the world’s original pizzeria. While we didn’t go to the original pizzeria, we went to a place that serves traditional Naples pizza and some of the best. This time, just had to go with the classic - Pizza Margherita - tomatoes, basil, buffalo mozzarella, and it was everything I hoped for! \n\nSorbillo Pizza Fritta - Finally to wrap up this Italian street food tour in Naples I couldn't leave without trying deep fried pizza. I met up with some friends and deep fried pizza at Sorbillo Pizza Fritta. It’s definitely something that’s a little messy, but extremely tasty - loaded with melty oozing cheese and tomato sauce!\n\nIf you love food, Naples is a city you have to visit. There’s always something unique and exciting everywhere you look - What a city! \n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n🌶 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n🎥 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)",

Pizza was invented in and around Naples, and they have the world’s original pizzeria. While we didn’t go to the original pizzeria, we went to a place that serves traditional Naples pizza and some of the best. This time, just had to go with the classic - Pizza Margherita - tomatoes, basil, buffalo mozzarella, and it was everything I hoped for! \n\nSorbillo Pizza Fritta - Finally to wrap up this Italian street food tour in Naples I couldn't leave without trying deep fried pizza. I met up with some friends and deep fried pizza at Sorbillo Pizza Fritta. It’s definitely something that’s a little messy, but extremely tasty - loaded with melty oozing cheese and tomato sauce!\n\nIf you love food, Naples is a city you have to visit. There’s always something unique and exciting everywhere you look - What a city! \n\nSocial Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n🌶 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n🎥 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are Amazon affiliate links)"

It’s very cool city with so much to explore and so today we’re going on a food tour to eat just a taste of some of the best Italian food and learn a little about this exciting Italian city! \n\nHuge thank you to Chiara and my friends from Culinary Backstreets (https://culinarybackstreets.com/)  for arranging this amazing day for me. Highly recommended in Naples or other cities where they offer tours. \n\nHere’s everything we ate on this Naples food tour: \n\nPasticceria Capriccio - This old bakery in Naples is most famous for their Baba, a rum soaked cake, originating in Poland and France, but loved and adapted into Naples. \n\nNext up Chiara took us on an exploration of one of the oldest markets in Naples, a place where you can really see the culture and life of Naples. It loved the colorful mix of fresh vegetables, clothes, Maradona shops, and artisans. The main thing I tried in the market was Limonata a cosce aperte - “open legs lemonade” - lemon juice, sulfur water, and bicarbonate!\n\nÈ Pronto ‘O Mangià - Now we’re moving on to some of the best Italian food I’ve had - a variety of spaghetti pasta dishes, a truly Naples food institution. We tried spaghetti alle vongole - Neapolitan style spaghetti with clams, spaghetti alla Pignatiello - spaghetti with mixed seafood, and frittura di paranza - mixed fried seafood, all of which were outstanding. Without a doubt the seafood spaghetti was the best spaghetti of my life and cooked perfectly. \n\nLombardi 1892 - You can’t go to Naples without eating pizza, and the original Neapolitan pizza.
