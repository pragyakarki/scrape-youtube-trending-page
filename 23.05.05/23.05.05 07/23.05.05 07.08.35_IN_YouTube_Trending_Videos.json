The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).\n“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. \nVilleneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel.  The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick.  The executive producers are Josh Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.\nVilleneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West.  Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.\n“Dune: Part Two” was filmed on location in Budapest, Abu Dhabi, Jordan and Italy.  The film is slated for a November 3, 2023 worldwide release from Warner Bros. Pictures.",

Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family. He respects and values the morals and traditions of his family and refuses to let the family down.\n\nMeerab’s life takes an unexpected turn when she finds out about her family’s decision regarding her and Murtasim’s life. Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself. On the other hand, Meerab who is used to living her life on her own terms refuses to accept Murtasim’s family traditions and unnecessary social barriers.\n\nSoon their lives go through a series of emotional sufferings and misunderstandings where it becomes difficult for them to coexist. Despite their hatred towards each other, will Meerab and Murtasim accept their true feelings or will the dynamics of ego and self-respect force them to stay apart?\n\nWriter: Nooran Makhdoom\nDirector: Siraj ul Haq\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nYumna Zaidi as Meerab\nWahaj Ali as Murtasim\nBushra Ansari as Salma\nSohail Sameer as Anwar\nSabeena Farooq as Haya\nHira Soomro as Maryam\nFazila Qazi as Aneela\nFarhan Ally Agha as Waqas\nSeemi Pasha as Sabra\nMahmood Aslam as Malik Mukhtaar\nHaris Waheed\nAgha Mustafa\n\n#terebin \n#yumnazaidi \n#wahajali",

Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family. He respects and values the morals and traditions of his family and refuses to let the family down.\n\nMeerab’s life takes an unexpected turn when she finds out about her family’s decision regarding her and Murtasim’s life. Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself. On the other hand, Meerab who is used to living her life on her own terms refuses to accept Murtasim’s family traditions and unnecessary social barriers.\n\nSoon their lives go through a series of emotional sufferings and misunderstandings where it becomes difficult for them to coexist. Despite their hatred towards each other, will Meerab and Murtasim accept their true feelings or will the dynamics of ego and self-respect force them to stay apart?\n\nWriter: Nooran Makhdoom\nDirector: Siraj ul Haq\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nYumna Zaidi as Meerab\nWahaj Ali as Murtasim\nBushra Ansari as Salma\nSohail Sameer as Anwar\nSabeena Farooq as Haya\nHira Soomro as Maryam\nFazila Qazi as Aneela\nFarhan Ally Agha as Waqas\nSeemi Pasha as Sabra\nMahmood Aslam as Malik Mukhtaar\nHaris Waheed\nAgha Mustafa\n\n#terebin \n#yumnazaidi \n#wahajali"

In 2011, then Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar visited India. Bhutto landed arrived on May 4 to attend SCO Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Goa. Amid strained ties with India, Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said that his participation in a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Council in India reflected Islamabad's commitment to the charter of the SCO and should not be seen in terms of bilateral ties. India has formally sent invitations to all members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization including Pakistan and China for the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Relations between the two countries have been precarious for many years with regard to issues of cross-border terrorism from Pakistan. On Bhutto’s visit, India’s Ministry of External Affairs had said that it will not be appropriate to focus on a particular member. \n\n#BilawalBhutto #SCO #Jaishankar\n\nSubscribe now and press the bell icon 🔔 to get new video updates: https://bit.ly/2UV4ygi\n\n--------------------------------------\nANI is South Asia's leading Multimedia News Agency providing content for every information platform, including TV, Internet, broadband, newspapers, and mobiles. \nSubscribe now!

Pushpa, the oldest of them, is the head constable who tries to balance her life between home and work. Karishma, the Sub Inspector, is fish out of the water as she is at loggerheads with the philosophy of the police station. She beats before she talks but now she has to solve all cases through reconciliation. Santosh Sharma is a young new recruit and a typical lonely girl in the city. The head of the pack is S.H.O Haseena Mallik, witty, romantic leads by example. The common challenge for all these women is to bring sensitivity to their policing while dealing with cases that come to this police station. Hence their solution is most unusual. The characters and the cases add to the fun and humor of the show. While Pushpa and Karishma are the saas-bahu duo, who keep us entertained by their Squabbles, it is Haseena - Karishma's ideological differences that add to the drama madam and comedy",

                "description": "Karishma Singh के थप्पड़ ने दिया करारा जवाब || Maddam Sir - Ep.17\n\nShow Name – Maddam Sir\nStar Cast – Gulki Joshi, Shilpa Shinde, Yukti Kapoor, Sonali Naik, Bhavika Sharma, Pankhuri Awasthy Rode, Priyanshu Singh, and Ajay Jadhav\nProduced By – Jay Mehta\n\n#MaddamSir #मैड्डमसर #comedy \n\nAbout The Show:\n-----------------------------\nSet in Lucknow the show is based in one such all-women Police station made by 4 beautiful quirky women. Pushpa, the oldest of them, is the head constable who tries to balance her life between home and work. Karishma, the Sub Inspector, is fish out of the water as she is at loggerheads with the philosophy of the police station. She beats before she talks but now she has to solve all cases through reconciliation. Santosh Sharma is a young new recruit and a typical lonely girl in the city. The head of the pack is S.H.O Haseena Mallik, witty, romantic leads by example. The common challenge for all these women is to bring sensitivity to their policing while dealing with cases that come to this police station. Hence their solution is most unusual. The characters and the cases add to the fun and humor of the show. While Pushpa and Karishma are the saas-bahu duo, who keep us entertained by their Squabbles, it is Haseena - Karishma's ideological differences that add to the drama madam and comedy"
