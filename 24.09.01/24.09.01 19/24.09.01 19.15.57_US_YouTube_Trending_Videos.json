Luis Gómez)\n\nVivo por ella sin saber\nSi la encontré o me ha encontrado\nYa no recuerdo como fue\nPero al final me ha conquistado\nVivo por ella que me da \nToda mi fuerza de verdad\nVivo por ella y no me pesa.\n\nVivo por ella yo también\nNo te me pongas tan celoso\nElla entre todas es la más\nDulce y caliente como un beso\nElla a mi lado siempre está\nPara apagar mi soledad\nMas que por mi por ella\nYo vivo también\n\nEs la musa que te invita\nA tocarla suavecita\n\nEn mi plano a veces triste\nLa muerte no existe\nSi ella esta aquí\n \nVivo por ella que me da\nTodo el afecto que le sale\nA veces pega de verdad\n \nPero es un puño que no duele​\n \nVivo por ella que me da\nFuerza, valor y realidad\nPara sentirme un poco vivo\n\nCómo duele quando falta\nVivo por ella en un hotel\nCómo brilla fuerte y alta\nVivo por ella en propia piel\n\nSi ella canta en mi garganta,\nMis penas mas negras espanta\n\nVivo por ella y nadie más\nPuede vivir dentro de mi\nElla me da la vida, la vida...\nSi está junto a mi.\n\nSi está junto a mi\nDesde un palco o contra un muro\nVivo por ella al limite\nEn el trance mas oscuro\nVivo por ella integra\n\nCada dia una conquista\nLa protagonista\nEs ella también\n\nVivo por ella porque va\nDandome siempre la salida\nPorque la música es asi\nFiel y sincera de por vida\n\nVivo por ella que me da\nNoches de amor y libertad\nSi hublese otra vida, la vivo...\nPor ella también\n\nElla se llama música\nY es mia también\nVivo por ella créeme\nPor ella también\nIo vivo per lei\nIo vivo\nPer lei\n\n________\n\nVIDEO CREDITS\n\nFOR KAROL G\nCreative Directed by Pedro Artola @pedro.artola \n(Both KAROL G & Andrea Bocelli’s shoot)\nEdit: CHERRYCOLA @askforcherrycola\nColor: Lucas Hope @lucashopedotcom\nGraphics: Miguel De la Vega @migueldelavegaheredia\n\nMADRID TEAM\nProduced by Sample @thisis_sample\nExecutive Produce: Mayca Márquez @maycamarquez,  Edu Lozano @lozano_edu\nProduction manager: Gema Ruiz @_gemaruiz_\nProduction coordinator: Ana Buendía @_wendi\nDP​​: ​Daniel Mere @daniel_mere_ by @planbfree\nAD​​: ​Sonia Beltrán @soniabeltrang\nStylist​​: Alba Melendo @albamelendo\nStylist assistant: María Bravo @mabraiz\nStylist assistant​: Joel Escalonilla @joelescall\nArt director​: Virginia Sancho @virginia_sancho\nArt assistant​​: Araceli Navarro @aracelinavarro_\nStand by props: Alvaro Soler\nStand by props: Reinaldo Bracamonte @reinaldo.bracamonte\nFocus puller​: ​Pablo Pascual @pablopascual \nCamera assistant ​Javier Almazán @javieralmazan_ \nVideo assistant​: Alex Ramos @alexramoscalvo\nDIT:​​ ​Selu Sánchez @selu.mosquito\nSteady: Marc Oliver @marc_oliver_take_1 \nSteady assistant: Emilio Maldonado @emilio_maldonado\nGaffer​​: Eduardo Luzón @eluzongaffer\nSpark​​: Hector Cazalla @hectorcazalla\nSpark​​​: Iván Rodriguez\nSpark​: ​Javier Rodriguez\nSpark​​: ​Juan Antonio Velázquez\nSpark​​: Oscar Alejano @alejanooscar\nPA​​: ​Dani Barrio @dani_barrio\nPA​​: ​Sergi Cerezuela @sergiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\nPA​​: ​Guillermo Fdez Egea @guillefegea\nCamera​​: Sercivi @sercivicamaras\nLighting​: ​Aluzine @aluzine\nProduction​: ​Rolling @rolling_surolling\nCatering​: Cuchara de Palo @cucharadepalocatering\n \nFOR ANDREA BOCELLI \nDirector & DOP for Andrea Bocelli: Gaetano Morbioli\nProduction Company: Run Production\nAssistant Director: Federica Filippini\nProducer: Laura Castellotti\n1ST AC: Alessio Stefenato\nAssistant Operator:Massimiliano Urbani\nSet Designer: Ermes Archetti\nTechnical supervisor for NSHOT: Francesco Maria Volpe\nMake up and hair for Andrea Bocelli: Antonella Melani\n\nandreabocelli.com\n\n#andreabocelli #duets #karolg #andreabocellilive"

            "description": "A new era is born.\n\nNext summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, breakthrough talent Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an intrepid team racing to secure DNA samples from the three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure genetic material from the world’s three most massive dinosaurs. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on an island where they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that’s been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team leader; Emmy nominee and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of this summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

            "title": "Tyrese Gibson On Katt Williams Being a Prophet & Shannon Sharpe's Viral Orange Birkin Bag",
            "description": "Tyrese Gibson joins Shannon Sharpe in this episode of Club Shay Shay for an unfiltered and insightful conversation that dives deep into his life, career, and the experiences that have shaped him.\n\nThe episode starts on a playful note as Tyrese humorously tells Shannon he needs to moisturize, setting the tone for a lively discussion. The two reminisce over a glass of Coca-Cola, with Tyrese sharing the story behind his iconic Coke commercial—a defining moment that skyrocketed his career. He reveals how he arrived late to the audition but still managed to land the role, earning his first $100 and feeling like it was Christmas every day since.\n\nThe conversation takes a deeper turn as Tyrese discusses his challenging childhood, being the youngest of four children and the only one not born in St. Louis. He shares how his family moved to LA for his father’s singing career, only for his father to leave when Tyrese was just seven years old. He opens up about his mother’s struggles with alcoholism and her belief that he was special from birth.\n\nIn discussing his film career, Tyrese talks about his latest movie 1992, a project that faced significant hurdles in Hollywood. He shares how Snoop Dogg, the film’s executive producer, played a pivotal role in generating buzz for the movie. Tyrese praises Snoop as a genius who has reinvented himself time and time again, noting that Snoop’s influence is unmatched—even more so than Jay-Z’s. He also mentions how actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis continually reinvent themselves, and how working with Denzel is a dream he has yet to fulfill, as Denzel is the very reason he pursued acting.\n\nTyrese and Shannon also discuss having haters from your own neighborhood like Nipsey Hussle. Then the focus shifts to the power of social media, with Tyrese noting that it has made lying more popular while highlighting that Denzel Washington avoids rumors by staying off social platforms. He humorously recalls the internet clapping back at Shannon for his tote bag and his infamous “two-hour-old” Air Force 1s, showcasing Tyrese’s sharp wit and playful nature.\n\nThe conversation touches on Katt Williams’ memorable appearance on Club Shay Shay, with Tyrese calling him “Prophet Williams” and discussing the impact of Katt’s truth-telling, even when it’s uncomfortable. Tyrese talks about his ongoing joke with Akon and Ludacris about being dark-skinned and how communities like Jewish, Latino, and Asian people are more unified, though Black culture remains the most influential.\n\nTyrese delves into the complexities of relationships, marriage, and the differences between men and women’s expectations, themes that are also explored in his latest album. He speaks about the importance of genuine friendships, especially in environments like Watts, and how the loyalty of his friends kept him on the right path.\n\nFinally, Tyrese reflects on the role of hardship in shaping his identity, asserting that he has no regrets because every struggle has sculpted him into the man he is today.

                "description": "Tyrese Gibson joins Shannon Sharpe in this episode of Club Shay Shay for an unfiltered and insightful conversation that dives deep into his life, career, and the experiences that have shaped him.\n\nThe episode starts on a playful note as Tyrese humorously tells Shannon he needs to moisturize, setting the tone for a lively discussion. The two reminisce over a glass of Coca-Cola, with Tyrese sharing the story behind his iconic Coke commercial—a defining moment that skyrocketed his career. He reveals how he arrived late to the audition but still managed to land the role, earning his first $100 and feeling like it was Christmas every day since.\n\nThe conversation takes a deeper turn as Tyrese discusses his challenging childhood, being the youngest of four children and the only one not born in St. Louis. He shares how his family moved to LA for his father’s singing career, only for his father to leave when Tyrese was just seven years old. He opens up about his mother’s struggles with alcoholism and her belief that he was special from birth.\n\nIn discussing his film career, Tyrese talks about his latest movie 1992, a project that faced significant hurdles in Hollywood. He shares how Snoop Dogg, the film’s executive producer, played a pivotal role in generating buzz for the movie. Tyrese praises Snoop as a genius who has reinvented himself time and time again, noting that Snoop’s influence is unmatched—even more so than Jay-Z’s. He also mentions how actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis continually reinvent themselves, and how working with Denzel is a dream he has yet to fulfill, as Denzel is the very reason he pursued acting.\n\nTyrese and Shannon also discuss having haters from your own neighborhood like Nipsey Hussle. Then the focus shifts to the power of social media, with Tyrese noting that it has made lying more popular while highlighting that Denzel Washington avoids rumors by staying off social platforms. He humorously recalls the internet clapping back at Shannon for his tote bag and his infamous “two-hour-old” Air Force 1s, showcasing Tyrese’s sharp wit and playful nature.\n\nThe conversation touches on Katt Williams’ memorable appearance on Club Shay Shay, with Tyrese calling him “Prophet Williams” and discussing the impact of Katt’s truth-telling, even when it’s uncomfortable. Tyrese talks about his ongoing joke with Akon and Ludacris about being dark-skinned and how communities like Jewish, Latino, and Asian people are more unified, though Black culture remains the most influential.\n\nTyrese delves into the complexities of relationships, marriage, and the differences between men and women’s expectations, themes that are also explored in his latest album.

Handicaps will not be in effect and no strokes will be given to any player. Each foursome will play holes 10 through 17. After these eight holes, the four lowest-scoring players will compete in a one-hole playoff. In the event that there are ties for the lowest four scores, a chip-off will happen on No. 17 to determine the final four. The player closest to the hole would advance to the final playoff hole.\n\nParticipants:\n\nMac Boucher @MacBoucherGolf \nWesley Bryan  @BryanBrosGolf \nGeorge Bryan  @BryanBrosGolf \nAimee Cho  @GolfWithAimee \nGarrett Clark  @GoodGood \nBrad Dalke  @GoodGood \nPeter Finch  @peterfinchgolf \nGabby GolfGirl  @gabbygolfgirl \nLuke Kwon  @LukeKwonGolf \nMicah Morris @Micahmorrisgolf \nMason Nutt  @BustaJackGolf \nFat Perez  @Bobdoessports \nPaige Spiranac @PaigeSpiranac \nRoger Steele @roger_steele\nTyler Toney @dudeperfect  \nSean Walsh @GoodGood \n\nWelcome to the official YouTube channel of the PGA TOUR.

They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.

Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard."

mind\nWell I saw him walk in\nWith his cowboy hat\nAnd I thought to myself\nI could use some of that\nHis boots like glass on a saw dust floor\nHad moves like nothin’ I’d ever seen before\nSo I walked right up\nI pulled him to the side\nI handed him a beer and looked him right in the eye\nAnd I said “Baby, I think you’re gonna wanna hear this”\nI said\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n\nWell I was down at the local beer joint with a few of the guys \nWhen this cute little country girl caught my eye \nAnd boy let me tell you she was the prettiest thing i’d ever seen in a pair of boots\nWell she walked right up to me, handed me a beer \nGave me a look like, lets get outta here \nAnd that's when I realized that she was every cowboys dream come true \nShe told me this right here, she said..\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nSo if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat\n\nAnd you think to yourself\nI could use some of that\nDon’t waste your time\nJust give ‘em this here line\nGoes a little like this\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n  \n#EllaLangley #RileyGreen #youlooklikeyouloveme",

right up\nI pulled him to the side\nI handed him a beer and looked him right in the eye\nAnd I said “Baby, I think you’re gonna wanna hear this”\nI said\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n\nWell I was down at the local beer joint with a few of the guys \nWhen this cute little country girl caught my eye \nAnd boy let me tell you she was the prettiest thing i’d ever seen in a pair of boots\nWell she walked right up to me, handed me a beer \nGave me a look like, lets get outta here \nAnd that's when I realized that she was every cowboys dream come true \nShe told me this right here, she said..\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nSo if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat\n\nAnd you think to yourself\nI could use some of that\nDon’t waste your time\nJust give ‘em this here line\nGoes a little like this\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n  \n#EllaLangley #RileyGreen #youlooklikeyouloveme"

A few months ago, we got a call from The Make-A-Wish foundation. A 12 year old boy named Loren wanted a full sized Bon animatronic, and after having made a bunch of Poppy Playtime and Five Nights at Freddy's animatronics, we jumped at the opportunity!\n\nOur animatronic Bon the Rabbit has a sturdy welded steel frame and is animated with a wiper motor for the waist, and servos for the head and jaw. Standing over 6' tall, he turned out super intimidating. We even worked with Martin Walls, the creator of the Walten Files for a big surprise for Loren.\n\nWe love how our real life Bon turned out and we really hope Loren likes it too!

Oscar-nominated, singular creative visionary Tim Burton and Oscar nominee and star Michael Keaton reunite for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the long-awaited sequel to Burton’s award-winning Beetlejuice.  \n\nKeaton returns to his iconic role alongside Oscar nominee Winona Ryder (Stranger Things, Little Women) as Lydia Deetz and two-time Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara (Schitt$ Creek, The Nightmare Before Christmas) as Delia Deetz, with new cast members Justin Theroux (Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi, The Leftovers), Monica Bellucci (Spectre, The Matrix films), Arthur Conti (House of the Dragon) in his feature film debut, with Emmy nominee Jenna Ortega (Wednesday, Scream VI) as Lydia’s daughter, Astrid, and Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (Poor Things, At Eternity’s Gate).\n\nBeetlejuice is back!  After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River.  Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened.  With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice's name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.\n\nBurton, a genre unto himself, directs from a screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (Wednesday), story by Gough & Millar and Seth Grahame-Smith (The LEGO® Batman Movie), based on characters created by Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson.

Tickets Now Available #ChristopherReeveStory\n\nhttps://www.fathomevents.com/events/super-man-the-christopher-reeve-story/\n\nThe story of Christopher Reeve is an astonishing rise from unknown actor to iconic movie star, and his definitive portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman set the benchmark for the superhero cinematic universes that dominate cinema today. Reeve portrayed the Man of Steel in four Superman films and played dozens of other roles that displayed his talent and range as an actor, before being injured in a near-fatal horse-riding accident in 1995 that left him paralyzed from the neck down. \n\nAfter becoming a quadriplegic, he became a charismatic leader and activist in the quest to find a cure for spinal cord injuries, as well as a passionate advocate for disability rights and care - all while continuing his career in cinema in front of and behind the camera and dedicating himself to his beloved family.\n\nFrom the directors of McQueen, Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui, this film includes never-before-seen intimate home movies and an extraordinary trove of personal archive material, as well as the first extended interviews ever filmed with Reeve’s three children about their father, and interviews with the A-list Hollywood actors who were Reeve’s colleagues and friends. The film is a moving and vivid cinematic telling of Reeve’s remarkable story. \n\nSuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story is produced by Passion Pictures (Searching For Sugar Man, The Territory) and Misfits Entertainment (McQueen, Rising Phoenix). \n\nNew York-based production studio Words + Pictures financed and also produced the film. Words+Pictures, founded in 2021 by Connor Schell, is led by the creators and producers of the 30 for 30 series, the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, and the 2017 Oscar-winning O.J.: Made in America.
