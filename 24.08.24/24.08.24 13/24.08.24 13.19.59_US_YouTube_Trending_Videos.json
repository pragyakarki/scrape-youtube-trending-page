            "description": "Peter Jackson presents a groundbreaking journey back to Middle-earth through the eyes of legendary director Kenji Kamiyama.\n#LOTR The War of the Rohirrim - only in theaters Christmas.\n\nNew Line Cinema’s original anime feature “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” returns audiences to the epic world brought to life in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, based on the revered books by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nUnder the direction of award-winning filmmaker Kenji Kamiyama (the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” and “Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex” TV series), the talented voice cast is led by Brian Cox (“Succession”) as Helm Hammerhand, the mighty King of Rohan; Gaia Wise (“A Walk in the Woods”) as his daughter Héra; and Luke Pasqualino (“Snowpiercer”) as Wulf. Miranda Otto, who delivered an unforgettable, award-winning performance in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, reprises her role as Éowyn, Shieldmaiden of Rohan, who serves as the tale’s narrator. The voice ensemble also includes Lorraine Ashbourne (Netflix’s “Bridgerton”), Yazdan Qafouri (“I Came By”), Benjamin Wainwright (“World on Fire”), Laurence Ubong Williams (“Gateway”), Shaun Dooley (“The Witcher”), Michael Wildman (“Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw”), Jude Akuwudike (“Beasts of No Nation”), Bilal Hasna (“Sparks”) and Janine Duvitski (“Benidorm”).\n\nSet 183 years before the events chronicled in the original trilogy of films, “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” tells the fate of the House of Helm Hammerhand, the legendary King of Rohan. A sudden attack by Wulf, a clever and ruthless Dunlending lord seeking vengeance for the death of his father, forces Helm and his people to make a daring last stand in the ancient stronghold of the Hornburg— a mighty fortress that will later come to be known as Helm’s Deep. Finding herself in an increasingly desperate situation, Héra, the daughter of Helm, must summon the will to lead the resistance against a deadly enemy intent on their total destruction.\n\nWith Kamiyama at the helm, the original feature is being produced by Oscar winner Philippa Boyens, from the screenwriting team behind “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” Trilogies, alongside Jason DeMarco and Joseph Chou, who, in addition to their many separate animation projects, collaborated on the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” series. The executive producers are Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson, Sam Register, Carolyn Blackwood and Toby Emmerich. The screenplay is by Jeffrey Addiss & Will Matthews and Phoebe Gittins & Arty Papageorgiou, story by Addiss & Matthews and Boyens, based on characters created by J.R.R. Tolkien. The team of creative collaborators returning from “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy also includes Oscar winners Alan Lee and Richard Taylor, along with esteemed Tolkien illustrator John Howe.\n\nA New Line Cinema Presentation, a Warner Bros. Animation / Sola Entertainment Production, “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” will be distributed theatrically worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, released in cinemas nationwide on December 13, 2024, and internationally beginning 11 December 2024.",

                "description": "Peter Jackson presents a groundbreaking journey back to Middle-earth through the eyes of legendary director Kenji Kamiyama.\n#LOTR The War of the Rohirrim - only in theaters Christmas.\n\nNew Line Cinema’s original anime feature “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” returns audiences to the epic world brought to life in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, based on the revered books by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nUnder the direction of award-winning filmmaker Kenji Kamiyama (the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” and “Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex” TV series), the talented voice cast is led by Brian Cox (“Succession”) as Helm Hammerhand, the mighty King of Rohan; Gaia Wise (“A Walk in the Woods”) as his daughter Héra; and Luke Pasqualino (“Snowpiercer”) as Wulf. Miranda Otto, who delivered an unforgettable, award-winning performance in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, reprises her role as Éowyn, Shieldmaiden of Rohan, who serves as the tale’s narrator. The voice ensemble also includes Lorraine Ashbourne (Netflix’s “Bridgerton”), Yazdan Qafouri (“I Came By”), Benjamin Wainwright (“World on Fire”), Laurence Ubong Williams (“Gateway”), Shaun Dooley (“The Witcher”), Michael Wildman (“Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw”), Jude Akuwudike (“Beasts of No Nation”), Bilal Hasna (“Sparks”) and Janine Duvitski (“Benidorm”).\n\nSet 183 years before the events chronicled in the original trilogy of films, “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” tells the fate of the House of Helm Hammerhand, the legendary King of Rohan. A sudden attack by Wulf, a clever and ruthless Dunlending lord seeking vengeance for the death of his father, forces Helm and his people to make a daring last stand in the ancient stronghold of the Hornburg— a mighty fortress that will later come to be known as Helm’s Deep. Finding herself in an increasingly desperate situation, Héra, the daughter of Helm, must summon the will to lead the resistance against a deadly enemy intent on their total destruction.\n\nWith Kamiyama at the helm, the original feature is being produced by Oscar winner Philippa Boyens, from the screenwriting team behind “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” Trilogies, alongside Jason DeMarco and Joseph Chou, who, in addition to their many separate animation projects, collaborated on the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” series. The executive producers are Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson, Sam Register, Carolyn Blackwood and Toby Emmerich. The screenplay is by Jeffrey Addiss & Will Matthews and Phoebe Gittins & Arty Papageorgiou, story by Addiss & Matthews and Boyens, based on characters created by J.R.R. Tolkien. The team of creative collaborators returning from “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy also includes Oscar winners Alan Lee and Richard Taylor, along with esteemed Tolkien illustrator John Howe.\n\nA New Line Cinema Presentation, a Warner Bros. Animation / Sola Entertainment Production, “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” will be distributed theatrically worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, released in cinemas nationwide on December 13, 2024, and internationally beginning 11 December 2024."

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard."

            "description": "Megalopolis sci-fi drama from the iconic Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nMegalopolis is a Roman Epic fable set in an imagined Modern America. The City of New Rome must change, causing conflict between Cesar Catilina, a genius artist who seeks to leap into a utopian, idealistic future, and his opposition, Mayor Franklyn Cicero, who remains committed to a regressive status quo, perpetuating greed, special interests, and partisan warfare. Torn between them is socialite Julia Cicero, the mayor’s daughter, whose love for Cesar has divided her loyalties, forcing her to discover what she truly believes humanity deserves.\n\nMegalopolis stars Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel, Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne, Talia Shire, Jason Schwartzman, Kathryn Hunter, Grace VanderWaal, Chloe Fineman, James Remar, D.B. Sweeney, and Dustin Hoffman. The film is directed, written, and produced by Francis Ford Coppola alongside Anahid Nazarian, Barrie Osborne, and Darren Demetre as executive producers.\n\nMegalopolis is in theaters on September 27.\n\n#Megalopolis #Trailer #IGN",

Chef is back! But this isn’t your grandpa’s Chef bot. Years of combat have hard-boiled his soul and perfected his culinary abilities. The long legs of past Chefs have been swapped with a huge roller—perfect for flattening out a nice, tidy pie crust or steamrolling whatever helpless Lemurians were unfortunate enough to wake up this morning. \n\nThose years of primal culinary misadventures have trained Chef to have incredible control over his trusty cleavers. Hurl them at faraway enemies and call them back to slice and dice with twice the pain. Master the art of the cleaver and filet your way to victory. \n\nPlayers who cook up something truly delicious will unlock Chef! So, get ready to sauté your way through hordes, blend your combat skills with culinary precision, and serve up some justice… à la mode. \n\n\nFollow Gearbox on Social Media!\n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/gearboxofficial\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gearboxofficial\nInstagram: https://www.Instagram.com/Gearbox\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/GearboxOfficial\nWebsite: https://www.gearboxsoftware.com\nGearbox Store: https://www.gearboxloot.com",

His name is also Wade Wilson. But this Deadpool doesn't have the charm of Ryan Reynolds. \n\nThe only thing this guy has in common with the Marvel hero its that he also leaves death and destruction wherever he goes. And he's about to realize, the hard way, that he is the villain of this story. Not the superhero.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n00:00 - INTRO\n04:55 - GOOD KID GONE BAD\n09:10 - A RELATIONSHIP & RED FLAGS\n12:45 - A TERRIFYING TURN\n14:36 - USELESS!!!\n16:03 - THE BEHAVIOR CONTINUES\n19:05 - ESCALATING VIOLENCE\n22:32 - WADE'S BREAKDOWN\n26:57 - THE CHARGES\n29:19 - WADE'S TRIAL\n31:25 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  : \n\nFACE\n\n-Make Up Forever HD Skin Foundation “1Y16”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY21gAGTS\n\n-Benefit Dew-La-La “Luna”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY4XfPg5x\n\n-Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer “Madeleine”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY5HlMdKW\n\n-Estee Lauder Double Wear Maximum Cover “1N3 Creamy Vanilla”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY8J1ShTz\n\n-Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder “Translucent”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY9SNu7t0\n\n-Nars Bronzing Powder “Laguna”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZakcGT3b\n\n-Haus Labs Color Fuse Glassy Blush Balm “Glassy Rosette”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZaQPktFj\n\n-Wet n Wild Color Icon Blush “Pinch Me Pink”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZbM6PlFJ\n\n-Em Cosmetics Heavens Glow “Magic Hour”\nhttps://bit.ly/4diJ9Sx\n\nEYES\n\n-Rare Beauty Eyeshadow Primer\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZipwRovd\n\n-Melt Cosmetics Metal Bond Gel Liner “Penny”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZjjg7BfT\n\n-Vieve The Essential Palette\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZkiRDrpb\n\n-Tarte Waterproof Mascara “Maneater”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZlMax1ML\n\nLIPS\n\n-MAC Pro Longwear Lip Pencil “In Control”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZo2r91lA (this color may be discontinued)\n\n-Too Faced Hangover Pillow Balm “Cocoa Kiss”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZrmw0Lsk\n\n\nBROWS\n\n-Jecca Blac Brow Gel\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZt4DQXap\n\n-Make Up For Ever Aqua Resist Brow Pencil “Medium Brown”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZuHcxS1O",

I felt Pantdora and Orchadia, my two connected tropical ecosystem tanks, required a greater biodiversity of ant species, especially because one of the ant species within, i.e Gnome Ants (Pheidole parva) have completely run a monopoly of the rainforest. In an attempt to balance the ant ecology out, I decided to add six more ant species into the vivarium. The result was a war, greater than anything the rainforest had ever seen.

Interactive Entertainment and DC.\nThis time around, you are Batman. Land bone-crushing punches. Glide into hapless enemies. Retreat to the shadows. Camouflaj has reimagined the core Arkham experience for VR, drawing particular inspiration from Batman: Arkham Asylum and its intricate and interconnected level design.\nYou’ll need to master all of Batman’s abilities in order to save Gotham City. Set between the events of Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum, you’ll step into the shoes of a relatively young—and increasingly confident—Bruce Wayne as he takes on the Rat King, a dangerous new criminal with a cultish following.\n\nWatch the Gameplay Breakdown of Batman: Arkham Shadow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opwxWJb16i4\nWatch Batman: Arkham Shadow Q&A Round 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1nSTxT9Zwo\nWatch Batman: Arkham Shadow Q&A Round 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-n4XzjgggQ\n\nGet $30 for the Oculus Store and support the channel by using this referral link: https://www.meta.com/referrals/link/ItsTheFreakinBat\nFor instructions on how to redeem Meta Quest Store credits after buying and activating your headset, read here: https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/orders-and-returns/articles/referrals-meta-store/\n\n► YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/BatmanArkhamVideos\n► DISCORD: https://discord.gg/BatmanArkham\n► TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ArkhamVideos\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/arkhamvideos\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BatmanArkhamNews\n\n#Batman #ArkhamShadow #BatmanArkhamShadow #Ratcatcher #BatmanArkham #VR #BatmanArkhamVR\n\nABOUT THIS CHANNEL\n\nBatman Arkham Videos is a fan channel dedicated to bringing you the latest news, guides and videos from the Batman Arkham video game series.\nThis channel is in no way associated with Rocksteady Studios or Warner Bros.

                "description": "The first in-game footage of Batman: Arkham Shadow, a groundbreaking new entry in the famed Arkham series, developed exclusively for Meta Quest 3 by Camouflaj and Oculus Studios, in partnership with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC.\nThis time around, you are Batman. Land bone-crushing punches. Glide into hapless enemies. Retreat to the shadows. Camouflaj has reimagined the core Arkham experience for VR, drawing particular inspiration from Batman: Arkham Asylum and its intricate and interconnected level design.\nYou’ll need to master all of Batman’s abilities in order to save Gotham City. Set between the events of Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum, you’ll step into the shoes of a relatively young—and increasingly confident—Bruce Wayne as he takes on the Rat King, a dangerous new criminal with a cultish following.\n\nWatch the Gameplay Breakdown of Batman: Arkham Shadow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opwxWJb16i4\nWatch Batman: Arkham Shadow Q&A Round 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1nSTxT9Zwo\nWatch Batman: Arkham Shadow Q&A Round 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-n4XzjgggQ\n\nGet $30 for the Oculus Store and support the channel by using this referral link: https://www.meta.com/referrals/link/ItsTheFreakinBat\nFor instructions on how to redeem Meta Quest Store credits after buying and activating your headset, read here: https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/orders-and-returns/articles/referrals-meta-store/\n\n► YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/BatmanArkhamVideos\n► DISCORD: https://discord.gg/BatmanArkham\n► TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ArkhamVideos\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/arkhamvideos\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BatmanArkhamNews\n\n#Batman #ArkhamShadow #BatmanArkhamShadow #Ratcatcher #BatmanArkham #VR #BatmanArkhamVR\n\nABOUT THIS CHANNEL\n\nBatman Arkham Videos is a fan channel dedicated to bringing you the latest news, guides and videos from the Batman Arkham video game series.\nThis channel is in no way associated with Rocksteady Studios or Warner Bros.

Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal.\n\nAutomate the processing of abstract geometric shapes into more complex ones by cutting, rotating, stacking, painting and more. Deliver distinct shapes to unlock new technologies and expand your factory’s capabilities. Learn, improve, rebuild and solve logistical challenges to design the most efficient shape production lines.\n\nBuild in multiple interconnected layers, allowing you to compact and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension. Improve your designs to get the most benefit out of every space platform built and massively increase your production throughput.\n\nShapez 2 is the purest factory building game imaginable - all buildings are free, resources never run out and there are no enemies or time limits. Prepare for a 100% factory-building experience: effortlessly delete, redesign and rebuild as much as you want, with no penalties, at your own pace.\n\nYou’re always in complete control - whether the messy spaghetti belts you built 4 hours ago could use some improvements or a whole circle factory needs to go, Shapez 2 gives you the tools to do it without limitations.\n\nStart your operation from a single asteroid and continuously expand by building new platforms. Unlock new layouts as you progress, and grow from a single belt into a massive multi-station space factory connected by space trains. Design modular blueprintable platforms to build on a massive scale, placing hundreds of buildings with just one click.\n\nPerformance is very important to us, and with the complete rewrite of Shapez 2 in a new engine, we're doing our best to make sure that massive factories run smoothly - even with the all-new 3D visuals!\n\nMulti-Layer 3D Factories: Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension\nTrains: Connect distant stations with a network of space trains\nResearch System: Unlock buildings, mechanics & upgrades in the all-new tech tree\nNew Shape Mechanics: Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic\nGame Modes: 4 game modes, including a hexagonal shape mode\nBlueprint Library: Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone\nAll-new Visuals: Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment\nFluids: Use different types of liquids to process shapes\nAnimated Open Buildings: See exactly what's happening inside buildings in your factory\nUndo/Redo: Up to 50 undo/redo operations",
