I'm Brian Barczyk, and I have been daily vlogging on YouTube since May 10, 2016 sharing my amazing life filled with animals. My journey here on YouTube and social media has been truly magnificent and magical. Since 2016, I've been part of TV network series, produced my own documentary in South Africa, traveled the world to meet incredible animals and animal lovers, started a podcast, created a convention for animal content creators, built and expanded The Reptarium - an interactive reptile Zoo in Utica, Michigan and so much more. \n\nIn March 2023, just as we were ready to break ground on our expanded facility, I received a life-altering diagnosis of inoperable Pancreatic Cancer. Despite the challenges and my fears, the amazing community we've built on YouTube over the last 7+ years has kept me inspired to continue sharing my journey.\n\nNow, I'm fully committed to building our expanded facility, Legasea Aquarium & The Reptarium, just across the street. This project represents resilience and the pursuit of dreams in difficult times. With the incredible support of our community, the #ReptileArmy, we're turning obstacles into opportunities. Together, let's create a brighter future for reptiles and all animals, inspiring others to embrace their passions in the face of adversity.\n\nJoin us on this inspiring journey of discovery, conservation, and hope. Together, we'll make a lasting impact and celebrate the extraordinary animal world.",

            "description": "4 different Hard Bread ration cans opened. First one is quite nice, another is perfectly preserved. Two others... you'll have to see for yourself. The Reserve Ration was used in WW1 and is what evolved to Field Ration Type C, which is the ration that eventually becomes the MRE, or Meal, Ready to Eat, Individual.\nExclusive shelf stable food history from beginning to end. \n\nFilmed October 2019, February 2021, and December 2023.\n\nIntroducing the 1914 US Navy Emergency Ration and 1899 US Standard Emergency Ration in the latter part of this review. Stay tuned for more expensive, rare, and truly fascinating rations from the past.\n\nA good portion of the Reserve Rations used in WW1 were shipped off to Poland after the war. Check out an exclusive photo at the end of the video showing this, and a ration dump with a whole bunch of canned salmon. Truly a fascinating look at not only the ration, but some really cool lost history in the photos as well.\n\nCan 1 2:00\nCan 2 14:01\nCan 3 15:08\nCan 4 27:43\nCan 3 is by far the most amazing. They were vacuum sealed and perfectly preserved hard bread biscuits - much different and more palatable than the first tin's Sunshine hard tack. It turns into a true ration cooking show with a meal that is guaranteed to make you hungry. I sure was when preparing it, after a long day with very little food. It was a meal to remember!\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&ty=h\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/steve1989\n\n\nFor correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my exact mailing information is: \nSteve1989\n3616 Harden Blvd\n360\nLakeland, FL 33803 \n\n\nI only post on YouTube.\n-Steve1989",

                "description": "4 different Hard Bread ration cans opened. First one is quite nice, another is perfectly preserved. Two others... you'll have to see for yourself. The Reserve Ration was used in WW1 and is what evolved to Field Ration Type C, which is the ration that eventually becomes the MRE, or Meal, Ready to Eat, Individual.\nExclusive shelf stable food history from beginning to end. \n\nFilmed October 2019, February 2021, and December 2023.\n\nIntroducing the 1914 US Navy Emergency Ration and 1899 US Standard Emergency Ration in the latter part of this review. Stay tuned for more expensive, rare, and truly fascinating rations from the past.\n\nA good portion of the Reserve Rations used in WW1 were shipped off to Poland after the war. Check out an exclusive photo at the end of the video showing this, and a ration dump with a whole bunch of canned salmon. Truly a fascinating look at not only the ration, but some really cool lost history in the photos as well.\n\nCan 1 2:00\nCan 2 14:01\nCan 3 15:08\nCan 4 27:43\nCan 3 is by far the most amazing. They were vacuum sealed and perfectly preserved hard bread biscuits - much different and more palatable than the first tin's Sunshine hard tack. It turns into a true ration cooking show with a meal that is guaranteed to make you hungry. I sure was when preparing it, after a long day with very little food. It was a meal to remember!\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&ty=h\n\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/steve1989\n\n\nFor correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my exact mailing information is: \nSteve1989\n3616 Harden Blvd\n360\nLakeland, FL 33803 \n\n\nI only post on YouTube.\n-Steve1989"

            "description": "I created my dream tank, a 1000 gallon cloud rainforest vivarium, called Pantdora, and it's purpose is to study how tropical ants and other exotic creatures live in the wild. I already added an initial team of animals into the terrarium, but it was missing a very important player in the food chain: an apex predator. In this episode, we release my chosen apex predator into the Pantdoran rainforest, and the result was pretty awesome. Hope you enjoy this week's episode, Part 7 of my Ecosystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever!

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.

I'm Brian Barczyk, and I have been daily vlogging on YouTube since May 10, 2016 sharing my amazing life filled with animals. My journey here on YouTube and social media has been truly magnificent and magical. Since 2016, I've been part of TV network series, produced my own documentary in South Africa, traveled the world to meet incredible animals and animal lovers, started a podcast, created a convention for animal content creators, built and expanded The Reptarium - an interactive reptile Zoo in Utica, Michigan and so much more. \n\nIn March 2023, just as we were ready to break ground on our expanded facility, I received a life-altering diagnosis of inoperable Pancreatic Cancer. Despite the challenges and my fears, the amazing community we've built on YouTube over the last 7+ years has kept me inspired to continue sharing my journey.\n\nNow, I'm fully committed to building our expanded facility, Legasea Aquarium & The Reptarium, just across the street. This project represents resilience and the pursuit of dreams in difficult times. With the incredible support of our community, the #ReptileArmy, we're turning obstacles into opportunities. Together, let's create a brighter future for reptiles and all animals, inspiring others to embrace their passions in the face of adversity.\n\nJoin us on this inspiring journey of discovery, conservation, and hope. Together, we'll make a lasting impact and celebrate the extraordinary animal world.",

This is exactly what happened to Alaska Airlines flight 2059 and the reason behind it, is what this video is all about. I want to take this time to say that this is an issue that sits very close to my heart and I hope this video will be used to show that ANYONE is susceptible to mental health issues and might require help. We must all work together to fight the stigma surrounding mental health and work towards a safer and more inclusive mental environment, in aviation but also in other sectors. //Petter\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIf you want to support the work I do on the channel, join my Patreon crew and get awesome perks and help me move the channel forward!\n👉🏻 https://www.patreon.com/mentourpilot\n\nOur Connections:\n👉🏻 Exclusive Mentour Merch: https://mentour-crew.creator-spring.com/?\n👉🏻 Our other channel: youtube.com/mentournow\n👉🏻 Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/mentourpilot\n👉🏻 BOSE Aviation: https://boseaviation-emea.aero/headsets\n\nSocial:\n👉🏻 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MentourPilot\n👉🏻 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mentour_pilot\n👉🏻 Twitter: https://twitter.com/MenTourPilot\n👉🏻 Discord server: https://discord.gg/JntGWdn\n\nDownload the FREE Mentour Aviation app for all the lastest aviation content\n👉🏻 https://www.mentourpilot.com/apps/\n\nBelow you will find the links to videos and sources used in this episode.\n\nSOURCES\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n‘Is This Hell?’ The Pilot Accused of Trying to Crash a Plane Tells His Story - By Mike Baker Reporting from Portland, Ore. – The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/us/alaska-airlines-pilot-joseph-emerson-mushrooms.html\n\nDecision Considerations - Aerospace Medical Dispositions - Item 47.

I'm Brian Barczyk, and I have been daily vlogging on YouTube since May 10, 2016 sharing my amazing life filled with animals.

Since 2016, I've been part of TV network series, produced my own documentary in South Africa, traveled the world to meet incredible animals and animal lovers, started a podcast, created a convention for animal content creators, built and expanded The Reptarium - an interactive reptile Zoo in Utica, Michigan and so much more. \n\nIn March 2023, just as we were ready to break ground on our expanded facility, I received a life-altering diagnosis of inoperable Pancreatic Cancer.

This project represents resilience and the pursuit of dreams in difficult times. With the incredible support of our community, the #ReptileArmy, we're turning obstacles into opportunities. Together, let's create a brighter future for reptiles and all animals, inspiring others to embrace their passions in the face of adversity.\n\nJoin us on this inspiring journey of discovery, conservation, and hope.

Anything in nature that flies, from the smallest insect to the largest bird, possesses symmetry. But birds don't fly supersonic. \n\nIn the 1950’s Robert Thomas Jones, a brilliant NASA engineer, began developing a radical new wing arrangement called an oblique wing (also referred to as a skewed wing). The wing design was characterized by a wing that could pivot into a unique angled configuration in relation to the aircraft’s fuselage. The design offered several advantages over more conventional swept wings. An oblique wing’s ability to pivot into a straight wing made it ideal for low speed flight (improving efficiency and take-off/landing performance), but at transonic and supersonic speeds, the angled orientation minimized both wave and induced drag, leading to improved overall aerodynamic efficiency. With lower drag at higher speeds, oblique wing aircraft would require less thrust to maintain a given speed, resulting in reduced fuel consumption and operating costs.  Compared to other variable geometry wings, oblique wings would also be lighter, less complex and have fewer drawbacks like a shifting center of lift.\n\nJones proved his theories through wind tunnel tests and with small scale remote control models. Promising results prompted NASA to undertake more intensive research during the 1970s. The first major step was the propeller-driven Oblique Wing Remotely Piloted Research Aircraft (OWRPRA) which first took flight in 1976. At the same time, aviation leaders Boeing and Lockheed were invited to study oblique wings to assess their benefits to commercial air travel. In 1979 the NASA Ames-Dryden-1 (AD-1), a subsonic, human piloted oblique wing aircraft began rigorous flight testing.\n\nNASA’s research efforts validated many of Jones’s theories, and the oblique wing demonstrated promise in real world flight. There were plans to follow the subsonic AD-1 program with a supersonic testing program using a modified U.S Navy F-8 fighter, but the program was cancelled early on in development. Budget constraints and shifting priorities have largely stalled intensive oblique wing research programs since the early 1990s. There are still widespread reservations about the flying qualities of highly asymmetrical aircraft. Flight control at extreme wing pivots is unfavorable and requires automated systems to augment flight control. Using modern flight control technologies and advanced materials, many of these drawbacks could be overcome. Oblique wings are still considered a viable concept for large transports and many are convinced that they will eventually be adopted. The advantages are simply too great to ignore. \n\nKey Research: “Thinking Obliquely: Robert T. Jones, the Oblique Wing, NASA’s AD-1 Demonstrator” by Bruce I.

            "description": "The one and only Nicki Minaj joins Ebro in the studio just days after the release of her record-breaking album, 'Pink Friday 2.'\n\nNicki shares a bit about what's been going on in her personal life since the release of her last album and how she balances being vulnerable with her fans while also protecting her privacy.

We also ask Jay Leno what his favorite type of racing is, his thoughts on electric motorcycles, his impression of the new, supercharged Kawasaki H2 and so much more from Jay Leno's Garage in Burbank, Ca. #motorcycle #motorcycles \nSubscribe to Cycledrag ► https://www.youtube.com/CycleDrag",

I had to do a bit of fiddling with the programming to get the timing right and I broke a few more things that what can be seen in the video but at least we have a clock that runs on time now.
