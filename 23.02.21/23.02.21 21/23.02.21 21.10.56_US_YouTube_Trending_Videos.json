This was super intense and really funny.\n\nthis is minecraft speedrunner vs hunter aka minecraft manhunt but theres a twist, it's not modded. I have a custom minecraft plugin that gave me OP kits with enchants. this is minecraft manhunt challenge popularized by dream, this is not a minecraft but challenge or a minecraft smp video. this is inspired by creators like bubbo, boosfer, yellowool, kier and dev, dream, and wilbur soot\n\nThumbnail still inspired by @Boosfer \nEdited by https://twitter.com/SquareAppleMC\n\n#Minecraft #MinecraftManhunt #Manhunt #Baablu",

This was super intense and really funny.\n\nthis is minecraft speedrunner vs hunter aka minecraft manhunt but theres a twist, it's not modded. I have a custom minecraft plugin that gave me OP kits with enchants. this is minecraft manhunt challenge popularized by dream, this is not a minecraft but challenge or a minecraft smp video. this is inspired by creators like bubbo, boosfer, yellowool, kier and dev, dream, and wilbur soot\n\nThumbnail still inspired by @Boosfer \nEdited by https://twitter.com/SquareAppleMC\n\n#Minecraft #MinecraftManhunt #Manhunt #Baablu"

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.

The 82-time winner on the PGA TOUR will be joined by all of the top 30 players in the FedExCup standings, as well as 23 of the top 25 players in the world. These include No. 1 Scottie Scheffler who returned to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking after winning by two shots at last week’s WM Phoenix Open and Rory McIlroy, who finished T10 at last year’s event. Local favorite and 2021 winner Max Homa is in action once again, as is two-time winner of the event Adam Scott. Viktor Hovland will head to Riviera full of confidence, having finished inside the top 5 his last two outings. Similarly, John Ram will be hoping to continue his exceptional run of form that has seen him win twice already on the PGA TOUR in 2023 at the Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. \r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/",

I absolutely love when NF drops some new music videos, because they always have little nuggets of information in them that I nerd out over. You see shoutouts to \"WHY\", \"LET YOU DOWN\", \"OUTCAST\", \"MANSION\", and several more NF songs.\n\nBECOME A CHANNEL MEMBER HERE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCpbrIr6hlIPd2EOTZxVBJw/join\n\n►Business Inquiries: cryptbusinessllc@gmail.com\n\n►Sports Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwX3_mpYFKOJREdnOHD16LQ\n\n►Podcast Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7sFMMoM89vgcgDOUG9XMxQ\n\n► Merch: https://www.crypttherapper.com/shop\n\n► Instagram: https://instagram.com/CryptTheRapper\n\n► Twitter: https://twitter.com/CryptTheRapper\n\n► Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1WIHbvNZTybCVHFMbzuGJo\n\n► Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/crypttherapperOG/\n\n► Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/crypt-226456644\n\nI'm a fat, white YouTube rapper and damn proud of it.

            "description": "Continuing the #Disney100 celebration with this new look at #TheLittleMermaid! Just 100 days until it arrives in theaters!\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton,” “Snowpiercer”) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca,” “Room”) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      \n\n“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton,” “In the Heights”), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”), who won two Oscars® for the music in the animated version of “The Little Mermaid,” with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (“Mary Poppins Returns,” “Into the Woods”). Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics are by Howard Ashman and new lyrics are by Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nFacebook: @DisneyTheLittleMermaid\nInstagram: @DisneyLittleMermaid\nTwitter: @LittleMermaid\nHashtag: #TheLittleMermaid",
