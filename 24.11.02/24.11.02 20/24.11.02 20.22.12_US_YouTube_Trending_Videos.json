            "description": "Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix brings back the CH2 Island, but reimagined with weekly POI and weapon drops inspired by some of the greatest music icons of all time.\n\nEach week one classic location of the Chapter 2 Remix map will be taken over by one of the four artists. In addition to the location change, each artist will also have a weapon themed to them. See the weekly breakdown:\n\nWeek 1 (starting November 2nd)\nThe Agency compound is now The Doggpound. The Doggfather will gift you Snoop’s Drum Gun Mythic if you can defeat him, and will join you as an ally!\n\nWeek 2 (starting November 7th)\nThe Grotto lair turns into Spaghetti Grotto. And if you can defeat Eminem, he’ll join your cause and bestow you with his RG Minigun. \n\nWeek 3 (starting November 14th)\nThe Shark is now dubbed Ice Isle with Ice Spice claiming dibs! Defeat Ice to add her to your team and get Ice Spice’s Grappler and Ice Spice’s Rifle Mythics!\n\nWeek 4 (starting November 21st)\nKeep an eye to the skies at the WRLD Point landmark arriving in Week 4.\n\nIn addition to the Remix aspect of weekly artist takeovers, you’ll notice that familiarity is also in the air. Favorite vehicles like Choppas and Motorboats return later in the season. Classic Chapter 2 weapons are also making an appearance as they unvault throughout the season. There’s also new vehicle features like the 1966 Cadillac DeVille which has hydraulics, bounces to music, and can jump in the air!\n\nFinally, with Chapter 2 Remix you’re getting an all-new Chapter 2 inspired Pass. This pass includes Outfits like: Chaos Director, 1-Ball, Undercover Skye, Meowdas, and Dynamo TNTina. Not to mention Kicks– a new cosmetic type that will be featured for the first time in the Remix Pass with a pair of Jordan’s. \n\nThrowback and look forward in Chapter 2 Remix.\n\n#FortniteChapter2Remix #Chapter2Remix #FortniteCh2Remix\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode. One giant map, A Battle Bus, Last one standing wins.

                "description": "Atlas is autonomously moving engine covers between supplier containers and a mobile sequencing dolly. The robot receives as input a list of bin locations to move parts between. \n\nAtlas uses a machine learning (ML) vision model to detect and localize the environment fixtures and individual bins [0:36]. The robot uses a specialized grasping policy and continuously estimates the state of manipulated objects to achieve the task.\n\nThere are no prescribed or teleoperated movements; all motions are generated autonomously online. The robot is able to detect and react to changes in the environment (e.g., moving fixtures) and action failures (e.g., failure to insert the cover, tripping, environment collisions [1:24]) using a combination of vision, force, and proprioceptive sensors."

You’ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.\n--\nDragon Age: The Veilguard is a collosal disappointment. It apes the most superficial elements of a Bioware game, making no effort to modernize what is a now fairly dated formula, while delivering absolutely none of writing, characterization, rpg depth and imagination that made previous Bioware games so great. \n\nVideo written and voiced by Ralph P\nEdited by Austin B. \n\n#DragonAge #Bioware #Review\n--\nThanks for taking the time to watch the video.

Just clamp down a straight board to use as a guide.\nAfter dry fitting the plywood, I could see there was a bulge on the side wall keeping the shelf from sliding all the way back.\nSo, I use my pencil like a scribe, now I can cut the plywood to fit the wall.\nI apply liquid nails to the frame and set the shelf down- fits like a glove.\nNext, I load 1 ¾” trim nails into my 15-gauge trim gun to shoot it down.\nI measure with a tape- making sure to hit the frame.\nWhen I cut the face board, I use a 2-degree bevel, this way it’s a little longer in the front than the back and makes it fit super snug (you can see here what a good fit I got).\nDon’t worry -The nail holes get filled before it’s painted.\nAt this point I was so tired I decided to take a nap.\nAnd then, the New Guy actually came out of his office to paint it for me.\nBe sure to like and follow (subscribe) for more content like this. @hausplans\n\n#build #howto #carpentry #framing #construction #diy #contractor #tools",

The Vanquish has seen several other changes over its previous iteration, including a new chassis with a longer wheelbase and a higher top speed of 344 kph (214 mph). But does it provide the driving experience you might expect of a full-fledged Aston Martin halo car? And with only a few choices for a new V12 on the market, how does it compare to its similarly-engined competitors? Thomas and James are excited to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

            "description": "The terrifying true scale of modern nuclear weapons is beyond what most people can imagine. Nuclear Weapons today are far more powerful than those used in World War II. For example, the B83 nuclear bomb, the largest in the U.S. arsenal, is 80 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This single Nuclear Weapon could destroy an entire city like Beijing, causing millions of deaths and injuries.\n\nSubmarine-launched missiles like the Trident II carry multiple Nuclear Weapons. Each missile can deliver up to eight warheads, each 30 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. A single Trident II could devastate a city like Moscow, resulting in over 2.8 million immediate fatalities.\n\nChina's Dongfeng 5 missile is another example of the terrifying power of Nuclear Weapons. It can carry up to 12 warheads, each 66 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. If aimed at a city like Washington, D.C., the impact would be catastrophic, with over a million fatalities.\n\nRussia's R-36 missile, known as the \"Satan\" missile, can carry multiple Nuclear Weapons with immense destructive power. Some versions can deliver a single warhead up to 20 megatons, which is over 1,300 times the Hiroshima bomb.\n\nAt the top of the list is Russia's RS-28 Sarmat missile, nicknamed \"Satan 2.\" This Nuclear Weapon can carry up to 15 warheads and potentially deliver a 50-megaton bomb, causing unimaginable destruction to cities like New York.\n\nEven though some countries may face setbacks, the existence of these Nuclear Weapons means that even a few could cause unimaginable damage. The true scale of modern Nuclear Weapons shows that in a nuclear war, there are no winners—only devastating loss for humanity.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/\nU.S. Department of Energy https://www.energy.gov/\nNational Museum of the U.S. Air Force https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon\n\n\nSubscribe to Science Time: https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24\n\n#nukes #sciencetime #nuclearwinter",

I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them \"MEmes.\" I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally.

            "description": "Stephen Thompson | October 25, 2024\nWhen Dua Lipa came to visit the Tiny Desk, she had nothing to prove — and much to live up to. After all, the singer’s Tiny Desk (home) concert, recorded in London in the aftermath of her 2020 blockbuster Future Nostalgia, still holds the record for the most-viewed Tiny Desk concert in history, her 130 million views surpassing even the likes of Mac Miller and Anderson .Paak. \n\nFour years later, the pop superstar finally graced the actual Tiny Desk, this time armed with four warm and inviting songs from Radical Optimism. Arriving in the first half of this year — when the dominant storylines in music so often revolved around grievances and rivalries — Radical Optimism stood out for its comparatively sunny and forgiving takes on failed and failing relationships, seduction, new love and old wounds. And, of course, it dispensed a world-beating banger in “Houdini,” which joins past Dua Lipa classics (“New Rules,” “Levitating,” “Don’t Start Now”) on her own personal Mount Rushmore.\n\nBefitting an artist whose newest songs often reflect the pursuit of personal growth — see: “Happy for You” — Lipa and her team breezed through the NPR Music offices with a mix of low-drama professionalism and unmistakable warmth. We’ve dealt with a lot of stars (and their teams) over the years, and as often as people ask us to dish about people who’ve been difficult, we’ve mostly accumulated stories of people who’ve been lovely to have around. Even among all those, Lipa and her people stood out: They were kind, gracious, fun and game.\n\nThat shows up on camera, too, as you’ll see here.
