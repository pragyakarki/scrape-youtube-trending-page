            "title": "Justin Timberlake: Tiny Desk Concert",
            "description": "Stephen Thompson | March 15, 2024\nWalking into the room shortly before Justin Timberlake took our cramped stage, I overheard someone on his team wondering aloud if this was to be the most densely populated Tiny Desk concert in history — which is to say, the most musicians we've ever fit in a single frame. It's not, but we don't often find a way to cram in this many human beings (15 in all) and this much gear.\n\nTimberlake has never been one to give partial effort, but this is a production befitting the occasion: namely, a set timed to drop concurrently with the release of his new album, Everything I Thought It Was. Eschewing the rootsier feel of its predecessor, 2018's Man of the Woods, the new record is a throwback, an epic and a blowout — and so's this lavish set, which scales the Timberlake experience down to 25 minutes of maximalist celebration and, when the moment calls for it, chiller vibes.\n\nBacked by his band The Tennessee Kids, Timberlake's Tiny Desk debut leans heavily on his early solo catalog, as he kicks it off with two songs from 2002's classic Justified and weaves in three more from 2006's magnificent FutureSex/LoveSounds — including a set-closing \"SexyBack,\" which finds the singer trotting out a megaphone in a truly meme-worthy moment.\n\nBy the way, in case you're wondering, the all-time record for musicians behind the Tiny Desk is a whopping 23, a feat pulled off by the fantastic Mucca Pazza in 2015. But Timberlake and company rival that classic performance's energy — in both cases, the real triumph lies not in the Tetris of it all, but in the way that many people still find ways to move, buoyantly and as one mighty organism.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Señorita\"\n\"Rock Your Body\"\n\"Pusher Love Girl\"\n\"Until The End Of Time\"\n\"Selfish\"\n\"What Goes Around\"\n\"SexyBack\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJustin Timberlake: lead vocals, guitar, keys\nRaVaughn Brown: vocals\nCamry: vocals\nErin Stevenson: vocals\nKenyon Dixon: vocals\nJustin Gilbert: keys\nMike Reid: drums\nElliot Ives: guitar\nDerrick Ray: bass\nLeon Silva: saxophone\nKevin Williams: trombone, flute\nDontae Winslow: trumpet\nSean Erick: trumpet\nAdam Blackstone: keys, percussion, music direction\nAndrew Hypes: DJ\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Alanté Serene, Elizabeth Gillis\nAudio Engineers: Kwesi Lee, Adam Blackstone, Danny Cheung\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#justintimberlake #nprmusic #tinydesk",

It's the idea of pure unadulterated freedom, living free from the shackles of responsibility, regulation, and reality. On a lone vessel dancing along the waves of a vast ocean, the world is truly your oyster, and the possibilities are endless! This swashbuckling fantasy has been fueled time and time again by classics like Pirates of the Caribbean in the early 2000s, Treasure Island in the late 1800s, and A General History of the Pyrates in the early 1700s. So considering how impactful the pirate genre has been on the greater populace, it might come as a shock to learn that our understanding of real pirate history is relatively meager. That last listed classic, A General History of the Pyrates by Captain Charles Johnson, remains one of our most primary sources for pirate history during the Golden Age, a novel which we know to have exaggerated and stretched the truth for sensational effect. While unfortunate, it does make sense that accurate recordings of the true history of piracy are scarce given the criminal and elusive nature of pirates themselves. One isn't really an efficient criminal by making their personal information as known as possible. Combine that with the fact that most pirates came from poverty and low social status, and the fact that many primary court documents have been lost to time, it makes sense that this history can be hard to accurately map and result in much speculation. In this video, much speculation must be made to connect the dots we have about Stede Bonnet's life for example. Naturally, this can lead to inaccurate assumptions, so with that in mind I tried my best to choose language carefully when telling this story. Take note of the numerous sentences initiated with, \"It's believed\" for some insight into when speculations are made. \n\nThe illusiveness of pirate history feeds into the fantasy. After all, these were criminals, and if we could go back in time and ask them, we'd find many of them wouldn't choose this way of life if given the choice. The story of piracy is the story of class struggle, with rare exceptions like Bonnet aside, the lowest rungs of society were the ones who populated the pirate ranks. Poor sailors who lost their livelihood, impressment victims seeking freedom, privateers losing their state-backed support, and those with nowhere to turn but the sea were the ones who became pirates. It's a position born out of struggle and poverty, the same struggle that can be seen with the Somali pirates in the modern day. In essence, they are no different than the glorified pirates of the Caribbean: disadvantaged victims of society merely doing what they can to survive. \n\nWorks Consulted / Read More: \n\n(Will add later)",

It was also a step forward for the space company making it a success, but far from a complete success as both booster and Starship failed to control themselves all the way to landing, and at least one on Orbit test - the engine relight failed.\nThe starship on orbit failed to maintain attitude during the initial reentry phase and this doomed the spacecraft to a fiery disintegration over the Indian Ocean.\nCongratulations to SpaceX on setting new records - let's get some soft landings next time.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley",

Ok well by brand new I really mean that I took an existingly great format cultivated by @dream  in minecraft and just hamfisted it into the skyrim together mod which has the netcode stability of crumbs.

However if any of the hunters manage to kill one another their score is locked and they must begin hunting down the other players! Whoever has defeated the most humans by the end of the time limit wins! However todays challenge is filled with twists, turns and crashes so who knows what wonderful skyrim multiplayer exploits will be discovered today!

The members of 311, who have been a band together for over 30 years, strolled into NPR HQ and barely needed much rehearsal time before playing four of their most beloved tracks. The band has been performing these songs for decades, and you can tell it all just comes naturally. \"This kind of reminds me of being in my dad's basement, being back next to the pool table, but it smells better here,\" said lead singer Nick Hexum, who felt right at home and back to his roots at our office space.\n\n311's self-titled album came out in 1995 when I was entering my peak angst stage. The songs on that album were the perfect soundtrack to all the pre-teen feelings I wasn't able to fully express myself. I also heavily related to what remains to be my favorite lyric of all time from the band's 1997 album Transistor: \"I do, I don't, whatever.\"\n\n311's Tiny Desk set started off with the song that lyric comes from, personal favorite \"Beautiful Disaster.\" The band continued with classic \"All Mixed Up\" before chilling out a bit with \"Amber.\" Then, as Hexum said before the band's final track, \"Down,\" it was \"back to the rock.\" Listen out for SA's changed lyric honoring my and Tiny Desk's shared hometown: \"Fall in love with your teachers, on the wax we are self made / Check the technique, 311 in D.C.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Beautiful Disaster\"\n\"All Mixed Up\"\n\"Amber\"\n\"Down\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNick Hexum: vocals, guitar\nTim Mahoney: guitar\nSA: turntables, vocals\nChad Sexton: drums\nP-Nut: bass\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer/Director: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nSeries Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Michael Zamora\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#311 #nprmusic #tinydesk",

            "description": "In the third round of the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard, Rory McIlroy lets one loose, sending his tee shot 365 yards, cutting the corner and landing his ball on the green at the par-4 10th hole, becoming the first player in the ShotLink era (2003) to drive the 10th green at Bay Hill. He would two-putt for birdie.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PGA TOUR’s Florida swing continues as Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club & Lodge hosts the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard. This event is the second of three player-hosted invitationals (along with Tiger Woods’ The Genesis Invitational and Jack Nicklaus’ the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday). ­World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will be in the field this week. The American has gone T4-1-T15 in his last three Arnold Palmer Invitational starts and hasn’t finished worse than T17 in his last five TOUR starts – including three straight top-10s. Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up in Florida this week. He’s had past success here claiming victory in 2018 and finishing runner-up two years ago.

                "description": "In the third round of the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard, Rory McIlroy lets one loose, sending his tee shot 365 yards, cutting the corner and landing his ball on the green at the par-4 10th hole, becoming the first player in the ShotLink era (2003) to drive the 10th green at Bay Hill. He would two-putt for birdie.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PGA TOUR’s Florida swing continues as Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club & Lodge hosts the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard. This event is the second of three player-hosted invitationals (along with Tiger Woods’ The Genesis Invitational and Jack Nicklaus’ the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday). ­World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will be in the field this week. The American has gone T4-1-T15 in his last three Arnold Palmer Invitational starts and hasn’t finished worse than T17 in his last five TOUR starts – including three straight top-10s. Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up in Florida this week. He’s had past success here claiming victory in 2018 and finishing runner-up two years ago. The Northern Irishman has also made nine out of nine cuts and claimed six top-10s previously in this event. Reigning FedExCup champion Viktor Hovland is also back in action this week. Hovland last teed it up at The Genesis Invitational where he finished tied for 19th. He has recorded back-to-back top-10 results at Bay Hill, including a runner-up in 2022.

According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” said Mann. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, “Inside Out 2” releases only in theaters Summer 2024.",

From executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the creators of Westworld, starring Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Walton Goggins and more.

                "description": "Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have. 200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind — and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them. From executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the creators of Westworld, starring Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Walton Goggins and more. All episodes arrive April 11 on Prime Video.\n \n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now? We've got it.

I really want to go home\nAnd all these beautiful people are making me feel like a fugly little gnome\n\nDanny: I feel the same way\nTom: Really?\nDanny: Yeah, I hate parties\nTom: I hate them too\nMichelle: Play some music!\nTom: Oy, I’m not the goddamn DJ, Michelle! I told you, I got my face stuck in this big bear head and you and your friends just started dancing around me\nDanny: Oh my god, I hate it when that happens\nTom: It happens to me almost \nDanny & Tom: Every day\nTom: Dude do you want to hang out?\nDanny: We could, or…we could \nDanny & Tom: Stand at opposite ends of this party stare at our phones for half an hour and then never talk to each other again\nMichelle: Play Lady Gaga!\nTom: WE’RE HAVING A MOMENT\nDanny: MICHELLE, YOU’RE KILLING ME!\n\nTom: Oh my God, another chorus!\nPartygoers: LET’S BREAK STUFF!\nDanny: I’m freaking out\nPartygoer: Is that Dr. Who?\nTom: This door doesn’t open!\nMichelle: Oh my god I’m SO drunk right now\nDanny: Oh, thank god, a cat.

I really want to go home\nAnd all these beautiful people are making me feel like a fugly little gnome\n\nDanny: I feel the same way\nTom: Really?\nDanny: Yeah, I hate parties\nTom: I hate them too\nMichelle: Play some music!\nTom: Oy, I’m not the goddamn DJ, Michelle! I told you, I got my face stuck in this big bear head and you and your friends just started dancing around me\nDanny: Oh my god, I hate it when that happens\nTom: It happens to me almost \nDanny & Tom: Every day\nTom: Dude do you want to hang out?\nDanny: We could, or…we could \nDanny & Tom: Stand at opposite ends of this party stare at our phones for half an hour and then never talk to each other again\nMichelle: Play Lady Gaga!\nTom: WE’RE HAVING A MOMENT\nDanny: MICHELLE, YOU’RE KILLING ME!\n\nTom: Oh my God, another chorus!\nPartygoers: LET’S BREAK STUFF!\nDanny: I’m freaking out\nPartygoer: Is that Dr. Who?\nTom: This door doesn’t open!\nMichelle: Oh my god I’m SO drunk right now\nDanny: Oh, thank god, a cat.

                "description": "You might remember the legendary song and meme sensation that was crab rave. Well imagine if the creator of that song became a game dev and made a video game where you Claw your way across exotic islands combining fluid movement with fast paced combat to become a Crab Champion in this third person shooter with roguelike elements. Ok you don't need to imagine the game is here and its called Crab Champions. However this is a special game. Unlike most games the developer of this one really wants you to actually break their game. This game wants to be broken. So what makes crab champions so special. This game features stats and skills that can be stacked and modified in a way that lets the player manipulate the gameplay to exploit, glitch and bug your way to becoming overpowered. In this video I will showcase a god mode immortality glitch, an infinite money glitch and an infinite damage glitch. All that and more because this game is oh so perfect for an exploiter like The Spiffing Brit! \n\nYou can currently grab Crab Champions On a steam sale here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/774801/Crab_Champions/\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:46 - Starting our run\n04:15 - Exploiting the shops!\n06:06 - Science with Spiff!\n08:06 - Improving our luck even further\n11:12 - The final biome!\n14:45 - Defeat the boss!\n16:38 - Machine gun crab\n21:29 - Science with Spiff S01E02\n23:43 - The return of King Skull!\n24:19 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.
