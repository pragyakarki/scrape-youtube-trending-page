Her aunt keeps her around because she has a share in the family's property.\nSalar, the son of a wealthy businessman, is passionate about photography, which often earns him criticism from his family. With a pure heart, Salar is known for evading his responsibilities.\nAt her cousin's wedding, Sitara wrongly assumes Salar is the photographer.

Salar, once again, avoids the issue, leaving Sitara to face doubts from her own family.\nCan Sitara prove she’s not guilty? Will Salar help her avoid further mistreatment? Will her family support Sitara? Can Salar show he genuinely cares?

Spread the word.\n\nKaffara Episode 38 - [Eng Sub] - Ali Ansari - Laiba Khan - Zoya Nasir - 3rd September - HAR PAL GEO\n\nSitara, a lively orphan living with her brother, aunt, and uncle, finds joy in life's small things despite her aunt's poor treatment. Her aunt keeps her around because she has a share in the family's property.\nSalar, the son of a wealthy businessman, is passionate about photography, which often earns him criticism from his family. With a pure heart, Salar is known for evading his responsibilities.\nAt her cousin's wedding, Sitara wrongly assumes Salar is the photographer. Salar develops a soft spot for Sitara after seeing how poorly she is treated. However, due to a conspiracy, objections arise about their closeness. Salar, once again, avoids the issue, leaving Sitara to face doubts from her own family.\nCan Sitara prove she’s not guilty? Will Salar help her avoid further mistreatment? Will her family support Sitara? Can Salar show he genuinely cares? Will there be more plots against Sitara?\n\n7th Sky Entertainment Presentation \nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi \nDirector: Muhammad Iftikhar Iffi\nWriter: Shafia Khan\n\nCast :\nAli Ansari as Salar\nLaiba Khan as Sitara\nZoya Nasir as Nimi \nAliya Ali as Saba\nYasir Shoro as Salman\nJunaid Akhtar as Ehtisham\nFawad Jalal as Junaid\nRaeed Muhammad Alam as Qasim\nZohreh Amir as Zoya\nSadaf Aashan as Shahida\nRashid Farooqui as Shaukat\nBakhtawar Khan as Sahiba\nAnnie Zaidi as Mehreen\nUsman Peerzada as Tahir\nReham Rafiq as Kiran\nNazlee Nasr as Najma\nMohsin Gillani as Mirza Sahab\nShaheen Khan as Suraiya\nSami Khan as Zohaib\nSajida Syed as Zaira\nFareeha Jabeen as Khala Bi\nShabana Shaikh as Zehra\n\n#kaffara \n#laibakhan \n#aliansari"

We also indulged in a delicious homemade Maharashtrian feast featuring 7-step Misal, Kothimbir Vadi, Piyush, Shakarpare, Besan Ladoo, and more—bringing the true essence of a Marathi Mulgi to life.\n\nThe fun continued with a quirky game where I used the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 360's Multi Control Feature to drag emojis onto the screen. The twist? Sharvari had to deliver famous Bollywood dialogues based on the emojis—in Marathi! And we topped it off with a thrilling fan interaction call.\n\nSharvari’s love for Maharashtrian food proves she’s a typical Marathi Mulgi through and through.

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu.

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nNitish Bhaluni / Raj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nSachin Shroff / Shailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nNidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder Suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak / Kiran Bhatt as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nNavina Wadekar / Monika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia"
