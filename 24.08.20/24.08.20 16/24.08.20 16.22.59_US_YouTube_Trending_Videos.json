But this Deadpool doesn't have the charm of Ryan Reynolds. \n\nThe only thing this guy has in common with the Marvel hero its that he also leaves death and destruction wherever he goes. And he's about to realize, the hard way, that he is the villain of this story. Not the superhero.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n00:00 - INTRO\n04:55 - GOOD KID GONE BAD\n--\n09:10 - A RELATIONSHIP & RED FLAGS\n12:45 - A TERRIFYING TURN\n14:36 - USELESS!!!\n16:03 - THE BEHAVIOR CONTINUES\n19:05 - ESCALATING VIOLENCE\n22:32 - WADE'S BREAKDOWN\n26:57 - THE CHARGES\n29:19 - WADE'S TRIAL\n31:25 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  : \n\nFACE\n\n-Make Up Forever HD Skin Foundation “1Y16”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY21gAGTS\n\n-Benefit Dew-La-La “Luna”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY4XfPg5x\n\n-Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer “Madeleine”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY5HlMdKW\n\n-Estee Lauder Double Wear Maximum Cover “1N3 Creamy Vanilla”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY8J1ShTz\n\n-Laura Mercier Loose Setting Powder “Translucent”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTY9SNu7t0\n\n-Nars Bronzing Powder “Laguna”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZakcGT3b\n\n-Haus Labs Color Fuse Glassy Blush Balm “Glassy Rosette”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZaQPktFj\n\n-Wet n Wild Color Icon Blush “Pinch Me Pink”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZbM6PlFJ\n\n-Em Cosmetics Heavens Glow “Magic Hour”\nhttps://bit.ly/4diJ9Sx\n\nEYES\n\n-Rare Beauty Eyeshadow Primer\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZipwRovd\n\n-Melt Cosmetics Metal Bond Gel Liner “Penny”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZjjg7BfT\n\n-Vieve The Essential Palette\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZkiRDrpb\n\n-Tarte Waterproof Mascara “Maneater”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZlMax1ML\n\nLIPS\n\n-MAC Pro Longwear Lip Pencil “In Control”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZo2r91lA (this color may be discontinued)\n\n-Too Faced Hangover Pillow Balm “Cocoa Kiss”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZrmw0Lsk\n\n\nBROWS\n\n-Jecca Blac Brow Gel\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZt4DQXap\n\n-Make Up For Ever Aqua Resist Brow Pencil “Medium Brown”\nhttps://howl.me/cmTZuHcxS1O"

Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal.\n\nAutomate the processing of abstract geometric shapes into more complex ones by cutting, rotating, stacking, painting and more. Deliver distinct shapes to unlock new technologies and expand your factory’s capabilities. Learn, improve, rebuild and solve logistical challenges to design the most efficient shape production lines.\n\nBuild in multiple interconnected layers, allowing you to compact and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension. Improve your designs to get the most benefit out of every space platform built and massively increase your production throughput.\n\nShapez 2 is the purest factory building game imaginable - all buildings are free, resources never run out and there are no enemies or time limits. Prepare for a 100% factory-building experience: effortlessly delete, redesign and rebuild as much as you want, with no penalties, at your own pace.\n\nYou’re always in complete control - whether the messy spaghetti belts you built 4 hours ago could use some improvements or a whole circle factory needs to go, Shapez 2 gives you the tools to do it without limitations.\n\nStart your operation from a single asteroid and continuously expand by building new platforms. Unlock new layouts as you progress, and grow from a single belt into a massive multi-station space factory connected by space trains. Design modular blueprintable platforms to build on a massive scale, placing hundreds of buildings with just one click.\n\nPerformance is very important to us, and with the complete rewrite of Shapez 2 in a new engine, we're doing our best to make sure that massive factories run smoothly - even with the all-new 3D visuals!\n\nMulti-Layer 3D Factories: Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension\nTrains: Connect distant stations with a network of space trains\nResearch System: Unlock buildings, mechanics & upgrades in the all-new tech tree\nNew Shape Mechanics: Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic\nGame Modes: 4 game modes, including a hexagonal shape mode\nBlueprint Library: Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone\nAll-new Visuals: Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment\nFluids: Use different types of liquids to process shapes\nAnimated Open Buildings: See exactly what's happening inside buildings in your factory\nUndo/Redo: Up to 50 undo/redo operations",

How did Lego go from a children's toy to a collector's item?

                "description": "Lego is the world's largest toy company but it's gained a reputation for being an expensive hobby. Since 2007, Lego has released dozens of sets that cost over $300. The most expensive Star Wars sets cost $850. And prices for vintage Lego sets can reach over $1,000. These high prices have caught the attention of thieves, who in some cases have stolen about $300,000 worth of Lego. So, how did we get here? How did Lego go from a children's toy to a collector's item? And why is it so expensive?\n\nMORE SO EXPENSIVE VIDEOS:\nWhy Hagoromo Chalk Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/BORVxbsdkCM?feature=shared\nWhy Michelin-Starred Chefs Are Paying Premium For One Of Korea's Rarest Seaweeds | So Expensive\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSEOfPg0Ki4&t=0s\nWhy India's $12 Million Cricket Bat Industry Is Fueled By UK Trees | So Expensive | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5k2ewUwInc&t=0s\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:12 - Lego's Rise\n02:39 - The Lego System\n05:39 - Lego's Fall\n07:39 - Adult Fans Of Lego\n13:07 - Conventions\n14:32 - Lego Resale Market\n17:34 - Lego's Rise (Again)\n19:37 - Products For Kids And Adults\n22:54 - Why Lego Is So Expensive\n25:51 - Will Lego's Success Last?\n28:04 - Credits\n\nWhy Lego Is So Expensive | So Expensive | Business Insider\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#lego #toys #businessinsider \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nBusiness Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider Business Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness Business Insider on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider \nBusiness Insider on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBusiness Insider on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider"

Dillon and the No. 3 team also were docked 25 points in both the drivers’ and owners’ standings.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. also responds to the three-week suspension handed to Dillon’s spotter, Brandon Benesch, and Joey Logano’s $50,000 fine for spinning his tires on pit road after the race.\n\nLeave your thoughts in the comments below. \n\nFollow Dirty Mo Media's social channels for more on this news.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DirtyMoMedia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DirtyMoMedia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dirtymomedia\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dirtymomedia_\n\nAll About Dirty Mo Media: https://www.dirtymomedia.com",

                "description": "Dale Earnhardt Jr. gives instant reaction to NASCAR’s seismic announcement that Austin Dillon will keep his victory at Richmond Raceway on Sunday, Aug. 11, 2024, but lose playoff eligibility due to the encumbered nature of the win. Dillon and the No. 3 team also were docked 25 points in both the drivers’ and owners’ standings.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. also responds to the three-week suspension handed to Dillon’s spotter, Brandon Benesch, and Joey Logano’s $50,000 fine for spinning his tires on pit road after the race.\n\nLeave your thoughts in the comments below. \n\nFollow Dirty Mo Media's social channels for more on this news.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DirtyMoMedia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DirtyMoMedia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dirtymomedia\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dirtymomedia_\n\nAll About Dirty Mo Media: https://www.dirtymomedia.com"
