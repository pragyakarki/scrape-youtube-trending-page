ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

Share your creation to the Gallery for other Simmers to download and us for their own Getaways!\n\nLive a more adventurous life with new skills: Entomology, Diving, Archery and Papercrafts. Make classic crafts like paper planes, catch and raise butterflies, make a splash with new diving boards, and hit the bullseye! These activities are for both kids and grown-ups, as are the Diving Board, Waterslide, and Kayak. Get out there and explore the water! Active Adult Sims will enjoy working out with Spin Bikes and Free Weights, and everyone will enjoy drinking a refreshing smoothie from the new Blender.\n\nChildhood is an especially adventurous time. Customize Modular Playgrounds with slides and different platforms for a ton of Childhood fun. Kids can challenge each other with games like Hide and Seek or Rock, Paper, Scissors, and even have Imaginary Friends! Choose from four different Imaginary Friend dolls and four different personalities: Goofball, Competitive, Creative, and Evil.\n\nAvailable October 2 at 10AM PT on EA App PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation®4, and PlayStation®5.

The music stands alone on a foundation anchored by his impressive sonic proficiency (across drums, bass, keys, and guitar) and airtight arena-size hooks with unforgettable vocals. He harbors an irresistible signature sound, inventive vision, and incomparable identity vaunted by a fervent global fanbase. For as unique as the music is, his story so far proves to be just as unprecedented. This is arguably the first hard rock act to genuinely break out from ground zero in the 2020’s, generating north of 100 million streams, toppling charts, and selling out headline tours less than five years since its debut. Back in 2021, Mammoth’s first offering, Mammoth WVH, took flight, bowing at #12 on the Billboard 200 and capturing #1 on three Billboard charts—Top Hard Rock Albums, Top Independent Albums, and Top Rock Albums. “Distance” soared as the first of two #1 Rock Radio Hits and earned a GRAMMY® Award nomination for “Best Rock Song.” Two years later, Mammoth II only saw him pick up the pace. It debuted in the Top 5 of the Billboard Top Album Sales Chart in addition to bringing him back to #1 on the Top Hard Rock Albums Chart. It incited widespread applause from Rolling Stone, Guitar World, GRAMMY.com, Classic Rock, American Songwriter, and KERRANG! The band canvased the globe with Metallica and Pantera and supported Foo Fighters in North America as well as filling houses on their own. They performed on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!, at MusiCares 2024 gala in honor of Jon Bon Jovi, and Wolf took the stage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame® Induction of Ozzy Osbourne. Now, Wolfgang pushes forward on Mammoth’s third full-length LP.\n\nConnect with Mammoth at:\nWebsite: www.mammoth.band\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MammothWVH\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mammothwvh/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MammothWVH\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@Mammoth\n\n#Mammoth #WVH #MammothWVH #wolfgangvanhalen",

This is the Official Indiegogo Trailer for Spider-Man: Alone.\n\n​This is more than a fan film; it’s a deeply personal, character-driven series about the cost of becoming a hero. Inspired by a real-life battle with childhood cancer and a lifelong love for the character, our story plunges into the raw, often isolating, earliest days of a street-level Spider-Man. It's a modern reimagining of Amazing Fantasy #15 that asks: What does it take to be a hero?\n\n​Every dollar pledged on our Indiegogo campaign is a vote of confidence, allowing our incredible team of artists to bring this cinematic vision to life.

John Legend\n\n[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]\nI found myself dreamin' in silver and gold\nLike a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows\nWe were walkin' on moonlight and you pulled me close\nSplit second and you disappeared and then I was all alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Meghan Trainor]\nI woke up in tears, with you by my side\nA breath of relief, and I've realised\nNo, we're not promised tomorrow\n\n[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standin', I won't take you for granted\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)\nI'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\n[Verse 2: John Legend, Meghan Trainor]\nIn the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke\nYou could lose everything, the truth is you never know\nSo I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey), any chance that I get\nI'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret\n\n[Pre-Chorus: John Legend, Meghan Trainor, Both]\nLet's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want)\nUse what we got before it's all gone (All gone)\n'Cause no (No), we're not promised tomorrow\n\n[Chorus: Meghan Trainor, John Legend, Both]\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)\nI'm gonna hold you (Hey), like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standin' (Yeah), I won't take you for granted\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you), like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)\nI'm gonna love you (Love you), like I'm gonna lose you (Hey)\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus: Meghan Trainor, John Legend, Both]\nI'm gonna love you (Oh) like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)\nI'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standin', I won't take you for granted\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you, baby) like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)\nI'm gonna love you (Oh) like I'm gonna lose you\n\n📧 Contact: mgmt.moonshine@gmail.com\n\n#meghantrainor  #likeimgonnaloseyou  #lyrics #johnlegend"

            "description": "Baylen Dupree is back for an all-new season of 'Baylen Out Loud,' premiering on Tuesday, Oct. 7 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on TLC. Season 2 sees Baylen, who lives with Tourette Syndrome, adjust to a more adult home life, now that she's living with fiancé Colin. From pre-marital counseling sessions to cozy apartment life, this season is all about Baylen leveling up. As she adjusts to a new city, she begins building new friendships and expanding her support system. Baylen’s journey with Tourette Syndrome continues as she navigates new challenges, medications and opportunities to learn more about herself. With a wedding on the horizon, Baylen and Colin begin laying the groundwork for their big day, preparing what’s to come through dress shopping, floral design and venue visits, as they take meaningful steps toward building a life together. But wedding planning isn’t as dreamy as they imagined as they are faced with personal compromise, budget realities and location dilemmas that challenge their vision and test their teamwork.",

Combat is slicker than ever thanks to exciting new movement options and some interesting enemy designs, and the entertaining story takes things in a fresh direction while still tying neatly into existing lore. The transition to an open world isn’t the smoothest, especially when troubling terrain with a few too many invisible walls can make it feel like these environments are all for show, but that’s more than worth putting up with in exchange for being able to chart your own path and freely explore the wacky, violent world of Kairos. The bugs my crew and I encountered were bad enough to occasionally sour our co-op groove, but in between them we had a great time, and my friends and I have found ourselves utterly at the mercy of its loot grind. The Borderlands series feels like it has been a bit stuck in the mud for some time now, and especially after a few patches, Borderlands 4 is exactly the kick in the pants it has needed.\""

            "description": "I’m giving away $50,000 you DON’T want to miss it!: http://codebrettski.com \n\nWe are BACK at the Casino… Playing a BRAND NEW slot machine! Let's see how this plays out, I'm expecting AT LEAST 3 hand-pays... if not 7. Thank you all so much for liking, subscribing, and dropping your thoughts in the comments. Even if you’re roasting me—I still love you. You’re all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war.    \n\nBrettski strode into the Neon Mirage Casino like a man with a mission—and $10,000 burning a hole in his pocket. The air buzzed with anticipation, lights flashing like sirens of fate. He wasn’t here for poker or roulette. No, tonight, he had eyes for one machine only: The Billionaire's Bounty, a brand-new slot machine rumored to have a glitch... one that could spill out the $1 billion jackpot.\n\nHe found it in the far corner, half-shrouded in shadow. No line, no fanfare—just a flickering screen and a strange hum, like it knew he was coming.\n\nBrettski sat, fed in a crisp hundred, and pulled the lever.\n\nSpin one: Cherry. Bar. Skull.\nSpin two: Bar. Cherry. Skull.\nSpin three: Skull. Skull. Skull.\n\nThe screen glitched—briefly flashing binary code—before returning to normal. The payout? $0.\n\nHe laughed it off, but noticed something weird: his watch was ticking backwards.\n\nHe kept playing. $100 after $100. Time itself seemed to blur—people moved slower, drinks stayed full, the air thicker. On spin 49, he hit three diamonds. The machine moaned and shot out a gold token.\n\n“Insert to unlock Phase Two,” the screen whispered.\n\nHe hesitated. Then inserted it.\n\nSuddenly, the machine split open, revealing a second screen… one that looked more like a satellite interface than a game. Coordinates flashed. Symbols in a language he didn’t recognize scrolled rapidly.\n\nSecurity began approaching. Red lights flared. The machine spoke again:\n\n“Jackpot authentication required. Place palm on scanner.”\n\nBrettski reached out—then stopped. His palm had a strange mark, glowing faintly.\n\nAnd then the casino floor began to rumble.\n\nThe screen flickered one final message:\n\n“Only one player may claim the throne.”\n\nAnd the floor gave out beneath him.\n\nTo be continued.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination.",

No, tonight, he had eyes for one machine only: The Billionaire's Bounty, a brand-new slot machine rumored to have a glitch... one that could spill out the $1 billion jackpot.\n\nHe found it in the far corner, half-shrouded in shadow. No line, no fanfare—just a flickering screen and a strange hum, like it knew he was coming.\n\nBrettski sat, fed in a crisp hundred, and pulled the lever.\n\nSpin one: Cherry. Bar. Skull.\nSpin two: Bar. Cherry. Skull.\nSpin three: Skull. Skull. Skull.\n\nThe screen glitched—briefly flashing binary code—before returning to normal. The payout? $0.\n\nHe laughed it off, but noticed something weird: his watch was ticking backwards.\n\nHe kept playing. $100 after $100. Time itself seemed to blur—people moved slower, drinks stayed full, the air thicker. On spin 49, he hit three diamonds. The machine moaned and shot out a gold token.\n\n“Insert to unlock Phase Two,” the screen whispered.\n\nHe hesitated. Then inserted it.\n\nSuddenly, the machine split open, revealing a second screen… one that looked more like a satellite interface than a game. Coordinates flashed. Symbols in a language he didn’t recognize scrolled rapidly.\n\nSecurity began approaching. Red lights flared. The machine spoke again:\n\n“Jackpot authentication required. Place palm on scanner.”\n\nBrettski reached out—then stopped. His palm had a strange mark, glowing faintly.\n\nAnd then the casino floor began to rumble.\n\nThe screen flickered one final message:\n\n“Only one player may claim the throne.”\n\nAnd the floor gave out beneath him.\n\nTo be continued.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski?

L'aria vibrava di attesa, le luci lampeggiavano come sirene del destino. Non era lì per il poker o la roulette. No, quella sera aveva occhi solo per una macchina: The Billionaire's Bounty, una nuovissima slot machine che si diceva avesse un problema tecnico... un problema che avrebbe potuto far uscire il jackpot da un miliardo di dollari.\n\nLa trovò nell'angolo più lontano, semi-nascosta nell'ombra. Nessuna coda, nessuna fanfara: solo uno schermo tremolante e uno strano ronzio, come se sapesse che stava arrivando.\n\nBrettski si sedette, inseriva un centinaio di dollari e tirava la leva.\n\nPrimo giro: Ciliegia. Bar. Teschio.\nSecondo giro: Bar. Ciliegia. Teschio.\nTerzo giro: Teschio. Teschio. Teschio.\n\nLo schermo si bloccò, mostrando brevemente un codice binario, prima di tornare alla normalità. La vincita? 0 dollari.\n\nCi rise sopra, ma notò qualcosa di strano: il suo orologio stava ticchettando all'indietro.\n\nContinuò a giocare. 100 dollari dopo 100 dollari. Il tempo stesso sembrava annebbiarsi: le persone si muovevano più lentamente, i drink rimanevano pieni, l'aria più densa. Al giro 49, trovò tre diamanti. La macchina gemette e sparò un gettone d'oro.\n\n\"Inserisci per sbloccare la Fase Due\", sussurrò lo schermo.\n\nEsitò. Poi lo inserì.\n\nImprovvisamente, la macchina si aprì, rivelando un secondo schermo... uno che sembrava più un'interfaccia satellitare che un gioco. Le coordinate lampeggiarono. Simboli in una lingua che non riconosceva scorrevano rapidamente.\n\nLa sicurezza iniziò ad avvicinarsi. Luci rosse si accesero. La macchina parlò di nuovo:\n\n\"Autenticazione Jackpot richiesta. Posizionare il palmo sullo scanner.\"\n\nBrettski allungò la mano, poi si fermò. Il suo palmo aveva uno strano segno, che brillava debolmente.\n\nE poi il pavimento del casinò iniziò a rimbombare.\n\nLo schermo lampeggiò un ultimo messaggio:\n\n\"Solo un giocatore può reclamare il trono.\"\n\nE il pavimento cedette sotto di lui.\n\nContinua.\n\n#slot #blackjack #gioco d'azzardo #casinò #baccarat #roulette\n\nChi è Brettski?

El aire vibraba de anticipación, las luces destellaban como sirenas del destino. No había venido para jugar al póker ni a la ruleta. No, esta noche, solo tenía los ojos puestos en una máquina: La Recompensa del Multimillonario, una tragamonedas flamante de la que se rumoreaba que tenía un fallo... uno que podría desembolsar el premio mayor de mil millones de dólares.\n\nLa encontró en el rincón más alejado, medio envuelta en sombras. Sin cola, sin fanfarria, solo una pantalla parpadeante y un zumbido extraño, como si supiera que venía.\n\nBrettski se sentó, metió cien billetes y tiró de la palanca.\n\nGiro uno: Cereza. Barra. Calavera.\nGiro dos: Barra. Cereza. Calavera.\nGiro tres: Calavera. Calavera. Calavera.\n\nLa pantalla falló —parpadeando brevemente un código binario— antes de volver a la normalidad. ¿El premio? Cero dólares.\n\nSe rió, pero notó algo extraño: su reloj iba al revés.\n\nSiguió jugando. Cien dólares tras cien dólares. El tiempo mismo parecía difuminarse: la gente se movía más despacio, las bebidas seguían llenas, el aire se espesaba. En el giro 49, sacó tres diamantes. La máquina gimió y disparó una ficha dorada.\n\n\"Inserta para desbloquear la Fase Dos\", susurró la pantalla.\n\nDudó. Luego la insertó.\n\nDe repente, la máquina se abrió, revelando una segunda pantalla… una que parecía más una interfaz de satélite que un juego. Las coordenadas parpadearon. Símbolos en un idioma que no reconocía se desplazaban rápidamente.\n\nEl personal de seguridad comenzó a acercarse. Las luces rojas se encendieron.

Nie przyszedł tu po pokera ani ruletkę. Nie, dziś wieczorem miał oko tylko na jedną maszynę: The Billionaire's Bounty, zupełnie nowy automat do gry, o którym plotkowano, że ma usterkę... taką, która może wysypać jackpota wartego miliard dolarów.\n\nZnalazł go w odległym kącie, na wpół spowity cieniem.

Potem włożył żeton.\n\nNagle maszyna otworzyła się, odsłaniając drugi ekran… wyglądający bardziej jak interfejs satelitarny niż gra. Współrzędne zamigotały. Symbole w języku, którego nie znał, przewijały się szybko.\n\nOchrona zaczęła się zbliżać. Zapaliły się czerwone światła. Maszyna odezwała się ponownie:\n\n„Wymagane uwierzytelnienie jackpota. Przyłóż dłoń do skanera”.\n\nBrettski wyciągnął rękę – i znieruchomiał. Na jego dłoni był dziwny znak, słabo świecący.\n\nA potem podłoga kasyna zaczęła drżeć.\n\nNa ekranie pojawił się ostatni komunikat:\n\n„Tylko jeden gracz może zasiąść na tronie”.\n\nA podłoga pod nim zadrżała.\n\nCiąg dalszy nastąpi.\n\n#sloty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski?

Laten we eens kijken hoe dit afloopt, ik verwacht MINSTENS 3 uitbetalingen... zo niet 7. Heel erg bedankt allemaal voor het liken, abonneren en het achterlaten van jullie reacties. Zelfs als jullie me belachelijk maken, hou ik nog steeds van jullie. Jullie zijn allemaal prachtig, en ik waardeer het enorm dat jullie allemaal mee hebben gereisd op deze gekke reis. Wens me succes en ik zie jullie bij de volgende! Laten we ten strijde trekken.\n\nBrettski liep het Neon Mirage Casino binnen als een man met een missie – en $ 10.000 brandde als een gat in zijn zak. De lucht gonsde van verwachting, de lichten flitsten als sirenes van het lot. Hij was hier niet voor poker of roulette. Nee, vanavond had hij maar één machine op het oog: The Billionaire's Bounty, een gloednieuwe gokkast waarvan het gerucht ging dat er een storing in zat... eentje die de jackpot van $1 miljard zou kunnen laten vallen.\n\nHij vond hem in de verre hoek, half gehuld in schaduw. Geen rij, geen ophef – alleen een flikkerend scherm en een vreemd gezoem, alsof hij wist dat hij eraan kwam.\n\nBrettski ging zitten, gaf een kraakheldere honderd in en trok aan de hendel.\n\nDraai één: Kers. Bar. Schedel.\nDraai twee: Bar. Kers. Schedel.\nDraai drie: Schedel. Schedel. Schedel.\n\nHet scherm haperde – er flitste even een binaire code – voordat het weer normaal werd. De uitbetaling? $0.\n\nHij lachte erom, maar merkte iets vreemds op: zijn horloge tikte achteruit.\n\nHij bleef spelen. $100 na $100. De tijd zelf leek te vervagen – mensen bewogen langzamer, de drankjes bleven vol, de lucht werd dikker. Bij spin 49 kreeg hij drie ruiten. De machine kreunde en schoot een gouden fiche uit.\n\n\"Invoeren om Fase Twee te ontgrendelen,\" fluisterde het scherm.\n\nHij aarzelde. Toen voerde hij het in.\n\nPlotseling spleet de machine open en verscheen een tweede scherm... een dat meer op een satellietinterface leek dan op een spel. Coördinaten flitsten. Symbolen in een taal die hij niet herkende, scrolden snel.\n\nDe beveiliging kwam dichterbij. Rode lampjes flitsten. De machine sprak opnieuw:\n\n\"Jackpot-authenticatie vereist. Plaats uw handpalm op de scanner.\"\n\nBrettski stak zijn hand uit en stopte toen. Zijn handpalm vertoonde een vreemd teken, dat zwak oplichtte.\n\nEn toen begon de casinovloer te rommelen.\n\nHet scherm flikkerde een laatste bericht:\n\n\"Slechts één speler mag de troon opeisen.\"\n\nEn de vloer begaf het onder hem.\n\nWordt vervolgd.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski?

Die Luft summte vor Vorfreude, Lichter blinkten wie Sirenen des Schicksals. Er war nicht zum Pokern oder Roulette hier. Nein, heute Abend hatte er nur ein Auge auf einen einzigen Automaten geworfen: The Billionaire's Bounty, einen brandneuen Spielautomaten, dem Gerüchten zufolge ein Fehler auftrat ... einer, der den 1-Milliarden-Dollar-Jackpot ausschütten könnte.\n\nEr fand ihn in der hintersten Ecke, halb im Schatten. Keine Schlange, kein Getöse – nur ein flackernder Bildschirm und ein seltsames Summen, als hätte er gewusst, dass er kam.\n\nBrettski setzte sich, warf einen frischen Hunderter ein und zog den Hebel.\n\nDrehung eins: Kirsche. Bar. Totenkopf.\nDrehung zwei: Bar. Kirsche. Totenkopf.\nDrehung drei: Totenkopf. Totenkopf. Totenkopf.\n\nDer Bildschirm hatte einen Fehler – kurz blitzte ein Binärcode auf –, bevor er wieder normal angezeigt wurde. Die Auszahlung? 0 Dollar.\n\nEr lachte darüber, bemerkte aber etwas Seltsames: Seine Uhr tickte rückwärts.\n\nEr spielte weiter. 100 Dollar nach 100 Dollar. Die Zeit selbst schien zu verschwimmen – die Leute bewegten sich langsamer, die Getränke blieben voll, die Luft dicker. Bei Drehung 49 traf er drei Karos. Die Maschine stöhnte und schoss einen Goldchip aus.\n\n„Einstecken, um Phase Zwei freizuschalten“, flüsterte der Bildschirm.\n\nEr zögerte. Dann steckte er ihn ein.\n\nPlötzlich öffnete sich die Maschine und gab einen zweiten Bildschirm frei … einen, der eher wie eine Satellitenschnittstelle als wie ein Spiel aussah. Koordinaten blinkten. Symbole in einer ihm unbekannten Sprache liefen schnell durch die Luft.\n\nDie Sicherheitskontrolle näherte sich. Rote Lichter flackerten auf. Die Maschine sprach erneut:\n\n„Jackpot-Authentifizierung erforderlich. Handfläche auf den Scanner legen.“\n\nBrettski streckte die Hand aus – und hielt inne. Auf seiner Handfläche war ein seltsamer Fleck, der schwach leuchtete.\n\nUnd dann begann der Casinoboden zu beben.\n\nAuf dem Bildschirm flackerte eine letzte Nachricht:\n\n„Nur ein Spieler kann den Thron besteigen.“\n\nUnd der Boden gab unter ihm nach.\n\nFortsetzung folgt.\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski?

En avant pour la guerre.\n\nBrettski est entré au Casino Neon Mirage comme un homme investi d'une mission, avec 10 000 $ qui lui brûlaient les poches. L'air vibrait d'impatience, les lumières clignotant comme des sirènes du destin. Il n'était pas là pour le poker ou la roulette. Non, ce soir, il n'avait d'yeux que pour une seule machine : La Prime du Milliardaire, une toute nouvelle machine à sous dont on disait qu'elle avait un bug… un bug qui pouvait faire tomber le jackpot d'un milliard de dollars.\n\nIl la trouva dans le coin le plus éloigné, à moitié plongée dans l'ombre.

La machine reprit la parole :\n\n« Authentification jackpot requise. Placez la paume sur le scanner. »\n\nBrettski tendit la main, puis s'arrêta. Une étrange marque apparut sur sa paume, faiblement brillante.\n\nPuis, le casino se mit à gronder.\n\nL'écran afficha un dernier message :\n\n« Un seul joueur peut prétendre au trône. »\n\nEt le sol se déroba sous lui.\n\nÀ suivre.\n\n#machines à sous #blackjack #jeux d'argent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ?

The New Edge of Fate DLC Launch is Here! We have the New Year of Prophecy and Season: Renewal (Season of Renewal) that have gone live! We have a New Edge of Fate Campaign, and Kepler, the new Edge of Fate Destination! There are many Kepler Secrets to uncover! We also have the New Sieve Activity! And we have Armor 3.0, Destiny 2 Stats Overhaul, and the New Destiny 2 Portal! All leading to the New Destiny 2: Renegades Star Wars DLC!\nThe Ash and Iron Major Update is here! We return to the Plaguelands Location! We have new Legendary Weapons, and fan favorites like the MIDA Mini-Tool and Dreng! We also have New Exotic Weapons and a New Exotic Quest!\nBut today we're going over the new Ash and Iron Update, and the outrage within the Destiny 2 Community it has caused.\n #destiny2news #destiny2edgeoffate",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#roblox    #gaming",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\nMusic\n\nBuisness Email: aidanguyen08888@gmail.com",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\nMusic\n\nBuisness Email: aidanguyen08888@gmail.com"

It can be played on Windows and macOS through the dedicated desktop apps, as well as on iPhones and iPads via the Roblox app in the App Store. Android users can access it through the Google Play Store, and Xbox One users can enjoy the platform through a dedicated app available in the Microsoft Store.
