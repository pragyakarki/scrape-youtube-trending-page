            "description": "#Medusa2026 #AngelinaJolie #KeanuReeves\n\nWatch This Medusa Fan Made Concept Trailer (2026)\n\nAngelina Jolie gives Medusa, a monster from Greek mythology, a different look in this tragic remake of the mythological legend Medusa, which tells the story of Medusa from her perspective rather than through the eyes of Perseus, a hero. In this version, Jolie portrays Medusa as a hauntingly beautiful and angry woman, a priestess punished by Athena for crimes she did not commit; her transformation into the Gorgon, instead of a form of divine punishment for the crimes she committed, is a result of her being a victim, and Athena's refusal to hold herself accountable for the crime she committed against Medusa. In addition, Keanu Reeves portrays Poseidon with the same level of charming evil that he has portrayed in other roles as the god responsible for Medusa's transformation due to his assault on Athena in her temple and the fact that he has no responsibility for the actions that lead to Medusa's transformation.\n\nWhat is so different about this adaptation is the way it treats the myth as a horror story about misogyny and victim blaming under the guise of divine authority. This version of Medusa also explores the way Medusa became a monster because of the gods' refusal to be held accountable for their cruel behavior towards humans. The special effects in this version of the movie are incredible, using a combination of practical makeup and digital enhancements to create Medusa's snake-like hair as both beautiful and frightening at the same time. The serpentine hair reflects Medusa's emotions and trauma, visually representing the pain she has endured and continues to endure.\n\nYou will see flashbacks to Medusa's life before the curse and the isolation and loneliness she experiences after the curse takes effect, turning to stone every living creature that looks upon her. These images show that Medusa's existence after the curse is a prison of loneliness that is far more torture than any physical chains could possibly inflict. Reeves portrays Poseidon as a powerful god who views human suffering as unworthy of his concern, and each of his brief appearances make it clear that Medusa had no chance of either fighting back against the curse or seeking justice for the abuse she suffered at his hands. The film examines rage as a means of survival and isolation as both a means of protection and a form of punishment. The film shows how one person can become the monster that society labels them as when they are denied all humanity and left with nothing but rage.\n\nExpect the film to have a gothic horror aesthetic in Medusa's lair filled with stone statues of those who have hunted her, a great deal of psychological depth regarding the long-lasting effects of trauma, and the righteous anger that Medusa will experience when she finally understands the power her curse allows her to use. This is not a villain origin story — it is a survivor's testimony about what happens to people when gods play with mortal lives and society blames the victims of divine crimes for their treatment.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis is an unofficial fan-made concept trailer created solely for entertainment and artistic purposes. It is not associated with or endorsed by any film studio or production company.

Campbell is 50-year-old Val, a devoted wife and stay-at-home mom, who is eager to reignite the spark in her marriage when her youngest child leaves for college. Grappling with empty-nest feelings, loneliness and growing emotional distance from her husband Ross (Russell Hornsby), Val begins to realize that her marriage and the woman she once was, may be slipping away. A spontaneous escape to New Orleans to support her pregnant daughter, Kayla (Zing Ashford), awakens long-buried dreams and passions and introduces her to Peter Mosley (Mekhi Phifer), a handsome and charismatic photographer who sees her in ways she has forgotten to see herself.  Reawakening her artistic spirit and rediscovering her worth, Val must face a life-altering question: is it ever too late to choose yourself and the love you truly deserve? 'Mary J. Blige Presents Be Happy' premieres on Saturday, Feb. 7, at 8 p.m. ET/PT as part of Love of a Lifetime.",

Reawakening her artistic spirit and rediscovering her worth, Val must face a life-altering question: is it ever too late to choose yourself and the love you truly deserve? 'Mary J. Blige Presents Be Happy' premieres on Saturday, Feb. 7, at 8 p.m. ET/PT as part of Love of a Lifetime."

            "description": "Take a look at the Official Trailer for The Mortuary Assistant, a horror film adaptation based on the hit video game series distributed by Shudder. Spend a night at the mortuary with The Mortuary Assistant, in theaters on February 13 and streaming on Shudder on March 27.\n\nThe Mortuary Assistant follows newly certified mortician Rebecca Owens, who accepts a night shift at a mortuary, embalming bodies alone after hours. As disturbing events escalate, Rebecca uncovers demonic rituals, the dark secrets of her enigmatic mentor, and her own buried trauma—racing to survive the night before her body becomes a vessel for possession.\n\nThe Mortuary Assistant stars Willa Holland, Paul Sparks, Mark Steger, Shelly Gibson, Keena Ferguson Fraiser, and more. The film was written by Tracee Beebe and Brian Clarke. The Mortuary Assistant was produced by Patrick Ewald’s Epic Pictures via the Company’s horror division, Dread, Cole Payne’s Traverse Media and Jacob P. Heineke. Executive producers include Brian Clarke, Katie Page, Yulissa Morales, Randy Sinquefield, Patrick Fischer and Oliver Garboe.\n\nThe Mortuary Assistant is in theaters on February 13 and streaming on Shudder on March 27.",

                "description": "Take a look at the Official Trailer for The Mortuary Assistant, a horror film adaptation based on the hit video game series distributed by Shudder. Spend a night at the mortuary with The Mortuary Assistant, in theaters on February 13 and streaming on Shudder on March 27.\n\nThe Mortuary Assistant follows newly certified mortician Rebecca Owens, who accepts a night shift at a mortuary, embalming bodies alone after hours. As disturbing events escalate, Rebecca uncovers demonic rituals, the dark secrets of her enigmatic mentor, and her own buried trauma—racing to survive the night before her body becomes a vessel for possession.\n\nThe Mortuary Assistant stars Willa Holland, Paul Sparks, Mark Steger, Shelly Gibson, Keena Ferguson Fraiser, and more. The film was written by Tracee Beebe and Brian Clarke. The Mortuary Assistant was produced by Patrick Ewald’s Epic Pictures via the Company’s horror division, Dread, Cole Payne’s Traverse Media and Jacob P. Heineke. Executive producers include Brian Clarke, Katie Page, Yulissa Morales, Randy Sinquefield, Patrick Fischer and Oliver Garboe.\n\nThe Mortuary Assistant is in theaters on February 13 and streaming on Shudder on March 27."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

            "description": "Three teasers. Three wildly different vibes. One very big Avengers problem.\nThis video is our first watch reaction to three teaser trailers for Avengers: Doomsday, and each one hits a completely different emotional nerve. The first teaser centers on Thor, leaning hard into the dad feels and reminding us just how much weight he has been carrying since the Infinity Saga. The second teaser pivots straight into hype, introducing the X-Men with a bold throwback look that gives Cyclops serious animated ‘97 energy. Then the third teaser brings the unexpected crossover, pairing Black Panther with the Fantastic Four in a meeting that instantly reshapes what this Avengers era might look like. Taken together, these teasers feel less like a single story and more like a warning that the Marvel universe is about to collide in ways we are not emotionally prepared for. Come hang with your internet best friends as we react, lose our minds a little, and start connecting dots that Marvel clearly wants us obsessing over.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/previewd\nMerch: https://previewdmerchandise.com\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/previewd\nJay’s Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/thatkingbunny\n-----\nBonus Action (pReview'd's DnD Actual Play Show): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMWISxq39GTafF2_xkXaKOw\npReview'd Gaming Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFln_0Sjdel34_VhFIgejvQ\n\n#AvengersDoomsday #Marvel #MCU #Avengers #Thor #XMen #Cyclops #FantasticFour #BlackPanther #MarvelTeaser #TrailerReaction #FirstWatch #pReviewd #ChaBoisReact #PeachesUnite\n\n00:00 Intro \n02:09 Thor\n06:44 X-Men\n13:58 Wakanda & FF",

One very big Avengers problem.\nThis video is our first watch reaction to three teaser trailers for Avengers: Doomsday, and each one hits a completely different emotional nerve. The first teaser centers on Thor, leaning hard into the dad feels and reminding us just how much weight he has been carrying since the Infinity Saga. The second teaser pivots straight into hype, introducing the X-Men with a bold throwback look that gives Cyclops serious animated ‘97 energy. Then the third teaser brings the unexpected crossover, pairing Black Panther with the Fantastic Four in a meeting that instantly reshapes what this Avengers era might look like. Taken together, these teasers feel less like a single story and more like a warning that the Marvel universe is about to collide in ways we are not emotionally prepared for.

                "description": "Word lid van mijn Discord-server om met mij en onze community te chatten! We organiseren ook regelmatig giveaways, exclusief op Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nWe zijn TERUG in het casino, en deze keer menen we het serieus! We spelen het BESTE spel in het casino, Blackjack, en we gaan uit het dal klimmen waar ik mezelf onlangs in heb gewerkt, en ENORM WINNEN! Bedankt voor het kijken! Ik waardeer jullie steun enorm op deze reis. Wens me succes, en tot de volgende keer! Laten we de strijd aangaan!\n\nBrettski liep het casino binnen met de stille woede van een man die net tienduizend dollar had zien verdampen. Het verlies galmde nog in zijn oren, maar vanavond ging het niet om het najagen van geld – het ging om precisie. Om perfect blackjack.\n\nHij nam plaats aan een tafel met gedempt licht achterin, waar het lawaai minder was en de handen van de dealer als een uurwerk bewogen. Brettski's gezicht bleef kalm, bijna verveeld, maar zijn geest was scherp. Elke beslissing leek van tevoren bedacht, alsof hij een script volgde dat alleen hij kon zien. Hit. Stand. Double. Elke zet landde vlekkeloos, als noten in een perfect lied.\n\nIn het begin zaten de kaarten hem tegen. Een slechte reeks slonk zijn stack nog verder, en een dronken toerist links van hem lachte iets te hard elke keer dat Brettski verloor. Maar toen veranderde er iets. De dealer begon te breaken. Opnieuw. En opnieuw. Brettski's stack werd in zorgvuldige stapjes weer opgebouwd – geen wilde schommelingen, geen gejuich, gewoon stille accumulatie.\n\nEr ging een uur voorbij. Toen twee.\n\nDe pitbaas verscheen achter hem, alsof hij niet keek. Brettski merkte het toch. Dat deed hij altijd. De dealer veranderde. De stapel veranderde. De sfeer veranderde. Maar de kaarten gehoorzaamden. Brettski klom terug naar quitte, en toen zelfs daarboven. Tienduizend terug. Vijftien. Twintig.\n\nDe dronken toerist stopte met lachen.\n\nNet toen Brettski zijn fiches netjes opstapelde, stopte de croupier midden in het schudden. Ze keek hem aan – niet verrast, niet onder de indruk – maar voorzichtig. De pitbaas boog zich voorover en fluisterde iets in haar oor. Ze knikte eenmaal.\n\n\"Meneer,\" zei ze kalm, terwijl ze de kaarten in de schoen schoof, \"deze volgende hand zal… een beetje anders worden gedeeld.\"\n\nDe lampen boven de tafel flikkerden.\n\nBrettski keek naar zijn fiches, en vervolgens weer naar de vaste blik van de croupier terwijl ze begon te delen.\n\nEn de eerste kaart die werd omgedraaid, was helemaal geen kaart.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski? Brettski is een professionele gokker, net als de oude legendes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot of Lady Luck HQ! In tegenstelling tot deze legendes beschikt Brettski echter over duizenden jaren aan opgeslagen, eeuwenoude kennis, verzameld door de ouderen, op het gebied van vaardigheden zoals gokkasten, roulette, blackjack, craps, bubble craps, poker en baccarat. Brettski's doel als professioneel gokker is simpel: heel Las Vegas bezitten met het geld dat hij verdient met gokken. Abonneer je om zijn reis naar wereldheerschappij te steunen."

Agradezco a todos y cada uno de ustedes su apoyo en este viaje. ¡Deséenme suerte y nos vemos en la próxima! ¡Vamos a la guerra!\n\nBrettski entró al casino con la furia silenciosa de quien acaba de ver evaporarse diez mil dólares. La pérdida aún resonaba en sus oídos, pero esta noche no se trataba de perseguir, sino de precisión. De un blackjack perfecto.\n\nSe sentó en una mesa con poca luz cerca del fondo, donde el ruido se atenuó y las manos del crupier se movían como un reloj. El rostro de Brettski permaneció sereno, casi aburrido, pero su mente ágil. Cada decisión parecía preescrita, como si siguiera un guion que solo él podía ver. Pedir. Plantarse. Doblar. Cada movimiento aterrizaba con precisión, como notas en una canción impecable.\n\nAl principio, las cartas le resistían. Una mala racha redujo aún más su pila, y un turista borracho a su izquierda se reía demasiado fuerte cada vez que Brettski perdía. Pero entonces algo cambió. El crupier empezó a romper. Una y otra vez. La pila de Brettski se reconstruía con cuidado: sin cambios bruscos, sin celebraciones, solo una acumulación silenciosa.\n\nPasó una hora. Luego dos.\n\nEl jefe de mesa apareció detrás de él, fingiendo no mirar. Brettski se dio cuenta de todos modos. Siempre lo hacía. El crupier cambió. La baraja cambió. La atmósfera cambió. Aun así, las cartas obedecieron. Brettski volvió a estar a mano, luego lo superó. Recuperaron diez mil. Quince. Veinte.\n\nEl turista borracho dejó de reír.\n\nJusto cuando Brettski apilaba sus fichas en torres ordenadas, la crupier hizo una pausa a mitad de barajar. Ella lo miró, ni sorprendida ni impresionada, pero con cautela. El jefe de mesa se inclinó y le susurró algo al oído. Ella asintió.\n\n\"Señor\", dijo con calma, deslizando las cartas en el zapato, \"la próxima mano se repartirá... un poco diferente\".\n\nLas luces sobre la mesa parpadearon.\n\nBrettski miró sus fichas y luego volvió a la mirada fija de la crupier mientras ella comenzaba a repartir.\n\nY la primera carta que se volteó no era una carta en absoluto.\n\n#tragamonedas #blackjack #juegos #casino #bacará #ruleta\n\n¿Quién es Brettski? Brettski es un jugador profesional, similar a las antiguas leyendas Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot o Lady Luck HQ.

Ich weiß eure Unterstützung auf diesem Weg sehr zu schätzen. Drückt mir die Daumen, und wir sehen uns beim nächsten Mal! Auf geht's!\n\nBrettski betrat das Casino mit der stillen Wut eines Mannes, der gerade zehntausend Dollar in Luft aufgelöst hatte. Der Verlust hallte ihm noch in den Ohren nach, aber heute Abend ging es nicht ums Hinterherjagen – es ging um Präzision. Um das perfekte Blackjack.\n\nEr nahm an einem schwach beleuchteten Tisch im hinteren Bereich Platz, wo der Lärm gedämpfter war und sich die Hände des Dealers wie ein Uhrwerk bewegten. Brettskis Gesicht blieb ruhig, fast gelangweilt, doch sein Verstand war hellwach. Jede Entscheidung schien vorherbestimmt, als folgte er einem Drehbuch, das nur er kannte. Ziehen. Halten. Verdoppeln. Jeder Zug saß perfekt, wie die Noten in einem makellosen Lied.\n\nAnfangs wehrten sich die Karten gegen ihn. Eine Pechsträhne dezimierte seinen Stapel weiter, und ein betrunkener Tourist zu seiner Linken lachte jedes Mal etwas zu laut, wenn Brettski verlor. Doch dann änderte sich etwas. Der Dealer begann zu steigen. Immer wieder. Brettskis Stapel baute sich vorsichtig wieder auf – keine wilden Schwankungen, kein Jubel, nur stilles Anhäufen.\n\nEine Stunde verging. Dann zwei.\n\nDer Pitboss tauchte hinter ihm auf und tat so, als sähe er nicht hin. Brettski bemerkte es trotzdem. Das tat er immer. Der Dealer wechselte. Das Kartenspiel wechselte. Die Stimmung änderte sich. Doch die Karten gehorchten ihm. Brettski kämpfte sich wieder auf den Ausgangswert vor, dann darüber hinaus. Zehntausend wiedererlangt. Fünfzehn. Zwanzig.\n\nDer betrunkene Tourist hörte auf zu lachen.\n\nGerade als Brettski seine Chips zu ordentlichen Türmen stapelte, hielt die Dealerin mitten im Mischen inne. Sie sah ihn an – nicht überrascht, nicht beeindruckt, sondern vorsichtig. Der Pitboss beugte sich vor und flüsterte ihr etwas ins Ohr. Sie nickte einmal.\n\n„Sir“, sagte sie ruhig und schob die Karten in den Kartenschlitten, „die nächste Hand wird… etwas anders ausgeteilt.“\n\nDie Lichter über dem Tisch flackerten.\n\nBrettski blickte auf seine Chips und dann wieder in die ruhigen Augen der Dealerin, als sie mit dem Austeilen begann.\n\nUnd die erste Karte, die aufgedeckt wurde, war gar keine Karte.\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski?

I appreciate each and everyone of you supporting me on this journey. Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nBrettski walked into the casino with the quiet fury of a man who’d just watched ten thousand dollars evaporate. The loss still rang in his ears, but tonight wasn’t about chasing—it was about precision. About perfect blackjack.\n\nHe took a seat at a low-lit table near the back, where the noise dulled and the dealer’s hands moved like clockwork. Brettski’s face stayed calm, almost bored, but his mind was sharp. Every decision felt prewritten, as if he were following a script only he could see. Hit. Stand. Double. Each move landed cleanly, like notes in a flawless song.\n\nAt first, the cards fought him. A bad run shaved his stack down even further, and a drunk tourist to his left laughed a little too loudly every time Brettski lost. But then something shifted. The dealer began breaking. Again. And again. Brettski’s stack rebuilt itself in careful increments—no wild swings, no celebration, just quiet accumulation.\n\nAn hour passed. Then two.\n\nThe pit boss appeared behind him, pretending not to watch. Brettski noticed anyway. He always did. The dealer changed. The deck changed. The vibe changed. Still, the cards obeyed. Brettski climbed back to even, then past it. Ten thousand recovered. Fifteen. Twenty.\n\nThe drunk tourist stopped laughing.\n\nJust as Brettski stacked his chips into neat towers, the dealer paused mid-shuffle. She looked up at him—not surprised, not impressed—but cautious. The pit boss leaned in and whispered something into her ear. She nodded once.\n\n“Sir,” she said calmly, sliding the cards into the shoe, “this next hand will be dealt… a little differently.”\n\nThe lights above the table flickered.\n\nBrettski glanced down at his chips, then back at the dealer’s steady eyes as she began to deal.\n\nAnd the first card that flipped over wasn’t a card at all.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski?

Vamos jogar o MELHOR jogo do cassino, Blackjack, e vamos sair do buraco em que me meti recentemente e GANHAR MUITO! Obrigado por assistir! Agradeço a cada um de vocês pelo apoio nesta jornada. Me desejem sorte e nos vemos no próximo vídeo! Que comece a guerra!\n\nBrettski entrou no cassino com a fúria contida de um homem que acabara de ver dez mil dólares evaporarem. A perda ainda ecoava em seus ouvidos, mas esta noite não se tratava de correr atrás do prejuízo — tratava-se de precisão. De um blackjack perfeito.\n\nEle se sentou em uma mesa com pouca luz no fundo, onde o barulho diminuía e as mãos do crupiê se moviam como um relógio. O rosto de Brettski permaneceu calmo, quase entediado, mas sua mente estava afiada. Cada decisão parecia pré-escrita, como se ele estivesse seguindo um roteiro que só ele podia ver. Pedir carta. Parar. Dobrar. Cada movimento era preciso, como notas em uma música impecável.\n\nNo início, as cartas lutaram contra ele. Uma sequência ruim reduziu ainda mais suas fichas, e um turista bêbado à sua esquerda ria um pouco alto demais cada vez que Brettski perdia. Mas então algo mudou. O crupiê começou a quebrar. De novo. E de novo. As fichas de Brettski se reconstruíram em incrementos cuidadosos — sem oscilações bruscas, sem comemorações, apenas um acúmulo silencioso.\n\nUma hora se passou. Depois duas.\n\nO gerente do cassino apareceu atrás dele, fingindo não estar olhando. Brettski percebeu mesmo assim. Ele sempre percebia. O crupiê mudou. O baralho mudou. A atmosfera mudou. Ainda assim, as cartas obedeciam. Brettski recuperou o valor inicial, depois ultrapassou esse ponto. Dez mil fichas recuperadas. Quinze. Vinte.\n\nO turista bêbado parou de rir.\n\nAssim que Brettski empilhou suas fichas em torres organizadas, a crupiê parou no meio do embaralhamento. Ela olhou para ele — não surpresa, nem impressionada — mas cautelosa. O gerente do cassino se inclinou e sussurrou algo em seu ouvido. Ela assentiu uma vez.\n\n\"Senhor\", disse ela calmamente, deslizando as cartas de volta para o sapato, \"a próxima mão será distribuída... de uma maneira um pouco diferente.\"\n\nAs luzes acima da mesa piscaram.\n\nBrettski olhou para suas fichas e depois para o olhar firme da crupiê enquanto ela começava a distribuir as cartas.\n\nE a primeira carta que virou não era uma carta de verdade.\n\n#caça-níqueis #blackjack #apostas #cassino #bacará #roleta\n\nQuem é Brettski? Brettski é um Jogador Profissional, semelhante às antigas lendas Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot ou Lady Luck HQ!

Мы играем в ЛУЧШУЮ игру в казино, блэкджек, и мы выберемся из той ямы, в которую я недавно попал, и ВЫИГРАЕМ ОГРОМНУЮ СУПЕР-СУПЕР-СУПЕР-СУПЕР! Спасибо за просмотр! Я ценю поддержку каждого из вас на этом пути. Пожелайте мне удачи, и увидимся в следующем видео! Вперед, на войну!\n\nБретски вошел в казино с тихой яростью человека, который только что наблюдал, как испарились десять тысяч долларов. Проигрыш все еще звенел у него в ушах, но сегодня речь шла не о погоне за победой — а о точности. О идеальном блэкджеке.\n\nОн сел за слабо освещенный стол в глубине зала, где шум приглушался, а руки дилера двигались как часы. Лицо Бретски оставалось спокойным, почти скучающим, но ум был острым. Каждое решение казалось заранее написанным, словно он следовал сценарию, который видел только он. Взять карту. Остановиться. Удвоить ставку. Каждый ход был безупречен, как ноты в идеальной песне.\n\nПоначалу карты сопротивлялись. Неудачная серия еще больше уменьшила его стопку, а пьяный турист слева от него слишком громко смеялся каждый раз, когда Бретски проигрывал. Но потом что-то изменилось. Дилер начал проигрывать. Снова. И снова. Стопка Бретски восстанавливалась постепенно, без резких колебаний, без празднований, просто тихое накопление.\n\nПрошел час. Потом два.\n\nЗа его спиной появился менеджер игрового зала, делая вид, что не смотрит. Бретски все равно заметил. Он всегда замечал. Дилер сменился. Колода изменилась. Атмосфера изменилась. И все же карты подчинились. Бретски вернулся к равновесию, а затем и превзошел его. Восстановилось десять тысяч. Пятнадцать. Двадцать.\n\nПьяный турист перестал смеяться.\n\nКак только Бретски начал аккуратно складывать фишки в стопки, дилер остановилась посреди перетасовки. Она посмотрела на него — не удивленная, не впечатленная, но настороженная. Менеджер зала наклонился и что-то прошептал ей на ухо. Она кивнула один раз.\n\n«Сэр, — спокойно сказала она, вставляя карты в шулерскую колоду, — следующая раздача будет… немного другой».\n\nЛампы над столом замерцали.\n\nБретски взглянул на свои фишки, затем снова на спокойный взгляд дилера, когда она начала раздавать карты.\n\nИ первая перевернутая карта оказалась вовсе не картой.\n\n#слоты #блэкджек #азартныеигрыши #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nКто такой Бретски? Бретски — профессиональный игрок, похожий на древних легенд Вегаса Мэтта, Блаффа, ДегенДальта, БигДжекпота или Леди Удачи! Однако, в отличие от этих легенд, Бретски обладает тысячелетним опытом, накопленным старейшинами в таких областях, как игровые автоматы, рулетка, блэкджек, крэпс, баббл-крэпс, покер и баккара. Цель Бретски как профессионального игрока проста: завладеть всем Лас-Вегасом, используя средства, полученные от азартных игр. Подпишитесь, чтобы поддержать его путь к мировому господству."

Doceniam każdego z Was, kto mnie wspiera w tej podróży. Życzcie mi powodzenia i do zobaczenia w następnym odcinku! Do boju!\n\nBrettski wszedł do kasyna z cichą furią człowieka, który właśnie patrzył, jak dziesięć tysięcy dolarów wyparowuje. Strata wciąż dźwięczała mu w uszach, ale dziś nie chodziło o pogoń – chodziło o precyzję. O idealnego blackjacka.\n\nUsiadł przy słabo oświetlonym stoliku z tyłu, gdzie hałas przycichł, a wskazówki krupiera poruszały się jak w zegarku. Twarz Brettskiego pozostała spokojna, niemal znudzona, ale umysł miał bystry. Każda decyzja wydawała się z góry napisana, jakby podążał za scenariuszem, który tylko on widział. Dobieranie. Stawka. Podwajanie. Każdy ruch trafiał idealnie, niczym nuty w idealnej piosence.\n\nNa początku karty mu przeszkadzały. Zła passa jeszcze bardziej uszczupliła jego stack, a pijany turysta po jego lewej stronie śmiał się trochę za głośno za każdym razem, gdy Brettski przegrywał. Ale potem coś się zmieniło. Krupier zaczął rozdawać karty. Raz po raz. I jeszcze raz. Stos Brettskiego odbudowywał się stopniowo – bez gwałtownych wahań, bez świętowania, po prostu cicha kumulacja.\n\nMinęła godzina. Potem dwie.\n\nZa nim pojawił się szef sali, udając, że nie patrzy. Brettski i tak to zauważył. Zawsze to robił. Krupier się zmienił. Talia się zmieniła. Atmosfera się zmieniła. Mimo to karty posłuchały. Brettski wrócił do parzystej, a potem ją przekroczył. Odzyskał dziesięć tysięcy. Piętnaście. Dwadzieścia.\n\nPijany turysta przestał się śmiać.\n\nGdy Brettski układał swoje żetony w równe wieże, krupierka zatrzymała się w połowie tasowania. Spojrzała na niego – nie zaskoczona, nie pod wrażeniem – ale ostrożna. Kierownik sali pochylił się i szepnął jej coś do ucha. Skinęła głową.\n\n„Proszę pana” – powiedziała spokojnie, wsuwając karty do tacki – „następna ręka zostanie rozdana… trochę inaczej”.\n\nŚwiatła nad stołem zamigotały.\n\nBrettski spojrzał na swoje żetony, a potem z powrotem na spokojne oczy krupiera, który zaczął rozdawać.\n\nA pierwsza odkryta karta wcale nie była kartą.\n\n#automaty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski? Brettski to profesjonalny hazardzista, podobny do starożytnych legend Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot czy Lady Luck HQ! Jednak w przeciwieństwie do tych legend, Brettski posiada tysiące lat starożytnej wiedzy zgromadzonej przez starszyznę, obejmującej takie umiejętności jak automaty do gry, ruletka, blackjack, kości, bubble craps, poker i bakarat.

Ми також проводимо купу розіграшів ЛИШЕ на Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nМи ПОВЕРНУЛИСЯ в Казино, і цього разу ми не будемо жартувати! Ми граємо в НАЙКРАЩУ гру в казино, Блекджек, і ми виберемося з ями, в яку я нещодавно потрапив, і ВИГРАЄМО ВЕЛИЧЕЗНООООООО! Дякую за перегляд! Я ціную кожного з вас, хто підтримує мене в цій подорожі. Побажайте мені удачі, і побачимося в наступній! Давайте війною!\n\nБреттскі зайшов у казино з тихою люттю людини, яка щойно спостерігала, як випаровуються десять тисяч доларів. Програш все ще дзвенів у його вухах, але сьогодні ввечері йшлося не про погоню, а про точність. Про ідеальний блекджек.\n\nВін сів за слабо освітлений стіл біля задньої частини, де шум приглушувався, а стрілки дилера рухалися як годинник. Обличчя Бретскі залишалося спокійним, майже нудьгуючим, але розум був гострим. Кожне рішення здавалося заздалегідь написаним, ніби він слідував сценарію, який бачив лише він. Вдар. Стій. Подвій. Кожен хід приземлявся чисто, як ноти в бездоганній пісні.\n\nСпочатку карти боролися з ним. Невдалий пробіг ще більше зменшив його стек, а п'яний турист ліворуч від нього сміявся трохи занадто голосно щоразу, коли Бретскі програвав. Але потім щось змінилося. Дилер почав ламати. Знову. І знову. Стек Бретскі відновлювався обережними кроками — жодних шалених коливань, жодного святкування, лише тихе накопичення.\n\nМинула година. Потім дві.\n\nПозаду нього з'явився бос піт-стопа, вдаючи, що не дивиться. Бретскі все одно помітив. Він завжди це помічав. Дилер змінився. Колода змінилася. Атмосфера змінилася. Тим не менш, карти слухалися. Бретскі піднявся назад до парного рівня, потім перевищив його. Десять тисяч повернулися. П'ятнадцять. Двадцять.\n\nП'яний турист перестав сміятися.\n\nТільки що Бретскі склав свої фішки в акуратні вежі, дилер зупинився посеред тасування. Вона подивилася на нього — не здивовано, не вражено — але обережно. Бос піт-столу нахилився і щось прошепотів їй на вухо. Вона кивнула один раз.\n\n«Сер», — спокійно сказала вона, вставляючи карти в лоток, — «наступна роздача буде роздана… трохи інакше».\n\nСвітло над столом мерехтіло.\n\nБреттскі глянув на свої фішки, потім знову на спокійний погляд дилера, коли вона почала роздавати.\n\nІ перша карта, що перевернулася, взагалі не була картою.\n\n#слоти #блекджек #азартніігри #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nХто такий Бреттскі? Бреттскі — професійний гравець, подібний до давніх легенд Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot або Lady Luck HQ! Однак, на відміну від цих легенд, Бреттскі володіє тисячолітніми давніми знаннями, зібраними старійшинами, у таких навичках, як ігрові автомати, рулетка, блекджек, крепс, міхуровий крепс, покер і баккара. Мета Бреттскі як професійного гравця проста: володіти всім Лас-Вегасом, використовуючи кошти, зароблені Gambling. Підпишіться, щоб підтримати його шлях до світового панування."

Saya menghargai dukungan kalian semua dalam perjalanan ini. Doakan saya beruntung, dan sampai jumpa di video selanjutnya! Mari kita berperang!\n\nBrettski memasuki kasino dengan amarah yang terpendam dari seorang pria yang baru saja menyaksikan sepuluh ribu dolar lenyap. Kekalahan itu masih terngiang di telinganya, tetapi malam ini bukan tentang mengejar—ini tentang ketepatan. Tentang blackjack yang sempurna.\n\nDia duduk di meja yang remang-remang di dekat bagian belakang, di mana kebisingan meredam dan tangan dealer bergerak seperti jam. Wajah Brettski tetap tenang, hampir bosan, tetapi pikirannya tajam. Setiap keputusan terasa sudah ditulis sebelumnya, seolah-olah dia mengikuti skrip yang hanya dia yang bisa melihatnya. Ambil kartu. Berhenti. Gandakan. Setiap langkah mendarat dengan bersih, seperti nada dalam lagu yang sempurna.\n\nAwalnya, kartu-kartu itu melawannya. Serangkaian kartu buruk semakin mengurangi tumpukannya, dan seorang turis mabuk di sebelah kirinya tertawa terlalu keras setiap kali Brettski kalah. Tapi kemudian sesuatu berubah. Bandar mulai melakukan break. Lagi. Dan lagi. Tumpukan Brettski kembali bertambah sedikit demi sedikit—tidak ada perubahan drastis, tidak ada perayaan, hanya akumulasi yang tenang.\n\nSatu jam berlalu. Kemudian dua jam.\n\nKepala kasino muncul di belakangnya, berpura-pura tidak memperhatikan. Brettski tetap memperhatikan. Dia selalu memperhatikan. Bandar berubah. Kartu berubah. Suasana berubah. Namun, kartu-kartu itu tetap patuh. Brettski kembali ke titik impas, lalu melewatinya. Sepuluh ribu pulih. Lima belas. Dua puluh.\n\nTuris mabuk itu berhenti tertawa.\n\nSaat Brettski menumpuk chipnya menjadi menara yang rapi, bandar berhenti sejenak di tengah pengocokan. Ia menatapnya—tidak terkejut, tidak terkesan—tetapi waspada. Kepala meja judi mencondongkan tubuh dan membisikkan sesuatu ke telinganya. Ia mengangguk sekali.\n\n“Tuan,” katanya dengan tenang, sambil memasukkan kartu ke dalam kotak kartu, “putaran selanjutnya akan dibagikan… sedikit berbeda.”\n\nLampu di atas meja berkedip-kedip.\n\nBrettski melirik chipnya, lalu kembali menatap mata bandar yang tenang saat ia mulai membagikan kartu.\n\nDan kartu pertama yang terbalik bukanlah kartu sama sekali.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nSiapa Brettski? Brettski adalah Penjudi Profesional, mirip dengan legenda lama Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, atau Lady Luck HQ! Namun, tidak seperti legenda-legenda tersebut, Brettski memiliki ribuan tahun pengetahuan kuno yang diwariskan oleh para tetua, dalam keterampilan seperti Mesin Slot, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, dan Baccarat. Tujuan Brettski sebagai Penjudi Profesional sederhana: memiliki seluruh Las Vegas, menggunakan dana yang diperoleh dari perjudian. Berlangganan untuk mendukung perjalanannya dalam dominasi dunia."

                "description": "O que há com essa versão de pesadelo do Yoshi ou que tal essa criatura perturbadora Mario Dry Bones? Bem, estes são os personagens cortados mais assustadores do Mario que foram removidos por razões desconhecidas. Por exemplo, há essa variante não utilizada dos inimigos Noknok de Mario Wonder. É muito parecido com os normais, mas tem uma cor vermelha com um único dente vermelho. Era para ser como sangue pingando desse dente ou algo assim? Eu não sei. Mas é praticamente o mesmo que o inimigo original, apenas capaz de te detectar de uma distância maior. Mas isso é apenas a ponta do iceberg, porque as coisas só ficarão mais assustadoras e estranhas daqui para frente.\n\nTodo mundo conhece Mario por mundos coloridos e diversão para a família, mas no fundo dos arquivos do jogo jazem alguns segredos verdadeiramente inquietantes. De uma versão de pesadelo de Yoshi com olhos sem alma a um bizarro Mario esquelético que se desfaz com o impacto, a Nintendo cortou uma quantidade surpreendente de combustível de pesadelo de seus maiores lançamentos. Neste vídeo, estamos mergulhando fundo no código para descobrir os personagens e inimigos não utilizados mais assustadores que foram removidos por razões desconhecidas.\n\nExploraremos os cantos estranhos dos jogos Super Mario Galaxy, olhando para o Goomba de Ferro \"TetuKuri\" e a inquietante \"Rainha Polvo\" que se parece mais com uma Planta Piranha mutante. Também damos uma olhada na versão beta de Super Mario 64 para ver os designs originais de olhar vazio para os pinguins que felizmente não chegaram ao corte final. Além disso, investigamos o misterioso \"m787.bin\" encontrado em Mario Party 7—um peixe robótico enterrado nos arquivos que parece aterrorizantemente fora de lugar.\n\nNão são apenas os jogos 3D que escondem segredos. Também estamos cavando nos arquivos de Super Mario World para revelar dinossauros gigantes e um inimigo Flor de Fogo deformado que parece uma experiência falha. Também cobriremos o fantasma \"Basher\" de Luigi's Mansion, um inimigo tão assustador que foi programado para fazer Luigi perder instantaneamente metade de sua vida por puro choque. Junte-se a nós enquanto olhamos para os designs que a Nintendo decidiu que eram simplesmente estranhos demais ou assustadores demais para os jogos finais.\n\nInfiniteBits Infinite Bits\n\n2nd Channel ▶ youtube.com/@8-BitBrad\nInstagram ▶ https://www.instagram.com/infinitebitstv/ \nTwitter  ▶ https://twitter.com/InfiniteBitsTV\n\nOutro Music: Sappheiros - Aurora\n#SuperMario #ConteudoCortado #MarioAssustador"

Eh bien, ce sont les personnages coupés les plus effrayants de Mario qui ont été retirés pour des raisons inconnues. Par exemple, il y a cette variante inutilisée des ennemis Noknok de Mario Wonder. Elle ressemble beaucoup aux normaux mais a une couleur rouge avec une seule dent rouge. Était-ce censé être comme du sang qui coule de cette dent ou quelque chose comme ça ? Je ne sais pas. Mais c'est pratiquement la même chose que l'ennemi original, juste capable de vous repérer d'une plus longue distance. Mais ce n'est que la pointe de l'iceberg, car les choses vont devenir de plus en plus effrayantes et étranges à partir de maintenant.\n\nTout le monde connaît Mario pour ses mondes colorés et son plaisir familial, mais au fond des fichiers du jeu se cachent des secrets vraiment troublants. D'une version cauchemardesque de Yoshi aux yeux sans âme à un bizarre Mario squelettique qui tombe en morceaux à l'impact, Nintendo a coupé une quantité surprenante de matériel de cauchemar de ses plus grandes sorties. Dans cette vidéo, nous plongeons profondément dans le code pour découvrir les personnages et ennemis inutilisés les plus effrayants qui ont été retirés pour des raisons inconnues.\n\nNous explorerons les coins étranges des jeux Super Mario Galaxy, en regardant le Goomba de Fer \"TetuKuri\" et l'inquiétante \"Reine Octopus\" qui ressemble plus à une Plante Piranha mutée. Nous jetons également un coup d'œil à la version bêta de Super Mario 64 pour voir les designs originaux au regard vide pour les pingouins qui, heureusement, n'ont pas été retenus au montage final. De plus, nous enquêtons sur le mystérieux \"m787.bin\" trouvé dans Mario Party 7—un poisson robotique enfoui dans les fichiers qui a l'air terriblement déplacé.\n\nCe ne sont pas seulement les jeux 3D qui cachent des secrets. Nous creusons également dans les fichiers de Super Mario World pour révéler des dinosaures géants et un ennemi Fleur de Feu déformé qui ressemble à une expérience ratée. Nous couvrirons également le fantôme \"Basher\" de Luigi's Mansion, un ennemi si effrayant qu'il était scripté pour faire perdre instantanément la moitié de sa santé à Luigi par pur choc. Rejoignez-nous alors que nous examinons les designs que Nintendo a décidé être tout simplement trop bizarres ou trop effrayants pour les jeux finaux.\n\nInfiniteBits Infinite Bits\n\n2nd Channel ▶ youtube.com/@8-BitBrad\nInstagram ▶ https://www.instagram.com/infinitebitstv/ \nTwitter  ▶ https://twitter.com/InfiniteBitsTV\n\nOutro Music: Sappheiros - Aurora\n#SuperMario #ContenuCoupé #MarioEffrayant"

                "description": "¿Qué pasa con esta versión de pesadilla de Yoshi o qué tal esta inquietante criatura Mario Huesitos? Bueno, estos son los personajes eliminados más aterradores de Mario que fueron removidos por razones desconocidas. Por ejemplo, está esta variante no utilizada de los enemigos Noknok de Mario Wonder. Es muy parecido a los normales, pero tiene un color rojo con un solo diente rojo. ¿Se suponía que debía ser como sangre goteando de este diente o algo así? No lo sé. Pero es prácticamente igual al enemigo original, solo que capaz de detectarte desde una distancia mayor. Pero eso es solo la punta del iceberg, porque las cosas solo se pondrán más espeluznantes y extrañas a partir de aquí.\n\nTodo el mundo conoce a Mario por sus mundos coloridos y diversión familiar, pero en lo profundo de los archivos del juego yacen algunos secretos verdaderamente inquietantes. Desde una versión de pesadilla de Yoshi con ojos sin alma hasta un extraño Mario esquelético que se desmorona al impactar, Nintendo ha eliminado una cantidad sorprendente de material de pesadilla de sus lanzamientos más grandes. En este video, nos sumergimos profundamente en el código para descubrir los personajes y enemigos no utilizados más aterradores que fueron eliminados por razones desconocidas.\n\nExploraremos los rincones extraños de los juegos de Super Mario Galaxy, mirando al Goomba de Hierro \"TetuKuri\" y a la inquietante \"Reina Pulpo\" que se parece más a una Planta Piraña mutada. También echamos un vistazo a la versión beta de Super Mario 64 para ver los diseños originales de mirada vacía para los pingüinos que afortunadamente no llegaron al corte final. Además, investigamos el misterioso \"m787.bin\" encontrado en Mario Party 7—un pez robótico enterrado en los archivos que se ve aterradoramente fuera de lugar.\n\nNo son solo los juegos en 3D los que esconden secretos. También estamos excavando en los archivos de Super Mario World para revelar dinosaurios gigantes y un enemigo Flor de Fuego deformado que parece un experimento fallido. También cubriremos al fantasma \"Basher\" de Luigi's Mansion, un enemigo tan aterrador que estaba programado para hacer que Luigi perdiera instantáneamente la mitad de su salud por pura conmoción. Únete a nosotros mientras miramos los diseños que Nintendo decidió que eran simplemente demasiado extraños o demasiado aterradores para los juegos finales.\n\nInfiniteBits Infinite Bits\n\n2nd Channel ▶ youtube.com/@8-BitBrad\nInstagram ▶ https://www.instagram.com/infinitebitstv/ \nTwitter  ▶ https://twitter.com/InfiniteBitsTV\n\nOutro Music: Sappheiros - Aurora\n#SuperMario #ContenidoEliminado #MarioAterrador"

                "description": "What’s with this nightmare version of Yoshi or how about this unsettling Mario Dry bones creature. Well these are the Creepiest Cut Mario characters that were removed for unknown reasons. For example, there’s this unused variant of the noknok enemies from Mario Wonder. It's a lot like the normal ones but instead has a red color to it with a single red tooth. Was it supposed to be like dripping blood from this tooth or something, I don't know. But it’s pretty well the same as the original enemy, just being able to spot you from a longer distance. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg, because things will only get creepier and weirder from here on out. \nEveryone knows Mario for colorful worlds and family-friendly fun, but deep inside the game files lie some truly unsettling secrets. From a nightmare version of Yoshi with soulless eyes to a bizarre skeletal Mario that falls apart on impact, Nintendo has cut a surprising amount of nightmare fuel from their biggest releases. In this video, we are diving deep into the code to uncover the creepiest unused characters and enemies that were removed for unknown reasons.\n\nWe’ll explore the strange corners of the Super Mario Galaxy games, looking at the \"TetuKuri\" Iron Goomba and the unsettling \"Octopus Queen\" that looks more like a mutated Piranha Plant. We also take a look back at Super Mario 64’s beta build to see the original, blank-staring designs for the Penguins that thankfully didn’t make the final cut. Plus, we investigate the mysterious \"m787.bin\" found in Mario Party 7—a robotic fish buried in the files that looks terrifyingly out of place.\n\nIt’s not just the 3D games that are hiding secrets. We are also digging into the files of Super Mario World to reveal giant dinosaurs and a warped Fire Flower enemy that looks like a failed experiment. We’ll also cover the \"Basher\" ghost from Luigi’s Mansion, an enemy so scary it was scripted to make Luigi instantly lose half his health from sheer shock. Join us as we look at the designs that Nintendo decided were just too weird or too scary for the final games.\n\n\nInfiniteBits Infinite Bits\n\n2nd Channel ▶ youtube.com/@8-BitBrad\nInstagram ▶ https://www.instagram.com/infinitebitstv/ \nTwitter  ▶ https://twitter.com/InfiniteBitsTV\n\nOutro Music: Sappheiros - Aurora\n\n#SuperMario #CutContent  #CreepyMario"

                "description": "Was hat es mit dieser Albtraum-Version von Yoshi auf sich oder wie wäre es mit dieser beunruhigenden Mario-Knochentrocken-Kreatur? Nun, das sind die gruseligsten geschnittenen Mario-Charaktere, die aus unbekannten Gründen entfernt wurden. Zum Beispiel gibt es diese ungenutzte Variante der Noknok-Gegner aus Mario Wonder. Sie ähnelt den normalen sehr, hat aber eine rote Farbe mit einem einzigen roten Zahn. Sollte das wie Blut sein, das von diesem Zahn tropft oder so? Ich weiß es nicht. Aber es ist im Grunde dasselbe wie der ursprüngliche Gegner, nur dass er dich aus einer größeren Entfernung entdecken kann. Aber das ist nur die Spitze des Eisbergs, denn von hier an wird es nur noch gruseliger und seltsamer.\n\nJeder kennt Mario für bunte Welten und familienfreundlichen Spaß, aber tief in den Spieldateien liegen einige wahrhaft beunruhigende Geheimnisse. Von einer Albtraum-Version von Yoshi mit seelenlosen Augen bis hin zu einem bizarren Skelett-Mario, der beim Aufprall zerfällt: Nintendo hat eine überraschende Menge an Albtraumstoff aus ihren größten Veröffentlichungen geschnitten. In diesem Video tauchen wir tief in den Code ein, um die gruseligsten ungenutzten Charaktere und Gegner aufzudecken, die aus unbekannten Gründen entfernt wurden.\n\nWir erkunden die seltsamen Ecken der Super Mario Galaxy-Spiele und schauen uns den \"TetuKuri\"-Eisen-Gumba und die beunruhigende \"Oktopus-Königin\" an, die eher wie eine mutierte Piranha-Pflanze aussieht. Wir werfen auch einen Blick zurück auf den Beta-Build von Super Mario 64, um die ursprünglichen Designs der Pinguine mit leerem Blick zu sehen, die es zum Glück nicht in den endgültigen Schnitt geschafft haben. Außerdem untersuchen wir die mysteriöse \"m787.bin\", die in Mario Party 7 gefunden wurde – ein Roboterfisch, der in den Dateien vergraben ist und erschreckend fehl am Platz wirkt.\n\nEs sind nicht nur die 3D-Spiele, die Geheimnisse verbergen. Wir graben auch in den Dateien von Super Mario World, um riesige Dinosaurier und einen verzerrten Feuerblumen-Gegner zu enthüllen, der wie ein gescheitertes Experiment aussieht. Wir werden auch den \"Basher\"-Geist aus Luigi's Mansion behandeln, einen Gegner, der so gruselig war, dass er so programmiert wurde, dass Luigi vor lauter Schock sofort die Hälfte seiner Gesundheit verliert. Begleite uns, wenn wir uns die Designs ansehen, von denen Nintendo entschied, dass sie einfach zu seltsam oder zu gruselig für die endgültigen Spiele waren.\n\nInfiniteBits Infinite Bits\n\n2nd Channel ▶ youtube.com/@8-BitBrad\nInstagram ▶ https://www.instagram.com/infinitebitstv/ \nTwitter  ▶ https://twitter.com/InfiniteBitsTV\n\nOutro Music: Sappheiros - Aurora\n#SuperMario #CutContent #GruseligesMario"
