Check out https://joshjohnsoncomedy.com/tour for dates and to sign up for the waitlist to be notified when I'm performing in your city.\n\nHi Friends,\n\nThis week I wanted to share my thoughts on Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show and why I think it is impacting the country the way it is. \n\nKendrick Lamar has surpassed Michael Jackson for most watched superbowl halftime show and joins an incredible group of elite talent and star power in even performing. Rihanna, Usher, Justin Timberlake, Prince, and so many others have brought us halftime shows that reminded us of their hits like Diamonds, U Got It Bad, SexyBack, and Purple Rain. \n\nKendrick chose to do something different and that’s why we’re obsessed.\n\nIf you love my stories I have a podcast that comes out every week: https://bit.ly/3NQmpio \n\nHit me on them internets: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@joshjohnsoncomedy \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy Video \n\nRecorded at The Orange Peel in Asheville, NC",

Check out https://joshjohnsoncomedy.com/tour for dates and to sign up for the waitlist to be notified when I'm performing in your city.\n\nHi Friends,\n\nThis week I wanted to share my thoughts on Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show and why I think it is impacting the country the way it is. \n\nKendrick Lamar has surpassed Michael Jackson for most watched superbowl halftime show and joins an incredible group of elite talent and star power in even performing. Rihanna, Usher, Justin Timberlake, Prince, and so many others have brought us halftime shows that reminded us of their hits like Diamonds, U Got It Bad, SexyBack, and Purple Rain. \n\nKendrick chose to do something different and that’s why we’re obsessed.\n\nIf you love my stories I have a podcast that comes out every week: https://bit.ly/3NQmpio \n\nHit me on them internets: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@joshjohnsoncomedy \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy Video \n\nRecorded at The Orange Peel in Asheville, NC"

I'm a Minecraft channel though, so of course we had to make it unique.\n\nWe coded a mod that makes it so you can scan things from real life into Minecraft. Of course the first thing we did with this mod was scan our ENTIRE HOUSE into Minecraft! We did this on Minecraft 1.21.4, but it's possible on basically any version! 1.8, 1.20, etc. The mod is called BlockPrintr.\n\nThis video is a mix of IRL vlog style content, and in game Minecraft content. Both showing off the house. We toured Sapnap's office and room, George's office and room, and the rest of the house!\n\nThank you guys for all of the love and support! Lots more cool stuff to come, another Titan Minecraft Manhunt is hopefully the next video! Comment down below ideas :)",

One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!",

            "description": "Kylie’s back for a very special, supersized Valentine’s Day episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Cheerios and is joined by her first-ever male guest: her husband of seven years and Valentine: Jason Kelce. \n\nIn honor of this lovely occasion, we needed an entire hour to get to the bottom of who between Kylie and Jason is the LEAST romantic, where they actually went on their second official date and the hilarious moment that has Kylie crying laughing retelling the story.\n\nThe Kelces also talk about their “babymoon” in New Orleans, including the best foods they ate and that viral photo of Kylie housing a bag of cheetos in the suite during the Super Bowl.\n\nKylie and Jason then get honest about Valentine’s Day as a couple and as parents. They get into how they’ve celebrated in the past, their love languages and what traditions they now have with the girls.\n\nThen, in honor of their 7-ish years of marriage, Kylie and Jason answer 7-ish couples questions from the NGLers. They get into the best marriage advice they’ve ever received, the best gifts they’ve ever gotten each other, and whether or not they’d allow their daughters to date a football player when they’re older.\n\nAfter that, because no couples episode is complete without a game, Jason and Kylie play a game of “Pop Culture Trivia Off: The Battle For Who Knows the Least.” Kylie and Jason both admittedly don’t know much about current pop culture so they put their (lack of) knowledge to the test.\n\nMake sure you tune in to More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for a very special weird pregnancy cravings taste test!

I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Well don't act like you're surprised\nDays keep adding up, finding ways to still feel young\nFighting back them heavy hands of time\nSo you can lay your cards down, if you want to\nCause the dealer has the winning hand, and you were born to lose\nGood is what you want to be, but that's a side you'll never see\nCause fuckin' ups way easier to do\nYeah that sounds pretty on brand for you\nFor you\nCause you and I in a room\nIs a bad combination\nAny call after two\nIs a bad conversation\nAnd it's all gas, cut the breaks\nDrinking late at degenerate rates\nCalling out to God to give me a sign\nCause I'm in a bad state of mind\nOh I'm in a bad state of mind\nCause you and I in a room\nIs a bad combination\nAnd any call after two\nIs a bad conversation\nAnd it's all gas, cut the breaks\nDrinking late at degenerate rates\nCalling out to God to give me a sign\nCause I'm in a bad state of mind\nOh I'm in a bad state of mind\n\n#TreatyOakRevival #BadStateOfMind",

Well don't act like you're surprised\nDays keep adding up, finding ways to still feel young\nFighting back them heavy hands of time\nSo you can lay your cards down, if you want to\nCause the dealer has the winning hand, and you were born to lose\nGood is what you want to be, but that's a side you'll never see\nCause fuckin' ups way easier to do\nYeah that sounds pretty on brand for you\nFor you\nCause you and I in a room\nIs a bad combination\nAny call after two\nIs a bad conversation\nAnd it's all gas, cut the breaks\nDrinking late at degenerate rates\nCalling out to God to give me a sign\nCause I'm in a bad state of mind\nOh I'm in a bad state of mind\nCause you and I in a room\nIs a bad combination\nAnd any call after two\nIs a bad conversation\nAnd it's all gas, cut the breaks\nDrinking late at degenerate rates\nCalling out to God to give me a sign\nCause I'm in a bad state of mind\nOh I'm in a bad state of mind\n\n#TreatyOakRevival #BadStateOfMind"

Watch the new trailer now and see the movie only in theaters April 25. #Accountant2\n\nChristian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has a talent for solving complex problems. When an old acquaintance is murdered, leaving behind a cryptic message to “find the accountant,” Wolff is compelled to solve the case. Realizing more extreme measures are necessary, Wolff recruits his estranged and highly lethal brother, Brax (Jon Bernthal), to help. In partnership with U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), they uncover a deadly conspiracy, becoming targets of a ruthless network of killers who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets buried.\n\nAbout Amazon MGM Studios: Amazon MGM (Metro Goldwyn Mayer) is a leading entertainment company focused on the production and global distribution of film and television content across all platforms.

In this video we get a shipment of steel coils then cut the steel so it can be pressed into the shapes for a drawer and for the tool box itself. Then the metal is welded together to create the main structure of the box and each individual drawers. Finally the box and drawers goes to paint which uses an electrophoresis coating which is better than powder coating. And then on the final assembly line, the drawers are mounted into the box and it's all packaged and shipped out to a store near you.\n\nThe Tool Box we made: https://www.craftsman.com/products/cmst98273rb\n\nHow Brake Pads are Made: https://youtu.be/H1WXlHONorw\n\n0:00 My New Garage\n1:22 Craftsman Factory\n2:29 Delivery of the Raw Steel\n4:51 Stamping the Sheet Metal\n6:38 Roll Forming the Front of the Drawer\n7:55 Brake Bending the Metal\n8:59 Welding the Drawer Together\n9:54 Building the Main Box\n13:09 Painting the Tool Box\n16:07 Assembling and Packing the Tool Box\n18:49 Delivery of my Tool Box\n\nThank you @craftsman  and all the factory workers for making this possible!\n→ Become a ChrisFix Subscriber: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7\n→ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit\n→ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8\n→ Website: http://www.ChrisFixed.com\n→ My Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix\n\n**If the video was helpful, remember to give it a \"thumbs up\" and consider subscribing.**\n\nDisclaimer:\nDue to factors beyond the control of ChrisFix, I cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \n\nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \n\nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\nhttps://www.welcometoberk.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon",

Generation, der sein Leben damit verbracht hat, auf dem Bauernhof seiner Familie anzubauen, zu arbeiten und zu lernen. Sein Witz und sein trockener Sinn für Humor sprechen Kinder und Erwachsene gleichermaßen an. Als Produkt der Millennial-Generation verbindet sich seine Wertschätzung für neue Technologien mit seiner altmodischen Arbeitsmoral und er verfügt über die einzigartige Fähigkeit, seine Botschaft auf eine Weise zu vermitteln, die sowohl bei langjährigen Landwirten als auch bei jenen Anklang findet, die keine Ahnung von Landwirtschaft haben. Angesichts des wachsenden Bewusstseins der Verbraucher darüber, woher ihre Lebensmittel kommen, hat Zach erkannt, dass eine unabhängige Stimme aus der Landwirtschaftsbranche erforderlich ist. Zach fördert aktiv die Landwirtschaft, indem er seine täglichen Erfahrungen in der Landwirtschaftswelt teilt und gleichzeitig Landwirt für Landwirt Bildung vermittelt, um einen gemeinsamen Dialog zwischen Landwirten und der Öffentlichkeit zu ermöglichen. \nFolgen Sie uns \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nBearbeitet von: Becky Johnson"

This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",
