Guided by the most powerful of sorcerers, Satoru Gojo, Itadori is admitted to Tokyo Jujutsu High School, an organization that fights the curses... and thus begins the heroic tale of a boy who became a curse to exorcise a curse, a life from which he could never turn back.\n\nABOUT CRUNCHYROLL\nCrunchyroll is the place to watch all your favorite anime!

Amen. Amen. Amen\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nIf I'm a pagan of the good times\nMy lover's the sunlight\nTo keep the Goddess on my side\nShe demands a sacrifice\n\nDrain the whole sea\nGet something shiny\nSomething meaty for the main course\nThat's a fine-looking high horse\nWhat you got in the stable?\nWe've a lot of starving faithful\n\nThat looks tasty\nThat looks plenty\nThis is hungry work\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nNo Masters or Kings\nWhen the Ritual begins\nThere is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin\n\nIn the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene\nOnly then I am human\nOnly then I am clean\nOoh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n.........\n📧 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n💌 Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.portal.district.biz\n.........\n\n#hozier #takemetochurch #lyrics #7clouds",

One I can hold on to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't really need to look very much further\nI don't wanna have to go where you don't follow\nI won't hold it back again, this passion inside\nI can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide\nYour love, I'll remember forever\n\n[Chorus]\nBut don't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nDon't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me, no\nDon't walk away from me\nDon't you dare walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nIf I don't have you\n\n[Outro]\nYou\nIf I don't have you\nOh, you"

Esto no es casualidad… esto es el resultado de la presión real del público y del movimiento de Millo Gang.\n\nGracias por montarse y aportar su energía a este junte:\n@Arcangel  • @Austin-San   • @AlmightyTGCLII  • Lil Mighty  • @BabyRastaOficial  • Noriel • @yovngchimi_  • @ColdgameSlayter  • Warboy • @michaelflorees \n\nA los fanáticos que lo estaban esperando con paciencia: GRACIAS por el support, por el ruido en redes y por quedarse firmes. Este remix es de ustedes. Comenta desde qué país/ciudad estás y cuál verso te dejó en loop. \n\n🕊️ HOMENAJE / RESPETO (PERÚ)🕊️\nCon mucho respeto, este remix también reconoce el apoyo de Perú y rinde homenaje al equipo de Franco Danós (QEPD). @FrancoDanxs  hizo su propia versión, la soltó en YouTube y Perú nos dio un respaldo inmenso. Gracias a su equipo por el release y por sumar al movimiento. Descansa en paz, Franco. 🇵🇪\n\nSPOTIFY (ARTIST LINKS)\nBryant Myers: https://open.spotify.com/artist/6w9ToX5slZ4uIdmD17hJ3c\n\nArcángel: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SsVbpTthjScTS7U2hmr1X\n\nAustin San: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0TC8XvQTSQMh4beW43FsAH\n\nAlmighty: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3wEIpMCPqeYfOrgplz4RKC\n\nLil Mighty: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3dCmVUXIWLAiJfgvY79T8V\n\nBaby Rasta: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0GgyFUpOyzWDRDqx8FCTDN\n\nNoriel: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3RtNN1VnooWEn3KQk03DUL\n\nYOVNGCHIMI: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4aSlfXDn9R60UlbZEboBUy\n\nSlayter: https://open.spotify.com/artist/44cW3xznP61BXbu0e7fgxn\n\nWARBOY: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3eszK023T4RXDHzRiEulRN\n\nMichael Florees: https://open.spotify.com/artist/2gATjk9j2u50i0HmXZySZY\n\nFranco Danós: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FnwFBccu4zyV4KJ5ViiYO\n\n℗ 2025 La Familia/Rimas Entertainment LLC",

Alors que les divisions entre les équipes rivales des Avengers s'accentuent et que les frontières du multivers s'affaiblissent, Fatalis émerge de Latvérie, convaincu que l'univers lui-même est brisé et que l'héroïsme fondé sur le sacrifice a échoué. Les événements qui suivent la mort de Tony Stark se répercutent, impliquant Reed Richards, Peter Parker et les Quatre Fantastiques, dont la tentative de contrer les desseins de Fatalis remet en question l'ordre naturel de la vie et de la mort. Face à un multivers sous tension, la vision de Fatalis, qui consiste à remodeler la réalité, se heurte aux conséquences morales de l'annulation du sacrifice, le menant inévitablement vers un conflit avec les idéaux mêmes qui ont jadis sauvé l'existence. La bande-annonce présente Doomsday comme une confrontation mesurée, centrée sur les personnages, qui redéfinit l'héroïsme, le pouvoir et ses conséquences, jetant les bases d'un règlement de comptes plus vaste qui culminera dans Secret Wars.\n\n— Abonnez-vous à Teaser Universe 🎬\n\n— Pour toute question : teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

                "description": "— Attention Viewers ⚠️\n— This is a Fan-Made Concept Trailer for:\n— Avengers: Doomsday - Tony Stark Will Return\n\n— This video is a fan-made concept trailer, created solely for artistic and entertainment purposes.The goal behind this trailer is to showcase my creativity and storytelling skills through a concept trailer based on a unique and original idea. By combining various effects, sound design, and AI technologies, I’ve crafted a cinematic experience that reimagines familiar worlds in bold and imaginative ways. This trailer is not official and is intended to entertain, inspire, and engage with the YouTube community. Thank you for your support — now let’s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. 🎬✨\n\n— In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story frames the beginning of the Multiverse Saga’s end by positioning Victor Von Doom as a philosophical and existential counter to the Avengers’ legacy of sacrifice. As fractures between competing Avengers teams deepen and the boundaries of the multiverse weaken, Doom emerges from Latveria with a conviction that the universe itself is broken, believing that heroism built on loss has failed. The events following Tony Stark’s death ripple outward, drawing in Reed Richards, Peter Parker, and the Fantastic Four, whose attempt to confront Doom’s designs challenges the natural order of life and death. With the multiverse under strain, Doom’s vision of reshaping reality collides with the moral consequences of undoing sacrifice, setting him on an inevitable path toward conflict with the very ideals that once saved existence. The trailer positions Doomsday as a measured, character-driven confrontation that reframes heroism, power, and consequence, laying the foundation for a larger reckoning that will culminate in Secret Wars.\n\n—  Subscribe to Teaser Universe 🎬\n—  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

                "description": "— Attenzione spettatori ⚠️\n— Questo è un concept trailer creato dai fan per:\n— Avengers: Doomsday - Tony Stark tornerà\n\n— Questo video è un concept trailer creato dai fan, esclusivamente a scopo artistico e di intrattenimento. L'obiettivo di questo trailer è quello di mostrare la mia creatività e le mie capacità narrative attraverso un concept trailer basato su un'idea unica e originale. Combinando vari effetti, sound design e tecnologie di intelligenza artificiale, ho creato un'esperienza cinematografica che reinventa mondi familiari in modi audaci e fantasiosi. Questo trailer non è ufficiale e ha lo scopo di intrattenere, ispirare e coinvolgere la community di YouTube. Grazie per il vostro supporto: ora immergiamoci in un mondo plasmato dalla creatività e dall'abilità. 🎬✨\n\n— In questo concept trailer di Avengers: Doomsday, la storia inquadra l'inizio della fine della Saga del Multiverso, posizionando Victor Von Doom come una controparte filosofica ed esistenziale all'eredità di sacrificio degli Avengers. Mentre le fratture tra i team di Avengers in competizione si aggravano e i confini del multiverso si indeboliscono, Destino emerge da Latveria con la convinzione che l'universo stesso sia in frantumi, convinto che l'eroismo costruito sulla perdita sia fallito. Gli eventi successivi alla morte di Tony Stark si espandono, coinvolgendo Reed Richards, Peter Parker e i Fantastici Quattro, il cui tentativo di affrontare i piani di Destino sfida l'ordine naturale della vita e della morte. Con il multiverso sotto pressione, la visione di Destino di rimodellare la realtà si scontra con le conseguenze morali dell'annullamento del sacrificio, portandolo su un percorso inevitabile verso il conflitto con gli stessi ideali che un tempo salvavano l'esistenza. Il trailer presenta Doomsday come un confronto misurato e incentrato sui personaggi che riformula eroismo, potere e conseguenze, gettando le basi per una resa dei conti più ampia che culminerà in Secret Wars.\n\n— Iscriviti a Teaser Universe 🎬\n— Per informazioni: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

Tujuan di balik trailer ini adalah untuk menampilkan kreativitas dan kemampuan bercerita saya melalui trailer konsep berdasarkan ide yang unik dan orisinal.

Terima kasih atas dukungan Anda — sekarang mari kita menyelami dunia yang dibentuk oleh kreativitas dan keahlian. 🎬✨\n\n— Dalam trailer konsep untuk Avengers: Doomsday ini, cerita membingkai awal akhir Saga Multiverse dengan memposisikan Victor Von Doom sebagai penyeimbang filosofis dan eksistensial terhadap warisan pengorbanan Avengers. Saat keretakan antara tim Avengers yang bersaing semakin dalam dan batas-batas multiverse melemah, Doom muncul dari Latveria dengan keyakinan bahwa alam semesta itu sendiri telah rusak, percaya bahwa kepahlawanan yang dibangun di atas kehilangan telah gagal. Peristiwa setelah kematian Tony Stark menyebar, melibatkan Reed Richards, Peter Parker, dan Fantastic Four, yang upayanya untuk menghadapi rencana Doom menantang tatanan alamiah hidup dan mati. Dengan multiverse yang berada di bawah tekanan, visi Doom untuk membentuk kembali realitas bertabrakan dengan konsekuensi moral dari membatalkan pengorbanan, menempatkannya pada jalan yang tak terhindarkan menuju konflik dengan cita-cita yang pernah menyelamatkan eksistensi. Trailer ini memposisikan Doomsday sebagai konfrontasi yang terukur dan berfokus pada karakter yang membingkai ulang kepahlawanan, kekuatan, dan konsekuensi, meletakkan dasar untuk perhitungan yang lebih besar yang akan berpuncak pada Secret Wars.\n\n— Berlangganan Teaser Universe 🎬\n— Untuk pertanyaan: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

                "description": "— Achtung, liebe Zuschauer ⚠️\n— Dies ist ein Fan-Konzepttrailer für:\n\n— Avengers: Doomsday – Tony Stark kehrt zurück\n\n— Dieses Video ist ein Fan-Konzepttrailer, der ausschließlich zu künstlerischen und Unterhaltungszwecken erstellt wurde. Ziel dieses Trailers ist es, meine Kreativität und mein erzählerisches Talent anhand einer einzigartigen und originellen Idee zu präsentieren. Durch die Kombination verschiedener Effekte, Sounddesign und KI-Technologien habe ich ein filmisches Erlebnis geschaffen, das bekannte Welten auf kühne und fantasievolle Weise neu interpretiert. Dieser Trailer ist nicht offiziell und soll die YouTube-Community unterhalten, inspirieren und zum Mitmachen anregen. Vielen Dank für eure Unterstützung – taucht ein in eine Welt voller Kreativität und Handwerkskunst. 🎬✨\n\n— In diesem Konzepttrailer für Avengers: Doomsday wird der Beginn des Endes der Multiversum-Saga eingeläutet, indem Victor Von Doom als philosophisches und existenzielles Gegenstück zum Vermächtnis der Avengers, dem Opfer, positioniert wird. Während sich die Gräben zwischen den rivalisierenden Avengers-Teams vertiefen und die Grenzen des Multiversums brüchig werden, taucht Doom aus Latveria auf, überzeugt davon, dass das Universum selbst zerbrochen ist. Er glaubt, dass Heldentum, das auf Verlust basiert, gescheitert ist. Die Ereignisse nach Tony Starks Tod breiten sich aus und ziehen Reed Richards, Peter Parker und die Fantastischen Vier mit hinein. Ihr Versuch, Dooms Plänen entgegenzutreten, stellt die natürliche Ordnung von Leben und Tod infrage. Angesichts des angespannten Multiversums kollidiert Dooms Vision, die Realität neu zu gestalten, mit den moralischen Konsequenzen der Aufhebung von Opfern. Dies führt ihn unweigerlich in den Konflikt mit jenen Idealen, die einst die Existenz retteten. Der Trailer präsentiert Doomsday als eine besonnene, charaktergetriebene Konfrontation, die Heldentum, Macht und Konsequenzen neu definiert und den Grundstein für eine größere Auseinandersetzung legt, die in den Secret Wars gipfeln wird.\n\n— Abonniere Teaser Universe 🎬\n— Anfragen: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

If they are sneaky about it, hiders may get caught where they were hiding before. Oh and when a Hider sees a SEEKER, they have to yell..... JELLYBEANS\nIf you want to play prop hunt with other pokemon players, join our discord: http://discord.gg/purplecliffe\n\nedited by: @bonstevawich \nthumbnail: @micahthebrave"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

            "description": "I Obtained Minecraft's God Armor\n\nI wanted to learn how to use the new spear in Minecraft and steal every spear on this server to craft a God spear. Can I master the spear using overpowered methods to steal them all and craft the God spear or I die and fail to conquer this Minecraft server?\n\nJoin My Minecraft Server!\nIP: play.freshsmp.fun\nPort: 19132\nDiscord Server: https://discord.gg/freshsmp\nTutorial (How to join): www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bx9YAsKRoA\n\nIf you're reading this and enjoyed the video please consider subscribing!\n\n\nThis was recorded on an unscripted Minecraft server called the FreshSMP, however, this particular video is scripted and the personas played in this video may be exaggerated for humor or scripted for storytelling purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ignore tags LOL)\nI played in a Minecraft SMP, or survival multiplayer server similar to SMP Earth, Dream SMP, or Lifesteal SMP (lifesteal smp season 2). Survival and PVP Minecraft content inspired by TommyInnit, Dream, Technoblade, Clownpierce, Rekrap2, Grian, and other Minecraft content creators. This a whitelisted lifesteal server.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nIn this minecraft video, I became IMMORTAL on this LIFESTEAL SMP. I did this on a copy of the Lifesteal SMP, also known as the deadliest minecraft server to exist, and it was super intense. The Lifesteal SMP features creators such as ClownPierce, PrinceZam, Leowook, Parrot, Spoke, roshambo, and more. This server also contains people like Parrot (also known as ParrotX2 or zParrot) and Spoke (also known as SpokeIsHere). This is similar to Parrot or ParrotX2 on the school SMP series where he started a war or ended a war or when Spoke Created 1000+ Iron Golems to Kill 1 Player in Survival Minecraft. This is also similar to how Spoke Broke 38 rules on this Minecraft SMP, or when he created an Illegal Minecraft Farm or an Illegal Minecraft Vault. \n\nWhat if there was a Minecraft Server where someone random made their own version of the Lifesteal SMP. Over the past few days, Here's How I Got ATTACKED On a Lifesteal SMP Copy... and it's known as a Lifesteal SMP Copy/Replica. This is a Minecraft Server where you could steal someone's hearts by ending them, and it's known as the Lifesteal SMP COPY.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Leowook,Roshambo,ClownPierce and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP/ LifeSteal SMP series/ Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nLike ParrotX2 videos and the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server Not like Dream SMP or Tommyinnit or Technoblade or any other Dream SMP members. This SMP is like LifeStealSMP and OneTrySMP, this is the hardest Minecraft Sever ever! and it is also a lore-based server in the MCYT community. I hope you enjoy this video, a true Minecraft hardcore server. Not only that, this server has the elements of school SMP and lifesteal SMP, but everything is Hardcore. This is a Hardcore SMP server\n\nLike Arcn and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft\n\n#freshlol #minecraft",

This a whitelisted lifesteal server.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War.

I did this on a copy of the Lifesteal SMP, also known as the deadliest minecraft server to exist, and it was super intense. The Lifesteal SMP features creators such as ClownPierce, PrinceZam, Leowook, Parrot, Spoke, roshambo, and more. This server also contains people like Parrot (also known as ParrotX2 or zParrot) and Spoke (also known as SpokeIsHere). This is similar to Parrot or ParrotX2 on the school SMP series where he started a war or ended a war or when Spoke Created 1000+ Iron Golems to Kill 1 Player in Survival Minecraft. This is also similar to how Spoke Broke 38 rules on this Minecraft SMP, or when he created an Illegal Minecraft Farm or an Illegal Minecraft Vault. \n\nWhat if there was a Minecraft Server where someone random made their own version of the Lifesteal SMP. Over the past few days, Here's How I Got ATTACKED On a Lifesteal SMP Copy... and it's known as a Lifesteal SMP Copy/Replica. This is a Minecraft Server where you could steal someone's hearts by ending them, and it's known as the Lifesteal SMP COPY.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Leowook,Roshambo,ClownPierce and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP/ LifeSteal SMP series/ Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nLike ParrotX2 videos and the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server Not like Dream SMP or Tommyinnit or Technoblade or any other Dream SMP members. This SMP is like LifeStealSMP and OneTrySMP, this is the hardest Minecraft Sever ever! and it is also a lore-based server in the MCYT community. I hope you enjoy this video, a true Minecraft hardcore server. Not only that, this server has the elements of school SMP and lifesteal SMP, but everything is Hardcore. This is a Hardcore SMP server\n\nLike Arcn and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft\n\n#freshlol #minecraft"
