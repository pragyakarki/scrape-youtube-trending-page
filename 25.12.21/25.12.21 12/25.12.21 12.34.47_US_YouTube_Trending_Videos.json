Amen. Amen. Amen\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nIf I'm a pagan of the good times\nMy lover's the sunlight\nTo keep the Goddess on my side\nShe demands a sacrifice\n\nDrain the whole sea\nGet something shiny\nSomething meaty for the main course\nThat's a fine-looking high horse\nWhat you got in the stable?\nWe've a lot of starving faithful\n\nThat looks tasty\nThat looks plenty\nThis is hungry work\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n\nNo Masters or Kings\nWhen the Ritual begins\nThere is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin\n\nIn the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene\nOnly then I am human\nOnly then I am clean\nOoh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen\n\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nGood God, let me give you my life\n.........\n📧 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n💌 Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.portal.district.biz\n.........\n\n#hozier #takemetochurch #lyrics #7clouds",

One I can hold on to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't really need to look very much further\nI don't wanna have to go where you don't follow\nI won't hold it back again, this passion inside\nI can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide\nYour love, I'll remember forever\n\n[Chorus]\nBut don't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nDon't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me, no\nDon't walk away from me\nDon't you dare walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nIf I don't have you\n\n[Outro]\nYou\nIf I don't have you\nOh, you"

            "description": "— Attention Viewers ⚠️\n— This is a Fan-Made Concept Trailer for:\n— Avengers: Doomsday - Tony Stark Will Return\n\n— This video is a fan-made concept trailer, created solely for artistic and entertainment purposes.The goal behind this trailer is to showcase my creativity and storytelling skills through a concept trailer based on a unique and original idea. By combining various effects, sound design, and AI technologies, I’ve crafted a cinematic experience that reimagines familiar worlds in bold and imaginative ways. This trailer is not official and is intended to entertain, inspire, and engage with the YouTube community. Thank you for your support — now let’s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. 🎬✨\n\n— In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story frames the beginning of the Multiverse Saga’s end by positioning Victor Von Doom as a philosophical and existential counter to the Avengers’ legacy of sacrifice. As fractures between competing Avengers teams deepen and the boundaries of the multiverse weaken, Doom emerges from Latveria with a conviction that the universe itself is broken, believing that heroism built on loss has failed. The events following Tony Stark’s death ripple outward, drawing in Reed Richards, Peter Parker, and the Fantastic Four, whose attempt to confront Doom’s designs challenges the natural order of life and death.

Alors que les divisions entre les équipes rivales des Avengers s'accentuent et que les frontières du multivers s'affaiblissent, Fatalis émerge de Latvérie, convaincu que l'univers lui-même est brisé et que l'héroïsme fondé sur le sacrifice a échoué. Les événements qui suivent la mort de Tony Stark se répercutent, impliquant Reed Richards, Peter Parker et les Quatre Fantastiques, dont la tentative de contrer les desseins de Fatalis remet en question l'ordre naturel de la vie et de la mort. Face à un multivers sous tension, la vision de Fatalis, qui consiste à remodeler la réalité, se heurte aux conséquences morales de l'annulation du sacrifice, le menant inévitablement vers un conflit avec les idéaux mêmes qui ont jadis sauvé l'existence. La bande-annonce présente Doomsday comme une confrontation mesurée, centrée sur les personnages, qui redéfinit l'héroïsme, le pouvoir et ses conséquences, jetant les bases d'un règlement de comptes plus vaste qui culminera dans Secret Wars.\n\n— Abonnez-vous à Teaser Universe 🎬\n\n— Pour toute question : teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

Während sich die Gräben zwischen den rivalisierenden Avengers-Teams vertiefen und die Grenzen des Multiversums brüchig werden, taucht Doom aus Latveria auf, überzeugt davon, dass das Universum selbst zerbrochen ist. Er glaubt, dass Heldentum, das auf Verlust basiert, gescheitert ist. Die Ereignisse nach Tony Starks Tod breiten sich aus und ziehen Reed Richards, Peter Parker und die Fantastischen Vier mit hinein.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Let’s go to war!\n\nBrettski stood just inside the casino doors, the air thick with recycled oxygen and false hope. The neon lights hummed like they were alive, buzzing louder than the thoughts in his head. He checked his phone one last time—bankroll balance glaring back at him like an accusation. Down almost fifty thousand dollars. One more bad night and it wasn’t “almost” anymore. It was official.\n\nHe told himself this was the last time. Not the last spin, not the last hand—*the last trip*. One final attempt to claw his way out before the story ended for good.\n\nHe sat at a blackjack table first. Conservative. Smart. Or so he thought. The cards came hot early—blackjack, double-down wins, a split that somehow paid twice. Chips stacked up fast. The pit boss started watching. Brettski felt the familiar rush creep in, that dangerous whisper saying, *You’re back. You’ve got this.*\n\nThen the deck turned cold.\n\nDealer twenty after twenty. Pushes that felt like losses. One brutal hand wiped out an hour of progress. Brettski stood up, jaw clenched, and walked away before the tilt swallowed him whole.\n\nSlots were screaming nearby. Against his better judgment, he fed the machine. Spin after spin. Dead. Dead. Dead. Then—bells exploded. A bonus round. His heart pounded as the screen lit up. The machine slowed… and paid just enough to keep him alive.\n\nNow it was roulette. One spin. Red or black. He stacked chips with shaking hands, pushing nearly everything he had left onto the felt. This was it. If it lost, the number would finally hit fifty thousand. No more “down almost.” Just *down*.\n\nThe dealer spun the wheel.\n\nThe ball bounced wildly, clattering from pocket to pocket.

                "description": "Join my Discord to hang out with me and our community! We also run a bunch of giveaways ONLY on Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nWe are BACK at the Casino with another episode of “Will Brettski smash his losing streak?” Only one way to find out, LETS GOOO! Thank you for watching! I appreciate each and everyone of you supporting me on this journey. Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nBrettski stood just inside the casino doors, the air thick with recycled oxygen and false hope. The neon lights hummed like they were alive, buzzing louder than the thoughts in his head. He checked his phone one last time—bankroll balance glaring back at him like an accusation. Down almost fifty thousand dollars. One more bad night and it wasn’t “almost” anymore. It was official.\n\nHe told himself this was the last time. Not the last spin, not the last hand—*the last trip*. One final attempt to claw his way out before the story ended for good.\n\nHe sat at a blackjack table first. Conservative. Smart. Or so he thought. The cards came hot early—blackjack, double-down wins, a split that somehow paid twice. Chips stacked up fast. The pit boss started watching. Brettski felt the familiar rush creep in, that dangerous whisper saying, *You’re back. You’ve got this.*\n\nThen the deck turned cold.\n\nDealer twenty after twenty. Pushes that felt like losses. One brutal hand wiped out an hour of progress. Brettski stood up, jaw clenched, and walked away before the tilt swallowed him whole.\n\nSlots were screaming nearby. Against his better judgment, he fed the machine. Spin after spin. Dead. Dead. Dead. Then—bells exploded. A bonus round. His heart pounded as the screen lit up. The machine slowed… and paid just enough to keep him alive.\n\nNow it was roulette. One spin. Red or black. He stacked chips with shaking hands, pushing nearly everything he had left onto the felt. This was it. If it lost, the number would finally hit fifty thousand. No more “down almost.” Just *down*.\n\nThe dealer spun the wheel.\n\nThe ball bounced wildly, clattering from pocket to pocket. Brettski leaned forward, breath held, as it slowed… slowed…\n\nAnd then the power cut out.\n\nThe casino went dark.\n\nThe wheel was still spinning.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

                "description": "I Obtained Minecraft's God Armor\n\nI wanted to learn how to use the new spear in Minecraft and steal every spear on this server to craft a God spear. Can I master the spear using overpowered methods to steal them all and craft the God spear or I die and fail to conquer this Minecraft server?\n\nJoin My Minecraft Server!\nIP: play.freshsmp.fun\nPort: 19132\nDiscord Server: https://discord.gg/freshsmp\nTutorial (How to join): www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bx9YAsKRoA\n\nIf you're reading this and enjoyed the video please consider subscribing!\n\n\nThis was recorded on an unscripted Minecraft server called the FreshSMP, however, this particular video is scripted and the personas played in this video may be exaggerated for humor or scripted for storytelling purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ignore tags LOL)\nI played in a Minecraft SMP, or survival multiplayer server similar to SMP Earth, Dream SMP, or Lifesteal SMP (lifesteal smp season 2). Survival and PVP Minecraft content inspired by TommyInnit, Dream, Technoblade, Clownpierce, Rekrap2, Grian, and other Minecraft content creators. This a whitelisted lifesteal server.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nIn this minecraft video, I became IMMORTAL on this LIFESTEAL SMP. I did this on a copy of the Lifesteal SMP, also known as the deadliest minecraft server to exist, and it was super intense. The Lifesteal SMP features creators such as ClownPierce, PrinceZam, Leowook, Parrot, Spoke, roshambo, and more. This server also contains people like Parrot (also known as ParrotX2 or zParrot) and Spoke (also known as SpokeIsHere). This is similar to Parrot or ParrotX2 on the school SMP series where he started a war or ended a war or when Spoke Created 1000+ Iron Golems to Kill 1 Player in Survival Minecraft. This is also similar to how Spoke Broke 38 rules on this Minecraft SMP, or when he created an Illegal Minecraft Farm or an Illegal Minecraft Vault. \n\nWhat if there was a Minecraft Server where someone random made their own version of the Lifesteal SMP. Over the past few days, Here's How I Got ATTACKED On a Lifesteal SMP Copy... and it's known as a Lifesteal SMP Copy/Replica. This is a Minecraft Server where you could steal someone's hearts by ending them, and it's known as the Lifesteal SMP COPY.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Leowook,Roshambo,ClownPierce and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP/ LifeSteal SMP series/ Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nLike ParrotX2 videos and the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server Not like Dream SMP or Tommyinnit or Technoblade or any other Dream SMP members. This SMP is like LifeStealSMP and OneTrySMP, this is the hardest Minecraft Sever ever! and it is also a lore-based server in the MCYT community. I hope you enjoy this video, a true Minecraft hardcore server. Not only that, this server has the elements of school SMP and lifesteal SMP, but everything is Hardcore. This is a Hardcore SMP server\n\nLike Arcn and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft\n\n#freshlol #minecraft"
