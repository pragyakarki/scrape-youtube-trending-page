Descansa en paz, Franco. 🇵🇪\n\nSPOTIFY (ARTIST LINKS)\nBryant Myers: https://open.spotify.com/artist/6w9ToX5slZ4uIdmD17hJ3c\n\nArcángel: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SsVbpTthjScTS7U2hmr1X\n\nAustin San: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0TC8XvQTSQMh4beW43FsAH\n\nAlmighty: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3wEIpMCPqeYfOrgplz4RKC\n\nLil Mighty: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3dCmVUXIWLAiJfgvY79T8V\n\nBaby Rasta: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0GgyFUpOyzWDRDqx8FCTDN\n\nNoriel: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3RtNN1VnooWEn3KQk03DUL\n\nYOVNGCHIMI: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4aSlfXDn9R60UlbZEboBUy\n\nSlayter: https://open.spotify.com/artist/44cW3xznP61BXbu0e7fgxn\n\nWARBOY: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3eszK023T4RXDHzRiEulRN\n\nMichael Florees: https://open.spotify.com/artist/2gATjk9j2u50i0HmXZySZY\n\nFranco Danós: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FnwFBccu4zyV4KJ5ViiYO\n\n℗ 2025 La Familia/Rimas Entertainment LLC"

El objetivo de este tráiler es mostrar mi creatividad y mis habilidades narrativas a través de un tráiler conceptual basado en una idea única y original. Al combinar diversos efectos, diseño de sonido y tecnologías de inteligencia artificial, he creado una experiencia cinematográfica que reinventa mundos familiares de formas audaces e imaginativas. Este tráiler no es oficial y su objetivo es entretener, inspirar e interactuar con la comunidad de YouTube. Gracias por su apoyo. Ahora, adentrémonos en un mundo moldeado por la creatividad y la artesanía. 🎬✨\n\n— En este tráiler conceptual de Avengers: Doomsday, la historia enmarca el comienzo y el final de la Saga del Multiverso al posicionar a Victor Von Doom como una contraposición filosófica y existencial al legado de sacrificio de los Vengadores. A medida que las fracturas entre los equipos de Vengadores rivales se profundizan y los límites del multiverso se debilitan, Doom emerge de Latveria con la convicción de que el universo mismo está roto, creyendo que el heroísmo basado en la pérdida ha fracasado. Los eventos posteriores a la muerte de Tony Stark se extienden, atrayendo a Reed Richards, Peter Parker y los Cuatro Fantásticos, cuyo intento de confrontar los designios de Doom desafía el orden natural de la vida y la muerte. Con el multiverso bajo presión, la visión de Doom de remodelar la realidad choca con las consecuencias morales de deshacer el sacrificio, lo que lo coloca en un camino inevitable hacia el conflicto con los mismos ideales que una vez salvaron la existencia. El tráiler presenta Doomsday como una confrontación mesurada, impulsada por los personajes, que replantea el heroísmo, el poder y las consecuencias, sentando las bases para un ajuste de cuentas mayor que culminará en Secret Wars.\n\n— Suscríbete a Teaser Universe 🎬\n— Para consultas: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

                "description": "— Attention spectateurs ⚠️\n\n— Ceci est une bande-annonce conceptuelle réalisée par un fan pour :\n\n— Avengers : Doomsday - Tony Stark sera de retour\n\n— Cette vidéo est une bande-annonce conceptuelle réalisée par un fan, créée uniquement à des fins artistiques et de divertissement. L'objectif est de mettre en valeur ma créativité et mes compétences narratives à travers une bande-annonce conceptuelle basée sur une idée unique et originale. En combinant divers effets spéciaux, une conception sonore soignée et des technologies d'intelligence artificielle, j'ai créé une expérience cinématographique qui réinvente des univers familiers de manière audacieuse et imaginative. Cette bande-annonce n'est pas officielle et vise à divertir, inspirer et interagir avec la communauté YouTube. Merci pour votre soutien ! Plongeons maintenant dans un monde façonné par la créativité et le savoir-faire. 🎬✨\n\n— Dans cette bande-annonce conceptuelle pour Avengers : Doomsday, l'histoire amorce la fin de la Saga du Multivers en présentant Victor Von Doom comme une alternative philosophique et existentielle à l'héritage de sacrifice des Avengers. Alors que les divisions entre les équipes rivales des Avengers s'accentuent et que les frontières du multivers s'affaiblissent, Fatalis émerge de Latvérie, convaincu que l'univers lui-même est brisé et que l'héroïsme fondé sur le sacrifice a échoué. Les événements qui suivent la mort de Tony Stark se répercutent, impliquant Reed Richards, Peter Parker et les Quatre Fantastiques, dont la tentative de contrer les desseins de Fatalis remet en question l'ordre naturel de la vie et de la mort. Face à un multivers sous tension, la vision de Fatalis, qui consiste à remodeler la réalité, se heurte aux conséquences morales de l'annulation du sacrifice, le menant inévitablement vers un conflit avec les idéaux mêmes qui ont jadis sauvé l'existence. La bande-annonce présente Doomsday comme une confrontation mesurée, centrée sur les personnages, qui redéfinit l'héroïsme, le pouvoir et ses conséquences, jetant les bases d'un règlement de comptes plus vaste qui culminera dans Secret Wars.\n\n— Abonnez-vous à Teaser Universe 🎬\n\n— Pour toute question : teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

                "description": "— Achtung, liebe Zuschauer ⚠️\n— Dies ist ein Fan-Konzepttrailer für:\n\n— Avengers: Doomsday – Tony Stark kehrt zurück\n\n— Dieses Video ist ein Fan-Konzepttrailer, der ausschließlich zu künstlerischen und Unterhaltungszwecken erstellt wurde. Ziel dieses Trailers ist es, meine Kreativität und mein erzählerisches Talent anhand einer einzigartigen und originellen Idee zu präsentieren. Durch die Kombination verschiedener Effekte, Sounddesign und KI-Technologien habe ich ein filmisches Erlebnis geschaffen, das bekannte Welten auf kühne und fantasievolle Weise neu interpretiert. Dieser Trailer ist nicht offiziell und soll die YouTube-Community unterhalten, inspirieren und zum Mitmachen anregen. Vielen Dank für eure Unterstützung – taucht ein in eine Welt voller Kreativität und Handwerkskunst. 🎬✨\n\n— In diesem Konzepttrailer für Avengers: Doomsday wird der Beginn des Endes der Multiversum-Saga eingeläutet, indem Victor Von Doom als philosophisches und existenzielles Gegenstück zum Vermächtnis der Avengers, dem Opfer, positioniert wird. Während sich die Gräben zwischen den rivalisierenden Avengers-Teams vertiefen und die Grenzen des Multiversums brüchig werden, taucht Doom aus Latveria auf, überzeugt davon, dass das Universum selbst zerbrochen ist. Er glaubt, dass Heldentum, das auf Verlust basiert, gescheitert ist. Die Ereignisse nach Tony Starks Tod breiten sich aus und ziehen Reed Richards, Peter Parker und die Fantastischen Vier mit hinein. Ihr Versuch, Dooms Plänen entgegenzutreten, stellt die natürliche Ordnung von Leben und Tod infrage. Angesichts des angespannten Multiversums kollidiert Dooms Vision, die Realität neu zu gestalten, mit den moralischen Konsequenzen der Aufhebung von Opfern. Dies führt ihn unweigerlich in den Konflikt mit jenen Idealen, die einst die Existenz retteten. Der Trailer präsentiert Doomsday als eine besonnene, charaktergetriebene Konfrontation, die Heldentum, Macht und Konsequenzen neu definiert und den Grundstein für eine größere Auseinandersetzung legt, die in den Secret Wars gipfeln wird.\n\n— Abonniere Teaser Universe 🎬\n— Anfragen: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

Peristiwa setelah kematian Tony Stark menyebar, melibatkan Reed Richards, Peter Parker, dan Fantastic Four, yang upayanya untuk menghadapi rencana Doom menantang tatanan alamiah hidup dan mati.

This trailer is not official and is intended to entertain, inspire, and engage with the YouTube community. Thank you for your support — now let’s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. 🎬✨\n\n— In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story frames the beginning of the Multiverse Saga’s end by positioning Victor Von Doom as a philosophical and existential counter to the Avengers’ legacy of sacrifice. As fractures between competing Avengers teams deepen and the boundaries of the multiverse weaken, Doom emerges from Latveria with a conviction that the universe itself is broken, believing that heroism built on loss has failed. The events following Tony Stark’s death ripple outward, drawing in Reed Richards, Peter Parker, and the Fantastic Four, whose attempt to confront Doom’s designs challenges the natural order of life and death. With the multiverse under strain, Doom’s vision of reshaping reality collides with the moral consequences of undoing sacrifice, setting him on an inevitable path toward conflict with the very ideals that once saved existence. The trailer positions Doomsday as a measured, character-driven confrontation that reframes heroism, power, and consequence, laying the foundation for a larger reckoning that will culminate in Secret Wars.\n\n—  Subscribe to Teaser Universe 🎬\n—  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

The gameplay by default is first person, but players have the option to play in third person mode. The core gameplay revolves around breaking and placing blocks. The game world is essentially composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes—that are arranged in a fixed grid pattern and represent different materials, such as dirt, stone, various ores, water, and tree trunks. While players can move freely across the world, objects and items can only be placed at fixed locations relative to the grid. Players can gather these material blocks and place them elsewhere, thus allowing for various constructions.\n\n#Checkpoint #Minecraft"

            "description": "I Obtained Minecraft's God Armor\n\nI wanted to learn how to use the new spear in Minecraft and steal every spear on this server to craft a God spear. Can I master the spear using overpowered methods to steal them all and craft the God spear or I die and fail to conquer this Minecraft server?\n\nJoin My Minecraft Server!\nIP: play.freshsmp.fun\nPort: 19132\nDiscord Server: https://discord.gg/freshsmp\nTutorial (How to join): www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bx9YAsKRoA\n\nIf you're reading this and enjoyed the video please consider subscribing!\n\n\nThis was recorded on an unscripted Minecraft server called the FreshSMP, however, this particular video is scripted and the personas played in this video may be exaggerated for humor or scripted for storytelling purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ignore tags LOL)\nI played in a Minecraft SMP, or survival multiplayer server similar to SMP Earth, Dream SMP, or Lifesteal SMP (lifesteal smp season 2). Survival and PVP Minecraft content inspired by TommyInnit, Dream, Technoblade, Clownpierce, Rekrap2, Grian, and other Minecraft content creators. This a whitelisted lifesteal server.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nIn this minecraft video, I became IMMORTAL on this LIFESTEAL SMP. I did this on a copy of the Lifesteal SMP, also known as the deadliest minecraft server to exist, and it was super intense. The Lifesteal SMP features creators such as ClownPierce, PrinceZam, Leowook, Parrot, Spoke, roshambo, and more. This server also contains people like Parrot (also known as ParrotX2 or zParrot) and Spoke (also known as SpokeIsHere). This is similar to Parrot or ParrotX2 on the school SMP series where he started a war or ended a war or when Spoke Created 1000+ Iron Golems to Kill 1 Player in Survival Minecraft. This is also similar to how Spoke Broke 38 rules on this Minecraft SMP, or when he created an Illegal Minecraft Farm or an Illegal Minecraft Vault. \n\nWhat if there was a Minecraft Server where someone random made their own version of the Lifesteal SMP. Over the past few days, Here's How I Got ATTACKED On a Lifesteal SMP Copy... and it's known as a Lifesteal SMP Copy/Replica. This is a Minecraft Server where you could steal someone's hearts by ending them, and it's known as the Lifesteal SMP COPY.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Leowook,Roshambo,ClownPierce and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP/ LifeSteal SMP series/ Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nLike ParrotX2 videos and the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server Not like Dream SMP or Tommyinnit or Technoblade or any other Dream SMP members. This SMP is like LifeStealSMP and OneTrySMP, this is the hardest Minecraft Sever ever! and it is also a lore-based server in the MCYT community. I hope you enjoy this video, a true Minecraft hardcore server. Not only that, this server has the elements of school SMP and lifesteal SMP, but everything is Hardcore. This is a Hardcore SMP server\n\nLike Arcn and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft\n\n#freshlol #minecraft",

Survival and PVP Minecraft content inspired by TommyInnit, Dream, Technoblade, Clownpierce, Rekrap2, Grian, and other Minecraft content creators. This a whitelisted lifesteal server.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nIn this minecraft video, I became IMMORTAL on this LIFESTEAL SMP. I did this on a copy of the Lifesteal SMP, also known as the deadliest minecraft server to exist, and it was super intense. The Lifesteal SMP features creators such as ClownPierce, PrinceZam, Leowook, Parrot, Spoke, roshambo, and more. This server also contains people like Parrot (also known as ParrotX2 or zParrot) and Spoke (also known as SpokeIsHere). This is similar to Parrot or ParrotX2 on the school SMP series where he started a war or ended a war or when Spoke Created 1000+ Iron Golems to Kill 1 Player in Survival Minecraft. This is also similar to how Spoke Broke 38 rules on this Minecraft SMP, or when he created an Illegal Minecraft Farm or an Illegal Minecraft Vault. \n\nWhat if there was a Minecraft Server where someone random made their own version of the Lifesteal SMP. Over the past few days, Here's How I Got ATTACKED On a Lifesteal SMP Copy... and it's known as a Lifesteal SMP Copy/Replica. This is a Minecraft Server where you could steal someone's hearts by ending them, and it's known as the Lifesteal SMP COPY.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Leowook,Roshambo,ClownPierce and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP/ LifeSteal SMP series/ Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nLike ParrotX2 videos and the LifeSteal SMP, a Minecraft Server Not like Dream SMP or Tommyinnit or Technoblade or any other Dream SMP members. This SMP is like LifeStealSMP and OneTrySMP, this is the hardest Minecraft Sever ever! and it is also a lore-based server in the MCYT community. I hope you enjoy this video, a true Minecraft hardcore server. Not only that, this server has the elements of school SMP and lifesteal SMP, but everything is Hardcore. This is a Hardcore SMP server\n\nLike Arcn and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft\n\n#freshlol #minecraft"
