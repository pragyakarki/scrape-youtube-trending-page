            "description": "Maia Stern | July 17, 2024\nTrey Anastasio is no stranger to the Tiny Desk, having performed a solo set in 2015. Bassist Mike Gordon and drummer Jon Fishman also performed for our Tiny Desk (home) concert series in 2020 with guitarist Leo Kottke. And now, finally, we get a full Phish Tiny Desk concert.\n\nThe set began with “Sigma Oasis,” which included a little musical reference to the All Things Considered theme song. The band continued with “Evolve,” a track from its 16th studio album released last week. Before the band’s final song, Anastasio and Gordon warmed up their fingers on tiny trampolines, which likely had the uninitiated scratching their heads. But for fans of this band, it was a clear signal of what was coming next: “You Enjoy Myself,” a song that dates back to the band’s beginnings and can safely be called a Phish classic. In live performances, the jam segment features choreographed bouncing, and the band brought that spectacle right into our office.\n\nAfter, the band ended its set and swerved out slowly through the crowd, singing while giving out high fives. But the audience's applause didn’t stop, so Phish came back out and played two bonus tracks: “Sample in a Jar” and “Chalk Dust Torture.” “When we started the band, we used to practice in a room exactly this size… it was probably smaller,” Anastasio shared. What a gift to get to watch Phish perform in a similarly sized room 41 years later.\n\nSET LIST\n“Sigma Oasis”\n“Evolve”\n“You Enjoy Myself”\n“Sample in a Jar”\n“Chalk Dust Torture”\n\nMUSICIANS\nTrey Anastasio: guitar, lead vocals\nMike Gordon:  bass, vocals\nJon Fishman: drums, vocals\nPage McConnell: keys, vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer/Director: Maia Stern \nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

            "description": "Gervonta “Tank” Davis may not only be the face of boxing, he might also be the world’s best fighter. Davis delivered yet another viral moment, successfully defending his WBA Lightweight World Title by knocking out the previously unbeaten Frank “The Ghost” Martin with a vicious left hand at 1:29 of the eighth round in the PBC Pay-Per-View main event on Prime Video Saturday night, which marked the 100th championship fight night at the historic MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nFighting in his first world title bout, Martin delivered a high-level performance. Davis (30-0, 28 KOs), however, showed once again that he is indeed special.\n \n“Thank you guys for coming out, great event. I appreciate everyone who made this possible. We did it once again. On to the next!” said Davis.\n \nA packed house full of 13,249 were on-hand to witness a masterful performance from Davis. Martin (18-1, 12 KOs) used quick combinations and elite athleticism to bank the early rounds. Davis took his time, opening up in the third round and constantly pinning Martin against the ropes.\n \n“Frank Martin was a great fighter. He put up a good four to five rounds,” said Davis. “I was finding my range. (Martin) had a decent jab and was moving a lot and I just had to break him down as the fight went on.”\n \nThe undefeated three-division world champion applied steady, intelligent pressure, slowly breaking Martin down and setting him up for the highlight-reel finish in the eighth. With Martin backed into a corner, Davis rocked him with a powerful left uppercut followed by a left cross that left Martin flat on his back. As Martin struggled to rise, referee Harvey Dock wisely waved the fight off.\n \n“I knew he wasn’t getting back up because of the way he fell, and I knew he was gonna tire himself out, that was the whole gameplan,” said Davis.\n \n“I’m holding my head high,” said Martin. “At the end of the day, I came out to be great, but I came up short. I got caught with a shot that I didn’t see, one of those shots that comes from underneath and it went from there. I guess I didn’t make the count, but I appreciate everybody that came out, everybody that’s been a part of this event.\n \n“I’ll be back. Going to go watch the film, get better and grow. Y’all will see me again.”\n \nDavis has similar plans. “Now we go back to the drawing board and I want to fight all of them.”\n\n#TankMartin #GervontaDavis #FrankMartin \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

Get some jobs from the neighborhood and gain a humble income. Start a company of up to 4 people and divide the work by authorizing them in various topics.\n\nBring Your Design to Life\nPurchase a land. Design a house. Build it. Decorate with individual touches and bring out your inner designer. Sell it at an auction. The\nland is all yours. You decide.\n\nCO-OP In A Open-world simulator\nEver imagined starting a company with your friends? Of course, you can manage the entire process alone but it's always funnier with friends trolling you. (Well, not pretty sure about this one.) One of you is CEO and s/he has the control over your authorization. So, if you cannot purchase a land or take a loan from bank, it's best to talk to your CEO before writing your totally kind wishes at our Discord Server. (Or we can talk to your CEO on your behalf, that's also a solution.)\n\nChill\nHow much relief can a sledgehammer bring? Try! Demolish a big house with a sledgehammer. Or clean a real big houses. (You don't even clean your own room? Let's keep it a secret. No one should know you‘ll clean a whole mansion online.)\n\nUpgrade Your Skills\nYou gain skill points as you get experienced and can decide which skills or tools that you want to focus on. Having colleagues specialize in different subjects can make your job even easier.\n\nLogistics\nNot all ways to make money are that difficult. You can just put some into your pocket by delivering cargo. But be careful, you'll be carrying different types of them.\n\nMake a Contract\nYou (and your company) work by contracts. These contracts may include decoration, demolish, build, logistics jobs or some of them together",

Start a company of up to 4 people and divide the work by authorizing them in various topics.\n\nBring Your Design to Life\nPurchase a land. Design a house. Build it. Decorate with individual touches and bring out your inner designer. Sell it at an auction. The\nland is all yours. You decide.\n\nCO-OP In A Open-world simulator\nEver imagined starting a company with your friends? Of course, you can manage the entire process alone but it's always funnier with friends trolling you. (Well, not pretty sure about this one.) One of you is CEO and s/he has the control over your authorization. So, if you cannot purchase a land or take a loan from bank, it's best to talk to your CEO before writing your totally kind wishes at our Discord Server. (Or we can talk to your CEO on your behalf, that's also a solution.)\n\nChill\nHow much relief can a sledgehammer bring? Try! Demolish a big house with a sledgehammer. Or clean a real big houses. (You don't even clean your own room? Let's keep it a secret. No one should know you‘ll clean a whole mansion online.)\n\nUpgrade Your Skills\nYou gain skill points as you get experienced and can decide which skills or tools that you want to focus on. Having colleagues specialize in different subjects can make your job even easier.\n\nLogistics\nNot all ways to make money are that difficult. You can just put some into your pocket by delivering cargo. But be careful, you'll be carrying different types of them.\n\nMake a Contract\nYou (and your company) work by contracts. These contracts may include decoration, demolish, build, logistics jobs or some of them together"

            "description": "Let’s settle the debate on regular pavement and VHT: which is the quickest accelerating American car in history, the Dodge Challenger SRT Demom 170 or the Lucid Air Sapphire?\n\n=\nThis episode is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nIn this episode, we race the two most powerful American production cars in history, the 1234-hp Lucid Air Sapphire and the 1025-hp Dodge Challenger SRT D170.\n\nThe first race takes place on regular asphalt, with our standard weather-corrected numbers. With the help of veteran drag racer, we achieve the quickest 0-60 and ¼-mile times ever seen from a Challenger. But is that enough to beat the Sapphire?\n\nEither way, the Demon’s Mickey Thompson drag radials aren’t meant for an unprepped surface, so we leave Willow Springs and head to the Famoso Drag Strip to race on “glue” — the VHT-prepped surface. \n\nHere, Tom Bailey’s experience launching the Challenger pays dividends as we try to recreate Dodge’s claimed 8.91-second quarter-mile run and dethrone the Lucid. Will it work?\n\nLet’s fight about it.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 America Divided: ICE vs EV\n1:16 The Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 Specs\n2:43 The Lucid Air Sapphire Specs\n4:21 Asphalt Race: Demon 170 vs Lucid Sapphire\n5:04 Drag Race Replay: What Happened?\n8:53 Results and Willow Springs Conclusion\n9:27 Moving to Famoso Drag Strip\n9:42 What is VHT?\n10:29 What is Rollout?\n11:07 How do the Timing Lights Work?\n12:55 Demon vs Sapphire race on VHT\n14:53 Conclusion and Results\n\n===\n\nPerformance Testing Results: \n\nLucid Air Sapphire\n0-60: 2.1 seconds\n¼-mile: 9.2 sec @ 158 mph\n\nDodge Challenger SRT Demon 170\n0-60: 3.7 seconds\n¼-mile: 11.2 sec @ 139 mph\n\n\nVHT Prepped Surface Results:\nLucid Air Sapphire: 9.002 sec @ 155.57 mph (0-60 in 1.92 sec)\nDodge SRT Demon 170: 9.721 sec @ 143.72 mph",
