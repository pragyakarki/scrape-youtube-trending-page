This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, instead of multiple hunters. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. I'm excited to see how this goes over the coming months.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. \n\nThe TITAN theme music is custom scored by Dream & PmBata. Will hopefully be custom sound tracking all the future videos so anyone can feel free to react! (this has two non-custom songs in it, but not during the hunt)\n\nIf this video somehow gets 1,000,000 likes we'll announce the date of the next episode early.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.

Con goles de Yerson Mosquera y James Rodríguez de un polémico penal, los Cafeteros se quedaron con los tres puntos ante la Albiceleste, que había empatado transitoriamente en los pies de Nicolás González.\n\nEn un primer tiempo parejo, con poco juego pero varias llegadas, fueron los de Néstor Lorenzo los que abrieron el marcador a través de la pelota parada. Jugaron corto un córner, James metió un centro pasado y Yerson Mosquera apareció por el segundo palo para empujarla de cabeza. En el arranque del complemento, llegó la respuesta de los de Lionel Scaloni: Nicolás González la robó en mitad de cancha, se sacó a un defensor de encima y definió cruzado ante la salida de Camilo Vargas.\n\nPara más información, visitá http://www.tycsports.com",

Life as you know it can change in an instant and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters and road unknown.\n\nThe cancer journey is complex, scary and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you.\n\nWith humility, it also brings you face to face with your own vulnerabilities in a way you have never considered before, and with that, a new perspective on everything.\n\nThis time has above all reminded William and me to reflect and be grateful for the simple yet important things in life, which so many of us often take for granted. Of simply loving and being loved. \n\nDoing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus. Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes.\n\nI am however looking forward to being back at work and undertaking a few more public engagements in the coming months when I can.\n\nDespite all that has gone before I enter this new phase of recovery with a renewed sense of hope and appreciation of life.\n\nWilliam and I are so grateful for the support we have received and have drawn great strength from all those who are helping us at this time. Everyone’s kindness, empathy and compassion has been truly humbling.\n\nTo all those who are continuing their own cancer journey – I remain with you, side by side, hand in hand.

Thank you to Ritual for Sponsoring this video. Get 25% OFF your first month Go to https://ritual.com/eamonbec25 💕👌🏻\n\nEamon first proposed in February of 2017 while we were on a safari in Tanzania. It was easily one of the best days of our lives! Elephants, cheetahs and an engagement overlooking the Serengetti at sunset 🥰 . But, with so many exciting business ventures and travel ideas on our minds we made the decision to postpone the actually wedding until we were a little less busy. And then, we never stopped being really, really busy 😂 . Add in a global pandemic and a cancer diagnosis it just never felt like the right time. We're so excited to say that NOW actually feels like the RIGHT time!! We need your help!! Are you in the wedding industry in the areas of Ottawa, Kingston, or even Toronto? Do you have a food truck? Get in touch at our email -- hello@eamonandbec.com \n\nWe'd love to hear your ideas in the comments below! This is going to be one epic party 💜 \n\nThanks to our friends featured in this episode for being the absolute BEST. \n@MaxandOccy @kingingit \n\nRitual disclosure: *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

                "description": "After 11 years together, 7 years engaged, two van conversions, a cabin renovation and a baby, *IT* is finally happening 👰‍♀️🤵!! Thank you to Ritual for Sponsoring this video. Get 25% OFF your first month Go to https://ritual.com/eamonbec25 💕👌🏻\n\nEamon first proposed in February of 2017 while we were on a safari in Tanzania. It was easily one of the best days of our lives! Elephants, cheetahs and an engagement overlooking the Serengetti at sunset 🥰 . But, with so many exciting business ventures and travel ideas on our minds we made the decision to postpone the actually wedding until we were a little less busy. And then, we never stopped being really, really busy 😂 . Add in a global pandemic and a cancer diagnosis it just never felt like the right time. We're so excited to say that NOW actually feels like the RIGHT time!! We need your help!! Are you in the wedding industry in the areas of Ottawa, Kingston, or even Toronto? Do you have a food truck? Get in touch at our email -- hello@eamonandbec.com \n\nWe'd love to hear your ideas in the comments below! This is going to be one epic party 💜 \n\nThanks to our friends featured in this episode for being the absolute BEST. \n@MaxandOccy @kingingit \n\nRitual disclosure: *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

            "description": "Learn to fly 2 is one of the greatest flash games ever. If you were to make a flash game tier list this is easily one of the best. Despite releasing in 2011 and flash player ending learn 2 fly is actually still an actively played game with a brilliant speedrunning community. \n\nOne of my favourite YouTubers EazySpeezy even managed to set a great speedrunning time in the game completing the entire thing on day 9. I however am the Spiffing Brit and whilst others play fair. I want to destroy the Ballance of every game I play. That is why today you will be watching a penguin go faster than the speed of sound. Faster than the speed of light and in fact faster than the game can even comprehend. \n\nI hope you all enjoy the show!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\n\nTitle: Can I Use Exploits To Beat Speedrunners? - Learn To Fly 2 IS PERFECTLY BALANCED\n\n#game #flashgame #speedrun",

I however am the Spiffing Brit and whilst others play fair. I want to destroy the Ballance of every game I play. That is why today you will be watching a penguin go faster than the speed of sound. Faster than the speed of light and in fact faster than the game can even comprehend. \n\nI hope you all enjoy the show!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage.
