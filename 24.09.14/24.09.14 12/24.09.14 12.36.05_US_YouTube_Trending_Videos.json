When his bloodthirsty urges can’t be ignored any longer, Dexter must learn to channel his inner darkness. With the guidance of his father, Harry (Golden Globe® winner Christian Slater), he adopts a Code designed to help him find and kill people who deserve to be eliminated from society without getting on law enforcement’s radar. This is a particular challenge for young Dexter as he begins a forensics internship at the Miami Metro Police Department. Patrick Dempsey, Molly Brown, James Martinez, Christina Milian, Alex Shimizu, Reno Wilson and special guest star, Sarah Michelle Gellar also star in this new series, with Michael C. Hall returning to voice the iconic inner monologue in Dexter Morgan’s head.

                "description": "Set in 1991 Miami, Dexter: Original Sin follows Dexter (Patrick Gibson) as he transitions from student to avenging serial killer. When his bloodthirsty urges can’t be ignored any longer, Dexter must learn to channel his inner darkness. With the guidance of his father, Harry (Golden Globe® winner Christian Slater), he adopts a Code designed to help him find and kill people who deserve to be eliminated from society without getting on law enforcement’s radar. This is a particular challenge for young Dexter as he begins a forensics internship at the Miami Metro Police Department. Patrick Dempsey, Molly Brown, James Martinez, Christina Milian, Alex Shimizu, Reno Wilson and special guest star, Sarah Michelle Gellar also star in this new series, with Michael C. Hall returning to voice the iconic inner monologue in Dexter Morgan’s head. Witness the beginning as Dexter’s darkness first comes to light in DEXTER: ORIGINAL SIN, streaming Friday, December 13 with the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME® plan.\n\n#Dexter #Showtime #ParamountPlus\n\nParamount+ is here!

Use code TREE for $20 off your first SeatGeek order. https://seatgeek.onelink.me/RrnK/TREE\n\nGod bless the NFL season, for it will consume us whole with drama and tension alike. May the games be spectacles and may our teams not get wrecked by injury and impotence alike. The NFL is king, and we will feast on the droppings that fall to us from its sweet, sweet table.\n\nThis video is dedicated to Week One of the happenings in the league. This is going to be an MCU feature by the end of the year. I can feel it.\n\nYes, this year is going to kill me. Thanks for asking.",

Use code TREE for $20 off your first SeatGeek order. https://seatgeek.onelink.me/RrnK/TREE\n\nGod bless the NFL season, for it will consume us whole with drama and tension alike. May the games be spectacles and may our teams not get wrecked by injury and impotence alike. The NFL is king, and we will feast on the droppings that fall to us from its sweet, sweet table.\n\nThis video is dedicated to Week One of the happenings in the league. This is going to be an MCU feature by the end of the year. I can feel it.\n\nYes, this year is going to kill me. Thanks for asking."

            "description": "Minecraft Speedrunner VS TITAN. You asked for it. The return of Minecraft Manhunt, for a season 2. This is the first episode of many.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dream.shop\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt 2: TITAN TAKEDOWN. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, instead of multiple hunters. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. I'm excited to see how this goes over the coming months.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. \n\nThe TITAN theme music is custom scored by Dream & PmBata. Will hopefully be custom sound tracking all the future videos so anyone can feel free to react! (this has two non-custom songs in it, but not during the hunt)\n\nIf this video somehow gets 1,000,000 likes we'll announce the date of the next episode early.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MinecraftManhunt #MinecraftManhunt2",

                "description": "Minecraft Speedrunner VS TITAN. You asked for it. The return of Minecraft Manhunt, for a season 2. This is the first episode of many.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dream.shop\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt 2: TITAN TAKEDOWN. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, instead of multiple hunters. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. I'm excited to see how this goes over the coming months.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. \n\nThe TITAN theme music is custom scored by Dream & PmBata. Will hopefully be custom sound tracking all the future videos so anyone can feel free to react! (this has two non-custom songs in it, but not during the hunt)\n\nIf this video somehow gets 1,000,000 likes we'll announce the date of the next episode early.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MinecraftManhunt #MinecraftManhunt2"

He gives his takeaways after calling Texas’ blowout win over Michigan in the Big House and why he believes the Longhorns are a Tier 1 team in the sport now along with Georgia and Ohio State. He also details why he is very concerned about what he saw from the Wolverines on Saturday. Klatt discusses Nebraska’s win over Coach Prime and Colorado and what the result means for both programs. He praises the Lincoln faithful and Matt Rhule’s team before expressing his concern for Colorado this season. He then looks at the impact of Notre Dame’s upset loss on their Playoff chances and why this loss unraveled everything they gained with the Week 1 win over Texas A&M.

            "description": "Learn to fly 2 is one of the greatest flash games ever. If you were to make a flash game tier list this is easily one of the best. Despite releasing in 2011 and flash player ending learn 2 fly is actually still an actively played game with a brilliant speedrunning community. \n\nOne of my favourite YouTubers EazySpeezy even managed to set a great speedrunning time in the game completing the entire thing on day 9. I however am the Spiffing Brit and whilst others play fair. I want to destroy the Ballance of every game I play. That is why today you will be watching a penguin go faster than the speed of sound. Faster than the speed of light and in fact faster than the game can even comprehend. \n\nI hope you all enjoy the show!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\n\nTitle: Can I Use Exploits To Beat Speedrunners? - Learn To Fly 2 IS PERFECTLY BALANCED\n\n#game #flashgame #speedrun",

Despite releasing in 2011 and flash player ending learn 2 fly is actually still an actively played game with a brilliant speedrunning community. \n\nOne of my favourite YouTubers EazySpeezy even managed to set a great speedrunning time in the game completing the entire thing on day 9. I however am the Spiffing Brit and whilst others play fair. I want to destroy the Ballance of every game I play. That is why today you will be watching a penguin go faster than the speed of sound. Faster than the speed of light and in fact faster than the game can even comprehend. \n\nI hope you all enjoy the show!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts.
