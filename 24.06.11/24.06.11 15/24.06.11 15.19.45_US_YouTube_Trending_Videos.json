                "description": "It’s now been a few days since Starship’s fourth Integrated Flight Test and the company just released some ground footage of the booster’s landing. While short, it gives more details into the exact orientation, engine use, and even proximity to the intended landing site.\n\nThis comes in addition to more comments from Musk talking about the boosters landing burn and why they might try to catch it on the next attempt. Based on the time between launches going back to IFT-1, the 5th flight could be sooner than many think. Here I will go more in-depth into the new booster footage, the launch timeline, catching challenges, and more.\n\nFor more space-related content check out - https://thespacebucket.com/\n\nCredit: \nSpaceX - https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX\n\nBooster Landing Link - https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1799458854067118450\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:31 - New Booster Video\n3:20 - The Next Flight"

Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 22 points and 6 rebounds while Kristaps Porzingis (20 points (8-13 FG), 6 rebounds) and Jayson Tatum (16 points, 11 rebounds, 5 assists) totaled 36 points. Luka Doncic led the Mavericks with 30 points and 10 rebounds while P.J. Washington (14 points, 8 rebounds) and Kyrie Irving (12 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists) totaled 26 points.\n\nIn tonight’s game, the Celtics have 7 players with 2 or more 3PT FGs made. It marks the most players by an individual team with multiple 3PT FGs made in an NBA Finals game. Five teams have had 6 players with multiple 3PT FGs made previously, most recently the Miami Heat last year, on June 4, 2023, v Denver.\n\nKristaps Porzingis scored 18 points in the first half of Game 1 of the NBA Finals after having not played in both the Conf. Semifinals and Conf. Finals. It is the most points by a player in Game 1 of The Finals after having missed the previous two rounds since the league transitioned to a 16-team format in 1984.\n\nPreviously, the most points by a player who fit these qualifiers was 7 points, by Andre Iguodala (GSW v BOS on June 2, 2022).\n\nLuka Doncic is just the 10th player to have a 30-point double-double in their NBA Finals debut. He’s the first to do so since Tim Duncan had 33 points and 16 rebounds in the 1999 NBA Finals on June 16, 1999.\n1.          33/16 reb           Tim Duncan                06/16/1999              SA          NY\n2.          36/12 ast           Michael Jordan     06/02/1991   CHI        LAL\n3.          33/12 reb           Hakeem Olajuwon               05/26/1986   HOU     @BOS\n4.          31/17 reb           Kareem Abdul-Jabbar     04/21/1971        MIL       BAL\n5.          37/16 reb           Willis Reed                 04/24/1970              NYK       LAL\n6.          30/10 reb           Wali Jones                  04/14/1967              PHI        SF\n7.          32/10 reb           Hal Greer                    04/14/1967              PHI        SF\n8.          34/11 reb           Elgin Baylor            04/04/1959   MIN      @BOS\n9.          37/14 reb           Bob Pettit                   03/30/1957              STL        @BOS\n*Jordan did it with AST in 1991, all others did so with REB.",

Five teams have had 6 players with multiple 3PT FGs made previously, most recently the Miami Heat last year, on June 4, 2023, v Denver.\n\nKristaps Porzingis scored 18 points in the first half of Game 1 of the NBA Finals after having not played in both the Conf. Semifinals and Conf. Finals. It is the most points by a player in Game 1 of The Finals after having missed the previous two rounds since the league transitioned to a 16-team format in 1984.\n\nPreviously, the most points by a player who fit these qualifiers was 7 points, by Andre Iguodala (GSW v BOS on June 2, 2022).\n\nLuka Doncic is just the 10th player to have a 30-point double-double in their NBA Finals debut. He’s the first to do so since Tim Duncan had 33 points and 16 rebounds in the 1999 NBA Finals on June 16, 1999.\n1.          33/16 reb           Tim Duncan                06/16/1999              SA          NY\n2.          36/12 ast           Michael Jordan     06/02/1991   CHI        LAL\n3.          33/12 reb           Hakeem Olajuwon               05/26/1986   HOU     @BOS\n4.          31/17 reb           Kareem Abdul-Jabbar     04/21/1971        MIL       BAL\n5.          37/16 reb           Willis Reed                 04/24/1970              NYK       LAL\n6.          30/10 reb           Wali Jones                  04/14/1967              PHI        SF\n7.          32/10 reb           Hal Greer                    04/14/1967              PHI        SF\n8.          34/11 reb           Elgin Baylor            04/04/1959   MIN      @BOS\n9.          37/14 reb           Bob Pettit                   03/30/1957              STL        @BOS\n*Jordan did it with AST in 1991, all others did so with REB."

Previous methods of charcoal making directly heat the wood by burning a portion of it to create the charcoal. But this method applies the heat indirectly to the wood with it completely sealed off from oxygen. The wood successfully turns to charcoal on a small scale but fails to scale up due to the larger pot cracking during the firing and letting air in which burns the wood to ash. The theory is sound but more work needs to be done on the pot to stop it from cracking. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

                "description": "Ray J joins Shannon Sharpe for an engaging episode of Club Shay Shay, sharing an in-depth look into his multifaceted life and career. Ray J opens up about his upbringing, moving from Mississippi to Compton, and the challenges he faced, including his father driving him from Carson to Hollywood auditions and his dislike for choir rehearsals. He reflects on getting into trouble, joining a gang, and the influence of his sister Brandy’s big break with her first album.\n\nHe shares his early realization of Pharrell Williams’ talent and working with various A-list celebrities as a child. He reminisces about being spoiled as a kid, receiving a Cadillac at 14, and his experiences with his cousin, Snoop Dogg. He discusses attending private school after getting jumped at public school and his mother managing both his and Brandy’s careers. Ray J delves into the growing distance between him and Brandy due to his actions, and his encounters with Michael Jackson, facilitated by Brandy.\n\nRay J addresses Vince Staples’ comments about him being a top 5 West Coast rapper, shares his top 5 West Coast artists, and discusses the current state of West Coast rap with artists like YG and Kendrick Lamar. He gives his take on the Kendrick vs. Drake and Chris Brown vs. Quavo beef and his diss song with Chris Brown aimed at Kanye West.\n\nRay J candidly talks about his need for reality shows to assess his personal growth, feeling blackballed in the industry, and the process of Shaq investing $1.5M into his music. He explains why he became an independent artist, what he wishes he knew as a younger artist, and his admiration for Chris Brown’s career.\n\nHe talks about the incredible success of Raycon, earning $80M a year for four years, and his involvement in TV networks, including a show featuring BlueFace and Chrisean Rock on his broadcast network. Ray J opens up about his relationship with 50 Cent and shares his views on why celebrities often date the same people.\n\nRay J candidly discusses his complex personal relationships, including stealing his ex, Princess, from Floyd Mayweather and the ensuing conflict. He talks about his preference for older women and how one helped cleanse him during his teenage years. He also touches on his tumultuous marriage with Princess, expressing his intent to never date again but only \"slay,\" and explains the recurring issues between them.\n\nRay J recounts his initial meeting with Kim Kardashian when she was Brandy's closet designer, their subsequent relationship, and the infamous tape. He acknowledges the tape's profitability but also reflects on the embarrassment it caused, especially now that he has children. He discusses the success of the Kardashians and speculates on how different the world might be if the tape had never surfaced.\n\nHis relationship with Kanye West comes up, highlighting a unique gift from Kanye—a Balenciaga straight jacket. Ray J mentions he no longer has anyone he wants to fight in a celebrity boxing match but is open to the idea of doing OnlyFans. He shares memories of attending parties at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion at just 16 years old.\n\nFinally, Ray J speaks on the legal troubles faced by his friends R. Kelly and Diddy, expressing the personal pain he felt as they went down.

After a one-week stay docked to the International Space Station, the Starliner and crew will land under parachutes in the western United States.\n \nThe launch attempt on May 6 was scrubbed due to a faulty oxygen relief valve observation on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket Centaur second stage. The launch attempt on June 1 was scrubbed due to an observation of a ground launch sequencer. \n\nLaunch coverage on NASA+ (https://plus.nasa.gov) will end shortly after Starliner orbital insertion.
