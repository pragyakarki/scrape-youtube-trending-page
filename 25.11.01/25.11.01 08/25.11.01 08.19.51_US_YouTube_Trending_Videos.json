Had to squawk 7600 and make my way to the runway via light-signal (first time for everything). Turns out the alternator was off and the battery died. The landing was also less-than-pretty and the wheel fairings were a bit too tight, so when we touched down, they sorta exploded. They had to shut down the runway and do a FOD walk to pick up the chunks of fiberglass! There were firetrucks and everything (fortunately, not necessary). Not my favorite test flight, but a good story!\n\nOh yeah, we recorded some new stuff for Billie Bust Up and guys... this game is going to blow your socks off. I really don't think I can overstate it. I can't WAIT for this game to come out!\n\nOK, that's all I have time for. My wife is eepy but also wants to watch a movie, so I gotta go do that before she falls asleep and I have to carry her to bed.

I thought we were done after Daisies, but Nate and I got to talking about the new season and Alastor's backstory and we had this idea... we just had to make a song about it!\nThen Lux came in with her genius visual storytelling, and that was that! I hope y'all like it! It's one of my new faves!\n\nCREDITS:\n\n\nWritten by Gabe & Nate brown (Black Gryph0n & Baasik)\n\nProduced by Nate Brown (Baasik): https://www.youtube.com/user/Baasikmusic\n\nPerformed by Gabriel Brown (Black Gryph0n): https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nAnimated by Luximus: https://youtube.com/@Luximus17?si=xzByJGFs_3R5mcpa (https://youtube.com/@Luximus17?si=xzByJGFs_3R5mcpa)\n\n\n\n-- --- ---- ----- Lyrics ----- ---- --- --\n\n\n“With your smile, turn the world upside down”\n\nSit down, I’m gonna tell ya\nA little story ‘bout a sad little fella\nHe was a Dapper-Dan Cinderella\nOh, and lemme tell ya\nIt made the other fellas jealous\n\nThey made him cry\n“Na na na”\nSpit in his eye\n“Ha ha ha”\nHow could they pick on such a friendly little guy?\n\nThis town was kinda broken\nNot the kind of place you’d leave your doors open\nFull of backwards, back-woods broke-men\nStill he was copin’\nYeah he was dreamin’ hopin’\n\nHe’d get away\n“Na na na”\nMaybe someday\n“Ha ha ha”\nBut on the radio his momma used to play.\n\n“When it feels like all the world is wearing a frown\nPut a smile on and spread it around.”\n\nWith your smile, turn the world upside down.\n\nCHORUS:\nDa da, da da da da\nDa da da da da dada\n\nWell now he had the spirit\nAnd he would smile every time he’d hear it\nSoon he knew every single lyric\nOh, and he would sing it\nAnd in his sleep he’d dream it\n\nAll day and night\n“Na na na”\nThrough every fight\n“La La La”\nYou wouldn’t judge him if you knew what it was like\n\nAnd how, as luck would have it\nHe got rewarded for his weird new habit\nHe earned a fat green stack of cabbage\nAnd he planned to stash it\nTill he was livin’ lavish\n\nThat fateful day\n“Na na na”\nHe ran away\n“La La La”\nAnd he could hear the song his momma used to play\n\n“When it feels like all the world is wearing a frown\nPut a smile on and spread it around…”\n\nWith his smile, he’d turn the world upside down!\n\nChorus:\nDa da, da da da da\nDa da da da da dada\n\nWhen it feels like all the world is wearing a frown\nPut a smile on and spread it around.\n\nWith my smile, I turned the world upside down.\n\n\n- -- --- ---- ----- END ----- ---- --- -- -\n\nHello DDR’s (dedicated description readers)\n\nYou guys, we have been going NON-STOP but it's all GOOD (except for yesterday, that was kinda scary) but everything else is good! Lots of new music, but we can't show you yet because it's all in stuff that we don't own... but hopefully we'll be able to show you soon!\n\nAnyway, yesterday I went to Eugene to test-fly an airplane and had a complete loss of coms. Had to squawk 7600 and make my way to the runway via light-signal (first time for everything). Turns out the alternator was off and the battery died. The landing was also less-than-pretty and the wheel fairings were a bit too tight, so when we touched down, they sorta exploded. They had to shut down the runway and do a FOD walk to pick up the chunks of fiberglass! There were firetrucks and everything (fortunately, not necessary). Not my favorite test flight, but a good story!\n\nOh yeah, we recorded some new stuff for Billie Bust Up and guys... this game is going to blow your socks off. I really don't think I can overstate it. I can't WAIT for this game to come out!\n\nOK, that's all I have time for. My wife is eepy but also wants to watch a movie, so I gotta go do that before she falls asleep and I have to carry her to bed. My back only has a few more of those trips left in it...\n\nLOVE Y'ALL!!\n\n~Gabe"

            "description": "We are celebrating your comments for the official Have You Ever Seen The Rain music video. Thank you for supporting CCR! \n\nWatch the official Have You Ever Seen The Rain music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1V8YRJnr4Q\n\nFollow Creedence Clearwater Revival:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@TheOfficialCCR\nhttps://instagram.com/theofficialccr\nhttps://tiktok.com/@theofficialccr\nhttps://facebook.com/ccr\nhttps://twitter.com/theofficialccr\n\nListen to “CCR: Chronicle - The 20 Greatest Hits”: https://ffm.to/ccr-chronicle\n\nVisit the CCR store:\nhttps://ccr.concord.com/products/\n\nSubscribe to the CCR Newsletter: https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=Ut6Y6V&g=WyE6eZ\n\nAbout Creedence Clearwater Revival: \nCreedence Clearwater Revival’s 1968 self-titled debut album introduced the world to guitar-playing brothers John and Tom Fogerty, drummer Doug Clifford, and bassist Stu Cook, four young men out of El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area. Though they emerged in a place and time where trippy psychedelic visions were the order of the day, CCR bucked the trends and instead tapped into a rich, traditional seam of American music that connected to blues, country, rockabilly, gospel, folk and R&B.    \n\nDuring their short time together as a band (1968 – 1972), the band enjoyed an unparalleled period of creativity lead by singer, songwriter, arranger John Fogerty. They’ve sold close to 100 million records, releasing 14 Top 10 hits. They also managed to play over 150 tour dates around the world, including a headlining spot at Woodstock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival’s canon has become a part of the Great American Songbook. Fogerty penned songs like “Bad Moon Rising,” “Down on the Corner,” “Fortunate Son,” “Have You Ever Seen the Rain,” “Proud Mary,” “Born on the Bayou,” “Travelin’ Band” and “Up Around the Bend” have been ingrained into pop culture — not just as rock staples, but as classic standards.\n\nWith so many memorable songs that continue to grace our radio waves, television and movie screens, plus lyrics that still resonate today, Creedence Clearwater Revival is, truly, America’s greatest rock ’n’ roll band.\n\n#ccr #creedenceclearwaterrevival #haveyoueverseentherain",

Though they emerged in a place and time where trippy psychedelic visions were the order of the day, CCR bucked the trends and instead tapped into a rich, traditional seam of American music that connected to blues, country, rockabilly, gospel, folk and R&B.    \n\nDuring their short time together as a band (1968 – 1972), the band enjoyed an unparalleled period of creativity lead by singer, songwriter, arranger John Fogerty. They’ve sold close to 100 million records, releasing 14 Top 10 hits. They also managed to play over 150 tour dates around the world, including a headlining spot at Woodstock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival’s canon has become a part of the Great American Songbook. Fogerty penned songs like “Bad Moon Rising,” “Down on the Corner,” “Fortunate Son,” “Have You Ever Seen the Rain,” “Proud Mary,” “Born on the Bayou,” “Travelin’ Band” and “Up Around the Bend” have been ingrained into pop culture — not just as rock staples, but as classic standards.\n\nWith so many memorable songs that continue to grace our radio waves, television and movie screens, plus lyrics that still resonate today, Creedence Clearwater Revival is, truly, America’s greatest rock ’n’ roll band.\n\n#ccr #creedenceclearwaterrevival #haveyoueverseentherain"

Paradox on steam describe the game as so: Use war, trade or diplomacy to satisfy your grandest ambitions and dominate five centuries of history in the newest version of Europa Universalis, Paradox Interactive's flagship historical grand strategy game.\n\nI think its a pretty darn accurate representation of the game as trade war and diplomacy make up the foundational pillars of this strategy game. However today I am not intending to play the game in a way that was intended. I am not playing as England and winning the 100 years war against France, NO! I am playing as the hanseatic league. The Single most overpowered nation in all of EU5. Today I will show you how to make big money, make a big empire and how to become the worlds leading economic great power! \n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Intro\n02:20 - Chapter 1: The Basics\n05:44 - Setting up our Trade Routes\n09:14 - Our new Best Friend\n12:23 - Bullying the Tuscans\n18:44 - To War!\n20:27 - Chapter 2: The Black Death\n22:55 - When you beat them, Join them!\n28:07 - The Trade Snowball\n31:01 - Chapter 3: The Climb\n33:32 - The Road to Number 1!\n36:26 - All Hail the Hanseatic League!\n38:47 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitles:\nEuropa Universalis 5 - The WORLDS Most Complicated Strategy Game Is Here, I BROKE IT.\nEuropa Universalis 5 Is A Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits\nThe Spiffing Brit Vs EU5 - 2025s Hardest Strategy Game Is Perfectly Balanced\n\n#eu5 #funny #gameplay"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Trap Capos, Noriel, Bryant Myers, Juhn\n\nYa no sé qué hacer\nNo sé con cuál quedarme\nTodas saben en la cama maltratarme\nMe tienen bien. De sexo, me tienen bien\n\nEstoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero\nChingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero\nDos son casadas, hay una soltera\nLa otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera\nEstoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero\nChingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero\nDos son casadas, hay una soltera\nLa otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera\n\nLa primera se desespera\nSe encojona si se lo echo afuera\nLa segunda tiene la funda\nY me paga pa' que se lo hunda\nLa tercera me quita el estrés\nPolvo corridos siempre echamos tres\nA la cuarta de una, le bajo la luna\nPero ella quiere con Maluma y conmigo a la vez\nEstoy enamorado de las cuatro\nSiempre las busco después de las cuatro\nA las cuatro les encanta en cuatro\nY yo nunca fallo como el 24\nDe los Lakers siempre es la gorra\nDe chingar ninguna se enzorra\nEstoy metio' en un lío, y hasta confundio'\nPorque ninguna de mi mente se borra\n\nMe pongo las gafas Cartier, saliendo del aeropuerto\nVestio' Giuseppe , zapatos en piel\nTú tienes todas mis cuentas de banco y el número de la MasterCard\nTú eres mi mujer oficial, me tiene enamorado ese culote con ese pelo rubio\nPero tengo otra pelinegra que siempre quiere chichar\nA veces hasta le llega al estudio\nLa pelirroja chichando es la más que se moja\nLa encojona que me llame y no lo coja\nPeleamos y me bota la ropa y tengo que llamar a cotorra pa' que la recoja\nTengo una chiquitita nalgona con el pelo corto\nMe dice papi vente adentro, si me preña\nBryant Myers\n\nEstoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero\nChingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero\nDos son casadas, hay una soltera\nLa otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera\nEstoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero\nChingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero\nDos son casadas, hay una soltera\nLa otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera\n\nY estoy metío en un lío\nA todas yo quiero darle\nMe tienen bien confundío\nYa no sé ni con cuál quedarme\nY es que todas maman bien\nTodas me los hacen bien\nTodas quieren chingarme encima de billetes de cien\nMe tienen en un patín\nComprando en San Valentín\nYa me salieron más caras que un reloj de Ulysse Nardin\nEs que las babys están dura y ninguna de la' cuatro se ha hecho completa\nDos tienen maridos y ninguna de las dos al marido respetan\n\nCuatro chimbitas, cuatro personalidades\nDos me hablan bonito, dos dicen maldades\nDiferentes nacionalidades\nPero cuando chingan gritan todas por iguales\nQuiere que la lleve pal Medallo\nQuiere que la monte en carro del año\nQue a una la coja, a la otra la apriete\nY a las otras dos les dé juntas en el baño\nDigan qué más quieren hacer\nEl Dirty las va a entretener\nEn la casa gigante, hay un party en el yate que él quiere tener\nNo sé si me entiendes, bebé\n\nEstoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero\nChingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero\nDos son casadas, hay una soltera\nLa otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera\nEstoy enamorado de 4 babys, siempre me dan lo que quiero\nChingan cuando yo les digo, ninguna me pone pero\nDos son casadas, hay una soltera\nLa otra medio psycho y si no la llamo se desespera\n\n🔖Tags\nmaluma,cuatro babys,trap capos,noriel,bryant myers,juhn,maluma cuatro babys lyrics,cuatro babys maluma lyrics,maluma cuatro babys letra,cuatro babys maluma letra,maluma lyrics cuatro babys,maluma letra cuatro babys,lyrics maluma,lyrics cuatro babys,letra maluma,letra cuatro babys,latin,latin music,latin trending latin,trend latin,hiphop,hiphop rap,hiphop song,rap,rap song,tiktok,tiktok song,trending song,trend song,lyrics on screen,\n\n#Maluma #CuatroBabys"

            "description": "We are BACK at the Casino, and this video's ABOUT TO GET SPOOKY! 6 Halloween Costumes matching 6 DIFFERENT Slot Machines, what could possibly go wrong? Surely we scare the grand jackpot out of all the machines right? Thank you all for watching! You’re all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nPlay your favorite slots and table games completely for free at: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nBrettski’s Halloween Special was supposed to be lighthearted—a fun, family-friendly casino marathon where he’d wear six different costumes, each matching the slot machine’s theme. He arrived with his camera crew, bags of costumes, and a huge grin. “Tonight,” he announced, “we spin spooky—but make it wholesome.”\n\nFirst up, the vampire costume at Immortal Romance.

Di sicuro spaventiamo il jackpot di tutte le slot machine, vero? Grazie a tutti per aver guardato! Siete tutti bellissimi e apprezzo davvero ognuno di voi per averci accompagnato in questo folle viaggio. Auguratemi buona fortuna e ci vediamo alla prossima! Andiamo in guerra!\n\nGioca alle tue slot e ai tuoi giochi da tavolo preferiti completamente gratis su: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nLo speciale di Halloween di Brettski doveva essere spensierato: una divertente maratona di casinò per famiglie in cui avrebbe indossato sei costumi diversi, ognuno abbinato al tema della slot machine. È arrivato con la sua troupe, borse di costumi e un enorme sorriso. \"Stasera\", ha annunciato, \"giocheremo in modo spettrale, ma sano\".\n\nPrima di tutto, il costume da vampiro da Immortal Romance. Le luci si abbassarono perfettamente per l'atmosfera e, al secondo giro, vinse un grosso bonus. \"Magia di Halloween!\" rise. Ma mentre riscuoteva le sue vincite, la macchina lampeggiò \"Bentornato, Brett\", il che era strano. Non ci aveva mai giocato prima.\n\nPoi fu il turno del costume da esploratore per Temple of Treasures. Finse di \"scoprire\" la slot come se fosse un manufatto nascosto. Ma al primo giro, i rulli si fermarono su tutti gli idoli d'oro: un jackpot impossibile. L'addetto corse da lui, confuso. \"Signore... questo gioco non è stato attivo per tutto il giorno\".\n\nSe ne sbarazzò, indossando un costume da pirata per Ocean Riches. La macchina si scatenò con giri bonus, finché lo schermo non si bloccò e apparve la scritta \"Trova il tesoro prima che scada il tempo\". Il timer iniziò a scorrere, poi si azzerò da solo.\n\nAl quinto costume, un lupo mannaro per Full Moon Fortune, le cose divennero semplicemente strane. Il suo riflesso sul vetro della slot non corrispondeva esattamente ai suoi movimenti. Lo staff scherzò dicendo che era l'illuminazione del casinò.\n\nFinalmente, vestito da zucca, Brettski si sedette ad Harvest Wins, la sua ultima slot della serata. Inserì il suo ultimo biglietto – 5.000 dollari rimanenti – e premette il tasto \"registra\". \"Un ultimo giro per la finale di Halloween\", disse.\n\nI rulli girarono: zucche, caramelle e stelle. Le luci del jackpot lampeggiarono e tutte le slot della fila si attivarono improvvisamente in sincronia, suonando all'unisono.\n\nPoi, la sua slot si illuminò di arancione brillante con un messaggio sullo schermo:\n\"Bonus Round: Continua...\"\n\n#slot #blackjack #gioco d'azzardo #casinò #baccarat #roulette\n\nChi è Brettski? Brettski è un giocatore professionista, simile alle antiche leggende Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot o Lady Luck HQ! Tuttavia, a differenza di queste leggende, Brettski ha migliaia di anni di conoscenze antiche, accumulate dagli anziani, in abilità come slot machine, roulette, blackjack, dadi, bubble craps, poker e baccarat.

Er kam mit seinem Kamerateam, Taschen voller Kostüme und einem breiten Grinsen. „Heute Abend“, verkündete er, „drehen wir gruselig – aber nicht zu streng.“\n\nAls Erstes: das Vampirkostüm bei Immortal Romance. Das Licht wurde passend zur Stimmung gedimmt, und bei seinem zweiten Dreh kassierte er einen satten Bonus. „Halloween-Magie!“, lachte er. Doch als er seinen Gewinn einsammelte, blinkte auf dem Automaten „Willkommen zurück, Brett“ – seltsam. Er hatte noch nie gespielt.\n\nAls Nächstes kam das Entdeckerkostüm für „Tempel der Schätze“. Er tat so, als würde er den Spielautomaten „entdecken“, als wäre er ein verstecktes Artefakt. Doch bei seinem ersten Dreh blieben die Walzen auf lauter goldenen Idolen stehen – ein unmöglicher Jackpot. Der Angestellte rannte verwirrt herbei. „Sir … dieses Spiel war den ganzen Tag nicht aktiv.“\n\nEr tat es ab und zog sich ein Piratenkostüm für „Ocean Riches“ an. Der Automat spielte wild mit Bonusrunden – bis der Bildschirm einfror und die Worte „Finde den Schatz, bevor die Zeit abläuft“ erschienen. Der Timer lief herunter und setzte sich dann von selbst zurück.\n\nBeim fünften Kostüm – einem Werwolf für „Full Moon Fortune“ – war alles einfach nur seltsam. Sein Spiegelbild im Glas des Spielautomaten passte nicht ganz zu seinen Bewegungen. Die Crew scherzte, es läge an der Casinobeleuchtung.\n\nSchließlich setzte sich Brettski in seinem Kürbiskostüm an Harvest Wins, seinen letzten Spielautomaten des Abends. Er warf seinen letzten Tippschein ein – noch 5.000 Dollar übrig – und drückte auf Aufnahme. „Noch eine letzte Runde für das Halloween-Finale“, sagte er.\n\nDie Walzen drehten sich: Kürbisse, Süßigkeiten und Sterne. Jackpot-Lichter blinkten, und alle Automaten in der Reihe gingen plötzlich synchron an und läuteten im Gleichtakt.\n\nDann leuchtete sein Automat leuchtend orange auf, und auf dem Bildschirm stand eine Meldung:\n„Bonusrunde: Fortsetzung folgt…“\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski?

Он пришёл со своей съёмочной группой, сумками костюмов и широкой улыбкой. «Сегодня вечером, – объявил он, – мы будем крутить жутковато, но с пользой для здоровья».\n\nСначала костюм вампира в Immortal Romance. Свет идеально приглушил настроение, и на втором вращении ему выпал крупный бонус. «Магия Хэллоуина!» — рассмеялся он. Но когда он забирал выигрыш, на автомате высветилось: «С возвращением, Бретт» — что было странно. Он никогда раньше в него не играл.\n\nЗатем был костюм исследователя для Temple of Treasures. Он притворился, что «открыл» слот, словно это был спрятанный артефакт. Но при первом вращении барабаны остановились на всех золотых идолах — невероятный джекпот. Подбежал растерянный продавец. «Сэр… эта игра не была активна весь день».\n\nОн пожал плечами и переоделся в пиратский костюм для Ocean Riches. Автомат буквально взорвался бонусными раундами, пока экран не замер и не появилась надпись «Найдите сокровище, пока не истечёт время». Таймер отсчитал время и сам обнулился.\n\nК пятому костюму — оборотня для Full Moon Fortune — всё стало просто странно. Его отражение в стекле автомата не совсем соответствовало его движениям. Команда шутила, что это из-за освещения казино.\n\nНаконец, в костюме тыквы, Бреттски сел за столик в Harvest Wins, его последнем игровом автомате на этот вечер. Он бросил свой последний билет — осталось 5000 долларов — и нажал кнопку записи. «Последний спин в финале Хэллоуина», — сказал он.\n\nБарабаны закрутились: тыквы, конфеты и звёзды. Замигали огни джекпота, и все автоматы в ряду внезапно синхронно заработали, звеня одновременно.\n\nЗатем его автомат загорелся ярко-оранжевым светом, и на экране появилось одно сообщение:\n«Бонусный раунд: Продолжение следует…»\n\n#слоты #блэкджек #азартные игры #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nКто такой Бреттски? Бреттски — профессиональный игрок, похожий на легендарных Вегас Мэтта, Блаффа, ДегенДальта, TheBigJackpot или Госпожу Удачу! Однако, в отличие от этих легенд, Бреттски обладает тысячелетними знаниями, накопленными старейшинами, и владеет такими навыками, как игра в игровые автоматы, рулетка, блэкджек, крэпс, бабл-крэпс, покер и баккара. Цель Бреттски как профессионального игрока проста: завладеть всем Лас-Вегасом, используя средства, заработанные азартными играми. Подпишитесь, чтобы поддержать его стремление к мировому господству."

Ele chegou com sua equipe de filmagem, sacolas de fantasias e um sorriso enorme. \"Hoje à noite\", anunciou ele, \"vamos girar de forma assustadora — mas que seja saudável.\"\n\nPrimeiro, a fantasia de vampiro no Immortal Romance. As luzes diminuíram perfeitamente para o clima, e na segunda rodada, ele conseguiu um bônus enorme. \"Magia de Halloween!\", ele riu. Mas, enquanto coletava seus ganhos, a máquina piscou \"Bem-vindo de volta, Brett\" — o que era estranho. Ele nunca tinha jogado antes.\n\nA seguir, veio a fantasia de explorador para o Temple of Treasures. Ele fingiu \"descobrir\" o caça-níquel como se fosse um artefato escondido. Mas na primeira rodada, os rolos pararam em todos os ídolos dourados — um prêmio impossível. O atendente correu até ele, confuso. \"Senhor... este jogo não esteve ativo o dia todo.\"\n\nEle deu de ombros, trocando para uma roupa de pirata para o Ocean Riches. A máquina enlouqueceu com rodadas bônus — até que a tela congelou e as palavras \"Encontre o tesouro antes que o tempo acabe\" apareceram. O cronômetro começou a contar e depois zerar sozinho.\n\nNa quinta fantasia — um lobisomem para o Full Moon Fortune — as coisas estavam simplesmente estranhas. Seu reflexo no vidro do caça-níquel não correspondia exatamente aos seus movimentos. A equipe brincou que era a iluminação do cassino.\n\nFinalmente, em seu traje de abóbora, Brettski sentou-se no Harvest Wins, seu último slot da noite. Ele inseriu seu último bilhete — US$ 5.000 restantes — e apertou o botão de gravar. \"Uma última rodada para o final de Halloween\", disse ele.\n\nOs rolos giraram: abóboras, doces e estrelas. As luzes do jackpot piscaram e todas as máquinas na fileira de repente dispararam em sincronia, tocando juntas.\n\nEntão, sua máquina acendeu em laranja brilhante com uma mensagem na tela:\n\"Rodada de Bônus: Continua...\"\n\n#caça-níqueis #blackjack #jogos de azar #cassino #bacará #roleta\n\nQuem é Brettski?

Las luces se atenuaron a la perfección para crear el ambiente, y en su segundo giro, consiguió una gran bonificación. \"¡Magia de Halloween!\", rió. Pero mientras cobraba sus ganancias, la máquina mostró \"Bienvenido de nuevo, Brett\", lo cual era extraño. Nunca había jugado.\n\nA continuación, le tocó el disfraz de explorador para Temple of Treasures. Fingió \"descubrir\" la tragamonedas como si fuera un artefacto oculto.

Su reflejo en el cristal de la tragamonedas no coincidía del todo con sus movimientos.

He arrived with his camera crew, bags of costumes, and a huge grin. “Tonight,” he announced, “we spin spooky—but make it wholesome.”\n\nFirst up, the vampire costume at Immortal Romance. The lights dimmed perfectly for the mood, and on his second spin, he landed a big bonus. “Halloween magic!” he laughed. But as he collected his winnings, the machine flashed “Welcome back, Brett”—which was odd. He’d never played it before.\n\nNext was the explorer costume for Temple of Treasures. He pretended to “discover” the slot like it was a hidden artifact. But on his first spin, the reels stopped on all golden idols—an impossible jackpot. The attendant ran over, confused. “Sir… this game hasn’t been active all day.”\n\nHe shrugged it off, changing into a pirate outfit for Ocean Riches. The machine went wild with bonus rounds—until the screen froze and the words “Find the treasure before time runs out” appeared. The timer ticked down, then reset on its own.\n\nBy the fifth costume—a werewolf for Full Moon Fortune—things were just plain weird. His reflection in the slot’s glass didn’t quite match his movements. The crew joked it was the casino lighting.\n\nFinally, in his pumpkin suit, Brettski sat down at Harvest Wins, his last slot of the night. He put in his final ticket—$5,000 left—and pressed record. “One last spin for the Halloween finale,” he said.\n\nThe reels spun: pumpkins, candy, and stars. Jackpot lights flashed, and every machine in the row suddenly went off in sync, chiming together.\n\nThen, his machine lit up bright orange with one message on screen:\n“Bonus Round: To Be Continued…”\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski?

Przecież zgarniemy główną wygraną ze wszystkich automatów, prawda? Dziękuję wszystkim za oglądanie! Jesteście wspaniali i naprawdę doceniam każdego z Was za udział w tej szalonej podróży. Życzcie mi powodzenia i do zobaczenia w następnym odcinku! Do boju!\n\nGrajcie w swoje ulubione automaty i gry stołowe całkowicie za darmo na: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nHalloweenowy odcinek specjalny Brettskiego miał być beztroski – zabawny, rodzinny maraton kasynowy, w którym miał założyć sześć różnych kostiumów, każdy pasujący do motywu automatu. Przybył ze swoją ekipą filmową, torbami pełnymi kostiumów i szerokim uśmiechem. „Dziś wieczorem” – oznajmił – „kręcimy strasznie, ale zdrowo”.\n\nNa początek kostium wampira w Immortal Romance. Światła przygasły idealnie, by oddać nastrój, a przy drugim obrocie trafił mu się spory bonus. „Halloweenowa magia!” – zaśmiał się. Ale gdy odbierał wygraną, na wyświetlaczu pojawił się napis „Witaj ponownie, Brett” – co było dziwne. Nigdy wcześniej w to nie grał.\n\nNastępny był kostium odkrywcy do Temple of Treasures. Udawał, że „odkrywa” automat, jakby był ukrytym artefaktem. Ale przy pierwszym obrocie bębny zatrzymały się na wszystkich złotych idolach – niemożliwa do zdobycia kumulacja. Pracownik podbiegł, zdezorientowany. „Proszę pana… ta gra nie była aktywna przez cały dzień”.\n\nZignorował to i przebrał się w strój pirata do Ocean Riches. Automat szalał z rundami bonusowymi – aż ekran się zamroził i pojawił się napis „Znajdź skarb, zanim skończy się czas”. Timer zaczął odliczać, a potem sam się zresetował.\n\nPrzy piątym kostiumie – wilkołaka do Full Moon Fortune – wszystko stało się po prostu dziwne. Jego odbicie w szybie automatu nie do końca pasowało do jego ruchów. Ekipa żartowała, że ​​to oświetlenie kasyna.\n\nW końcu, ubrany w kostium dyni, Brettski usiadł przy Harvest Wins, swoim ostatnim automacie tego wieczoru. Wrzucił swój ostatni los – zostało 5000 dolarów – i nacisnął przycisk nagrywania. „Jeszcze jeden obrót przed halloweenowym finałem” – powiedział.\n\nBębny się kręciły: dynie, cukierki i gwiazdki. Światła jackpota błysnęły, a wszystkie maszyny w rzędzie nagle zsynchronizowały się, wydając wspólny dźwięk.\n\nWtedy jego maszyna rozświetliła się na jaskrawo pomarańczowo, wyświetlając na ekranie komunikat:\n„Runda bonusowa: Ciąg dalszy nastąpi…”\n\n#automaty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski? Brettski to profesjonalny hazardzista, podobny do takich legend jak Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot czy Lady Luck HQ! Jednak w przeciwieństwie do tych legend, Brettski posiada tysiące lat starożytnej wiedzy zgromadzonej przez starszyznę, obejmującej takie umiejętności jak automaty do gry, ruletka, blackjack, kości, bubble craps, poker i bakarat. Cel Brettskiego jako profesjonalnego hazardzisty jest prosty: zdobyć całe Las Vegas, wykorzystując środki z hazardu. Subskrybuj, aby wesprzeć jego podróż ku dominacji nad światem."

Він прибув зі своєю знімальною групою, сумками костюмів і широкою посмішкою. «Сьогодні ввечері», — оголосив він, — «ми крутимо моторошно, але зробимо це корисним».\n\nСпочатку костюм вампіра в Immortal Romance. Світло ідеально приглушилося для настрою, і на другому обертанні він отримав великий бонус. «Магія Хелловіну!» — засміявся він. Але коли він забрав свій виграш, автомат висвітлив напис «Ласкаво просимо назад, Бретт» — що було дивно. Він ніколи раніше в нього не грав.\n\nДалі був костюм дослідника для Temple of Treasures. Він вдав, що «відкриває» слот, ніби це був прихований артефакт. Але на першому обертанні барабани зупинилися на всіх золотих ідолах — неможливий джекпот. Збентежений працівник підбіг. «Сер… ця гра не була активною цілий день».\n\nВін знизав плечима, переодягнувшись у піратський костюм для Ocean Riches. Автомат шалено запускав бонусні раунди — доки екран не завмер і не з'явилися слова «Знайди скарб, поки не закінчиться час». Таймер відлік часу спливав, а потім сам скидався.\n\nДо п'ятого костюма — перевертня для Full Moon Fortune — все стало просто дивно. Його відображення у склі слота не зовсім відповідало його рухам. Команда жартувала, що це освітлення казино.\n\nЗрештою, у своєму гарбузовому костюмі, Бреттскі сів за Harvest Wins, свій останній слот вечора. Він вставив свій останній квиток — залишилося 5000 доларів — і натиснув кнопку запису. «Останнє обертання для фіналу Хелловіну», — сказав він.\n\nБарабани закрутилися: гарбузи, цукерки та зірки. Вогні джекпоту спалахнули, і всі машини в ряду раптово синхронно задзвеніли.\n\nПотім його машина засвітилася яскраво-помаранчевим кольором, а на екрані з'явилося одне повідомлення:\n«Бонусний раунд: Продовження буде…»\n\n#слоти #блекджек #азартні ігри #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nХто такий Бреттскі?

Ia datang bersama kru kameranya, tas-tas berisi kostum, dan senyum lebar. \"Malam ini,\" ia mengumumkan, \"kita akan berputar seram—tapi tetap sehat.\"\n\nPertama, kostum vampir di Immortal Romance. Lampu redup sempurna untuk suasana hati, dan pada putaran kedua, ia mendapatkan bonus besar. \"Sihir Halloween!\" tawanya. Namun saat ia mengumpulkan kemenangannya, mesin berkedip \"Selamat datang kembali, Brett\"—anehnya. Ia belum pernah memainkannya sebelumnya.\n\nBerikutnya adalah kostum penjelajah untuk Temple of Treasures. Ia berpura-pura \"menemukan\" slot itu seolah-olah itu adalah artefak tersembunyi. Namun pada putaran pertamanya, gulungan berhenti di semua patung emas—sebuah jackpot yang mustahil. Petugas berlari menghampiri, bingung. \"Pak... permainan ini tidak aktif seharian.\"\n\nIa mengabaikannya, berganti menjadi kostum bajak laut untuk Ocean Riches. Mesin itu menggila dengan putaran bonus—hingga layar membeku dan tulisan \"Temukan harta karun sebelum waktu habis\" muncul. Penghitung waktu berdetak mundur, lalu me-reset sendiri.\n\nPada kostum kelima—manusia serigala untuk Full Moon Fortune—semuanya terasa aneh. Bayangannya di kaca slot tidak sepenuhnya sesuai dengan gerakannya. Para kru bercanda bahwa itu karena pencahayaan kasino.\n\nAkhirnya, dengan kostum labunya, Brettski duduk di Harvest Wins, slot terakhirnya malam itu. Ia memasukkan tiket terakhirnya—sisa $5.000—dan menekan tombol rekam. \"Satu putaran terakhir untuk final Halloween,\" katanya.\n\nGulungan berputar: labu, permen, dan bintang.

Hij arriveerde met zijn cameraploeg, tassen vol kostuums en een brede grijns. \"Vanavond,\" kondigde hij aan, \"maken we een griezelige draai, maar dan wel met een gezonde twist.\"\n\nAllereerst, het vampierenkostuum bij Immortal Romance. De lichten dimden perfect voor de stemming, en bij zijn tweede draai won hij een flinke bonus. \"Halloweenmagie!\" lachte hij. Maar terwijl hij zijn winst ophaalde, flitste de machine \"Welkom terug, Brett\" – wat vreemd was. Hij had het nog nooit eerder gespeeld.\n\nDaarna was het ontdekkingsreizigerskostuum voor Temple of Treasures aan de beurt. Hij deed alsof hij de gokkast \"ontdekte\" alsof het een verborgen artefact was. Maar bij zijn eerste draai stopten de rollen op allemaal gouden idooltjes – een onmogelijke jackpot. De bediende rende verward naar hem toe. \"Meneer... dit spel is de hele dag niet actief geweest.\"\n\nHij haalde zijn schouders op en trok een piratenpak aan voor Ocean Riches. De machine ging tekeer met bonusrondes – totdat het scherm bevroor en de woorden \"Vind de schat voordat de tijd om is\" verschenen. De timer tikte af en resette vervolgens vanzelf.\n\nBij het vijfde kostuum – een weerwolf voor Full Moon Fortune – was het gewoonweg vreemd. Zijn weerspiegeling in het glas van de gokkast kwam niet helemaal overeen met zijn bewegingen. De crew grapte dat het de casinoverlichting was.\n\nEindelijk, in zijn pompoenpak, ging Brettski zitten bij Harvest Wins, zijn laatste gokkast van de avond. Hij gooide zijn laatste lot in de machine – nog $5.000 over – en drukte op de recordknop. \"Nog één laatste draai voor de Halloweenfinale,\" zei hij.\n\nDe rollen draaiden: pompoenen, snoep en sterren. Jackpotlampjes flitsten en alle machines in de rij gingen plotseling synchroon af en lieten tegelijk een geluid horen.\n\nToen lichtte zijn machine feloranje op met één bericht op het scherm:\n\"Bonusronde: Wordt vervolgd...\"\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski?

            "description": "DOUGH RE ME TEE AVAILABLE NOW! https://stupendiumstore.com/product/dough-re-tee/\n\nDeep beneath the colourful facade of the Playtime Co. Factory is a safe haven for the forgotten toys who still cling to their sanity. And watching over them is the lovable, if unstable Doey the Doughman…\n\nAs soon as I learned about Doey I knew I had to do something with him. In fact, I’d written the chorus to this song in my head within about 30 minutes of his reveal! Three characters squeezed into one mind and forced to work together, fighting for a sense of identity that was robbed from them, was such fertile ground for interesting writing.\n\nWhy did I decide to do this live action with a horrifying costume? Why did I not simply hire an animator and instead spend 5 hours having dough glued to my face two days in a row? Why did we construct 12 or so metres of giant tunnels in the studio instead of opting for motion graphics? Why do I do this to myself and more pertinently, to your eyes?\n\nSometimes you have an idea and you just gotta roll with it, frankly. I can only apologise. I am a being fuelled by crazed whimsy and I wanted to be dough.\n\nA huge thanks to our makeup artist Jayne for making that happen!\n\n-----\nCheck out the full Stupendium originals playlist for all of my original songs!\nSTUPENDIUM ORIGINALS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA\nTHE STUPENDIUM ON SPOTIFY:\nhttp://bit.ly/Stupendify\nTHE STUPENDIUM ON iTunes:\nhttp://bit.ly/StupendiTunes\n-----\nVideo by Paul Marke & The Stupendium\nDirected and Edited by Paul Marke\nAdditional Editing by The Stupendium\nShoot coordinator: Lizzy CJ\nGaffer: @whenismatt \nSet fabrication by Nick J.

Why did we construct 12 or so metres of giant tunnels in the studio instead of opting for motion graphics?

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",
