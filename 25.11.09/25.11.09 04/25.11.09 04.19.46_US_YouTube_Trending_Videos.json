Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda’s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba’s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars® for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.",

Chu e interpretato dallo spettacolare cast di ritorno, guidato dalle superstar candidate all'Oscar® Cynthia Erivo e Ariana Grande, il capitolo finale della storia inedita delle streghe di Oz inizia con Elphaba e Glinda separate e costrette a convivere con le conseguenze delle loro scelte.\n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), ora demonizzata come la Strega Cattiva dell'Ovest, vive in esilio, nascosta nella foresta di Oz, mentre continua la sua lotta per la libertà degli Animali di Oz ridotti al silenzio e cerca disperatamente di svelare la verità che conosce sul Mago (Jeff Goldblum).\n\nGlinda, nel frattempo, è diventata il simbolo glamour della Bontà per tutta Oz, vivendo nel palazzo di Emerald City e godendosi i vantaggi della fama e della popolarità. Sotto la guida di Madame Morrible (la vincitrice dell'Oscar® Michelle Yeoh), Glinda viene inviata a fungere da effervescente conforto a Oz, rassicurando le masse che tutto va bene sotto il dominio del Mago.\n\nMentre la celebrità di Glinda si espande e si prepara a sposare il Principe Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey, vincitore del premio Olivier e candidato agli Emmy e ai SAG) in uno spettacolare matrimonio di Oz, è tormentata dalla sua separazione da Elphaba. Tenta di mediare una conciliazione tra Elphaba e il Mago, ma i suoi sforzi falliranno, allontanando ulteriormente Elphaba e Glinda. Le scosse di assestamento trasformeranno per sempre Boq (Ethan Slater, candidato ai Tony) e Fiyero, e minacceranno la sicurezza della sorella di Elphaba, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), quando una ragazza del Kansas irromperà nelle loro vite.\n\nMentre una folla inferocita si ribella alla Strega Cattiva, Glinda ed Elphaba dovranno unirsi un'ultima volta. Con la loro singolare amicizia ora al centro del loro futuro, dovranno vedersi davvero, con onestà ed empatia, se vogliono cambiare se stessi e tutto Oz, per sempre.\n\nWicked: For Good vede anche la partecipazione dei candidati agli Emmy Bowen Yang e Bronwyn James nei panni degli adulatori assistenti di Glinda, Pfannee e ShenShen, e della candidata ai BAFTA e ai Grammy Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, o Change) nel ruolo della tata d'infanzia di Elphaba, Dulcibear.\n\nIl film è prodotto dal pluripremiato Marc Platt p.g.a., vincitore di un Tony Award e di un Emmy Award, e dal pluripremiato David Stone. I produttori esecutivi sono Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman e Dana Fox. Il primo film, Wicked, uscito nel novembre 2024, ha ottenuto 10 nomination agli Oscar®, tra cui Miglior Film, e ha vinto gli Oscar® per i Costumi e la Scenografia. Ad oggi, il film ha incassato 750 milioni di dollari in tutto il mondo.\n\nWicked: For Good è basato sull'omonimo musical teatrale che ha segnato una generazione, con musiche e testi del leggendario compositore e paroliere vincitore di un Grammy e di un Oscar®, Stephen Schwartz, e sul libretto di Winnie Holzman, tratto dal romanzo bestseller di Gregory Maguire. La sceneggiatura è di Winnie Holzman e Winnie Holzman e Dana Fox. La colonna sonora è di John Powell e Stephen Schwartz, con musiche e testi di Stephen Schwartz."

Chu e estrelado pelo elenco espetacular que retorna, liderado pelas superestrelas indicadas ao Oscar® Cynthia Erivo e Ariana Grande, o capítulo final da história não contada das bruxas de Oz começa com Elphaba e Glinda afastadas e vivendo com as consequências de suas escolhas.\n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), agora demonizada como a Bruxa Má do Oeste, vive exilada, escondida na floresta de Oz, enquanto continua sua luta pela liberdade dos animais silenciados de Oz e tenta desesperadamente expor a verdade que sabe sobre o Mágico (Jeff Goldblum).\n\nGlinda, por sua vez, tornou-se o símbolo glamoroso da Bondade para todo o Oz, vivendo no palácio da Cidade Esmeralda e desfrutando dos privilégios da fama e da popularidade. Sob as ordens de Madame Morrible (vencedora do Oscar® Michelle Yeoh), Glinda é enviada para servir como um consolo efervescente para Oz, tranquilizando as massas de que tudo está bem sob o reinado do Mágico.\n\nÀ medida que o estrelato de Glinda cresce e ela se prepara para se casar com o Príncipe Fiyero (vencedor do Prêmio Olivier e indicado ao Emmy e ao SAG, Jonathan Bailey) em um casamento espetacular em Oz, ela é assombrada pela separação de Elphaba. Ela tenta mediar uma reconciliação entre Elphaba e o Mágico, mas seus esforços falham, afastando ainda mais Elphaba e Glinda. As consequências transformarão Boq (indicado ao Tony, Ethan Slater) e Fiyero para sempre, e ameaçarão a segurança da irmã de Elphaba, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), quando uma garota do Kansas invade suas vidas.\n\nEnquanto uma multidão enfurecida se levanta contra a Bruxa Má, Glinda e Elphaba precisarão se unir pela última vez. Com a amizade singular que as une agora sendo o ponto crucial de seus futuros, elas precisarão se enxergar de verdade, com honestidade e empatia, se quiserem mudar a si mesmas e a toda Oz para sempre.\n\nWicked: For Good também conta com o indicado ao Emmy, Bowen Yang, e Bronwyn James como os assistentes bajuladores de Glinda, Pfannee e ShenShen, e a indicada ao BAFTA e ao Grammy, Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change), como a voz da babá de infância de Elphaba, Dulcibear.\n\nO filme é produzido pelo renomado produtor Marc Platt, vencedor do Tony e do Emmy, e pelo também vencedor de múltiplos prêmios Tony, David Stone. Os produtores executivos são Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman e Dana Fox. O primeiro filme, Wicked, lançado em novembro de 2024, recebeu 10 indicações ao Oscar®, incluindo Melhor Filme, e ganhou os Oscars® de Melhor Figurino e Melhor Direção de Arte. Até o momento, o filme arrecadou US$ 750 milhões em todo o mundo.\n\nWicked: For Good é baseado na peça musical que definiu uma geração, com música e letras do lendário compositor e letrista vencedor do Grammy e do Oscar®, Stephen Schwartz, e libreto de Winnie Holzman, a partir do romance best-seller de Gregory Maguire. O roteiro é de Winnie Holzman e Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. A trilha sonora é de John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, com música e letras de Stephen Schwartz."

Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda’s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba’s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars® for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz."

I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nLet him know that you know best\n'Cause after all, you do know best\nYou try to slip past his defense\nWithout granting innocence\nLay down a list of what is wrong\nThe things you've told him all along\nPray to God he hears you\nAnd pray to God he hears you\nAnd where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nAs he begins to raise his voice\nYou lower yours and grant him one last choice\nDrive until you lose the road\nOr break with the ones you've followed\nHe will do one of two things\nHe will admit to everything\nOr he'll say he's just not the same\nAnd you'll begin to wonder why you came\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend (where did I go wrong?)\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night (and I would have stayed up)\nHad I known how to save a life\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\n\nContact: deadradioclubmusic@gmail.com\n_________________________________________________\nThe Fray - How To Save A Life\nReleased 07/07/2006\n\n\n#TheFray\n#pop\n#rock",

I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nAs he begins to raise his voice\nYou lower yours and grant him one last choice\nDrive until you lose the road\nOr break with the ones you've followed\nHe will do one of two things\nHe will admit to everything\nOr he'll say he's just not the same\nAnd you'll begin to wonder why you came\nWhere did I go wrong?

Though they emerged in a place and time where trippy psychedelic visions were the order of the day, CCR bucked the trends and instead tapped into a rich, traditional seam of American music that connected to blues, country, rockabilly, gospel, folk and R&B.    \n\nDuring their short time together as a band (1968 – 1972), the band enjoyed an unparalleled period of creativity lead by singer, songwriter, arranger John Fogerty. They’ve sold close to 100 million records, releasing 14 Top 10 hits. They also managed to play over 150 tour dates around the world, including a headlining spot at Woodstock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival’s canon has become a part of the Great American Songbook. Fogerty penned songs like “Bad Moon Rising,” “Down on the Corner,” “Fortunate Son,” “Have You Ever Seen the Rain,” “Proud Mary,” “Born on the Bayou,” “Travelin’ Band” and “Up Around the Bend” have been ingrained into pop culture — not just as rock staples, but as classic standards.\n\nWith so many memorable songs that continue to grace our radio waves, television and movie screens, plus lyrics that still resonate today, Creedence Clearwater Revival is, truly, America’s greatest rock ’n’ roll band.\n\n#creedenceclearwaterrevival #ccr #lyrics",

            "description": "Veeronica X Guest 666 『Comic Dub』\n🖤 Honey, please subscribe :3\n🔔 Turn on notifications so you don't miss new videos!\n\nArtist: Me (Rick)\nReference: koi 567, qemars, saikorin\n\nVoice Actor: Me (Rick)\nVoice Actress: Shuzuka\n\nProducer: Saikorin\nTwitter(X): https://x.com/Saikorin_\nDiscord(Not Skype): https://discord.gg/B3kfrVmWBR\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/SaikorinOfficial\n\nDear viewers, you are greeted by part of the team of professional voice acting for anime, films, comics, manga, manhwa and the rest.\n\nShuzuka and I moved to Canada when we were children.\nWe really enjoyed watching anime and cartoons and dreamed of becoming voice actors. Unfortunately, Japan has a very competitive environment among seiyuus. But our voices in English provide translations of anime for different countries, you could hear our voices in a variety of anime.\nWe are currently providing voice-over services for manga and comics, and hope for your support.\n\nOn average, we spend about 14 hours creating one video.\nAt the stage of coming up with an idea, we already begin to sketch out a script in order to save time. At the same time, we are looking for comic book authors and artists who draw manga. After communicating with them, we come up with a title for the video and sketch out a preview. By this point, we have already spent about 4 hours of our time, because in reality this is a very long and tedious process, but very fun. Sometimes I do it alone, but then it takes me about 6 hours (but this is rare).\nThen we assign roles. Usually Shizuka completes the script that we sketched out at the beginning. She constantly watches various tutorials and looks for references so that the original comic has a different meaning. She likes to remake the meaning of the entire story, usually in a humorous way.\nAt this time, I am redrawing most of the comic, according to the redone script, so that the comic ultimately comes out with a completely different meaning. I also spend a huge part of my time redrawing the clothes on the characters and drawing the environment. While drawing, I have to watch a lot of tutorials of different content, since drawing is a rather complicated task. I need to watch instructional videos on YouTube all the time about storyboarding, how to properly draw clothes, human anatomy (sometimes animals) and lighting, as shadows make the drawing better. You need to look through a lot of references in order to choose an idea for clothing, interior design, and simply shading shadows in certain lighting. I absolutely always have all color combinations open on the second monitor. And while Shizuka is finishing the script, I’m preparing a thumbnail for the video. At the end I add dialogue from Shizuka's script. This usually takes us about 6-8 hours. I don't know how much I would have done it alone without Shizuka's help (Maybe 16 hours?).\nAfter everything we've done, we start dubbing the remade comic. Since we are professional voice actors and have been doing voice acting for quite a long time, we make few mistakes. When editing a video, we often have to re-voice some lines, as we may make a mistake with the intonation. Next, I edit the visual part of the comic in Sony Vegas Pro 11, and Shizuka searches for music from the YouTube library and creates an audio track in Ableton Live 11. After we combine our efforts into one project, we press the render button. By this time we had already spent between 13 and 15 hours.\nAfter all of the above, you were able to see this video.\nThank you for supporting us, liking and subscribing to the channel :)\n\nThis video was created for entertainment and humorous purposes only and is not intended to offend anyone!\nAll materials on this channel has been edited by Saikorin.\nWe are not the author of the original, I do not take credit for the materials that were used in this video.\nAll materials have been significantly modified in accordance with the rules of fair use and added to the general plot of the video.\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, \nallowance is made for 'fair use' for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, \nteaching, scholarship, and research.

Desafortunadamente, Japón tiene un entorno muy competitivo entre los seiyuus. Sin embargo, nuestras voces en inglés permiten traducir anime para diferentes países, por lo que podrás escucharnos en una gran variedad de anime.\n\nActualmente ofrecemos servicios de doblaje para manga y cómics, y esperamos contar con tu apoyo.\n\nEn promedio, dedicamos unas 14 horas a la creación de un vídeo.\n\nEn la fase de concepción de la idea, comenzamos a esbozar un guion para ahorrar tiempo. Al mismo tiempo, buscamos autores y dibujantes de manga. Tras comunicarnos con ellos, creamos un título para el vídeo y elaboramos un avance. Para entonces, ya habremos invertido unas 4 horas, ya que, si bien es un proceso largo y laborioso, también es muy divertido. A veces lo hago solo, pero entonces me lleva unas 6 horas (aunque esto es raro).\n\nLuego asignamos los roles. Normalmente, Shizuka completa el guion que esbozamos al principio. Constantemente ve tutoriales y busca referencias para que el cómic original tenga un significado diferente. Le gusta reinterpretar el significado de toda la historia, generalmente con humor.\n\nEn este momento, estoy redibujando la mayor parte del cómic, según el guion revisado, para que el resultado final tenga un significado completamente diferente. También dedico mucho tiempo a redibujar la ropa de los personajes y a dibujar los escenarios. Mientras dibujo, tengo que ver muchos tutoriales de diversos temas, ya que dibujar es una tarea bastante compleja. Necesito ver constantemente videos instructivos en YouTube sobre storyboard, cómo dibujar ropa correctamente, anatomía humana (y a veces animales) e iluminación, ya que las sombras mejoran el dibujo. Hay que consultar muchas referencias para elegir ideas para la ropa, el diseño de interiores y simplemente para sombrear las sombras con cierta iluminación. Siempre tengo todas las combinaciones de colores abiertas en el segundo monitor. Mientras Shizuka termina el guion, preparo una miniatura para el video. Al final, añado los diálogos del guion de Shizuka. Esto suele llevarnos entre 6 y 8 horas. No sé cuánto habría hecho solo sin la ayuda de Shizuka (¿Quizás 16 horas?).\n\nDespués de todo lo que hicimos, empezamos a doblar el cómic rehecho. Como somos actores de doblaje profesionales y llevamos mucho tiempo en esto, cometemos pocos errores. Al editar el vídeo, a menudo tenemos que volver a grabar algunas líneas, ya que podemos equivocarnos con la entonación. Luego, edito la parte visual del cómic en Sony Vegas Pro 11, y Shizuka busca música en la biblioteca de YouTube y crea una pista de audio en Ableton Live 11. Después de combinar nuestros esfuerzos en un solo proyecto, pulsamos el botón de renderizar. Para entonces ya habíamos invertido entre 13 y 15 horas.\n\nDespués de todo esto, pudisteis ver este vídeo.\n\nGracias por apoyarnos, darle a \"Me gusta\" y suscribiros al canal :)\n\nEste vídeo se creó únicamente con fines de entretenimiento y humor, ¡y no pretende ofender a nadie!\n\nTodo el material de este canal ha sido editado por Saikorin.

Мы очень любили смотреть аниме и мультфильмы и мечтали стать сэйю. К сожалению, в Японии очень высокая конкуренция среди сэйю. Но наши голоса на английском языке обеспечивают переводы аниме для разных стран, и вы могли слышать наши голоса в самых разных аниме.\nСейчас мы предоставляем услуги озвучки манги и комиксов и надеемся на вашу поддержку.\n\nВ среднем на создание одного видео мы тратим около 14 часов.\nЕщё на этапе придумывания идеи мы начинаем набрасывать сценарий, чтобы сэкономить время. Параллельно мы ищем авторов комиксов и художников, которые рисуют мангу. После общения с ними мы придумываем название для видео и делаем превью. К этому моменту мы уже потратили около 4 часов своего времени, потому что на самом деле это очень долгий и нудный процесс, но очень увлекательный. Иногда я делаю это одна, но тогда у меня уходит около 6 часов (но это редкость).\nЗатем мы распределяем роли. Обычно Сидзука доделывает сценарий, который мы набросали в начале. Она постоянно смотрит различные туториалы и ищет референсы, чтобы оригинальный комикс приобрел другой смысл. Ей нравится переосмысливать смысл всей истории, обычно в юмористическом ключе.\nСейчас я перерисовываю большую часть комикса по переделанному сценарию, так что в итоге комикс получается с совершенно другим смыслом. Также я трачу огромную часть времени на перерисовку одежды персонажей и прорисовку окружения. Во время рисования мне приходится смотреть множество туториалов разного содержания, так как рисование — довольно сложная задача. Мне постоянно приходится смотреть обучающие видео на YouTube по раскадровке, как правильно рисовать одежду, анатомии человека (иногда и животных) и освещению, ведь тени делают рисунок лучше. Чтобы выбрать идею для одежды, дизайна интерьера и просто растушевки теней при определённом освещении, нужно просмотреть множество референсов. У меня всегда открыты все цветовые сочетания на втором мониторе. Пока Сидзука дописывает сценарий, я готовлю миниатюру для видео. В конце я добавляю диалоги из сценария Сидзуки. Обычно это занимает около 6-8 часов. Не знаю, сколько бы я справился один без помощи Сидзуки (может быть, часов 16?).\nПосле всего этого мы приступаем к озвучиванию переработанного комикса. Поскольку мы профессиональные актёры озвучки и занимаемся этим уже довольно давно, ошибок у нас немного. При монтаже видео нам часто приходится переозвучивать некоторые реплики, так как мы можем ошибиться с интонацией. Далее я монтирую визуальную часть комикса в Sony Vegas Pro 11, а Сидзука ищет музыку из библиотеки YouTube и создаёт звуковую дорожку в Ableton Live 11. Объединив наши усилия в один проект, мы нажимаем кнопку рендеринга. К этому времени мы уже потратили от 13 до 15 часов.\nПосле всего вышеперечисленного вы могли видеть это видео.

നിരന്തരം വിവിധ ട്യൂട്ടോറിയലുകൾ കാണുകയും റഫറൻസുകൾക്കായി നോക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു, അങ്ങനെ യഥാർത്ഥ കോമിക്കിന് വ്യത്യസ്തമായ അർത്ഥമുണ്ട്. കഥയുടെ മുഴുവൻ അർത്ഥവും, സാധാരണയായി നർമ്മം കലർന്ന രീതിയിൽ പുനർനിർമ്മിക്കാൻ അവൾ ഇഷ്ടപ്പെടുന്നു.\nഈ സമയത്ത്, കോമിക്കിന്റെ ഭൂരിഭാഗവും ഞാൻ പുനർനിർമ്മിച്ച സ്ക്രിപ്റ്റ് അനുസരിച്ച് വീണ്ടും വരയ്ക്കുകയാണ്, അങ്ങനെ കോമിക് ഒടുവിൽ തികച്ചും വ്യത്യസ്തമായ അർത്ഥത്തോടെ പുറത്തുവരുന്നു. കഥാപാത്രങ്ങളുടെ വസ്ത്രങ്ങൾ വീണ്ടും വരയ്ക്കുന്നതിനും പരിസ്ഥിതി വരയ്ക്കുന്നതിനും ഞാൻ എന്റെ സമയത്തിന്റെ വലിയൊരു ഭാഗം ചെലവഴിക്കുന്നു. വരയ്ക്കുമ്പോൾ, വ്യത്യസ്ത ഉള്ളടക്കമുള്ള ധാരാളം ട്യൂട്ടോറിയലുകൾ ഞാൻ കാണേണ്ടതുണ്ട്, കാരണം വരയ്ക്കുന്നത് വളരെ സങ്കീർണ്ണമായ ഒരു ജോലിയാണ്. സ്റ്റോറിബോർഡിംഗ്, വസ്ത്രങ്ങൾ എങ്ങനെ ശരിയായി വരയ്ക്കാം, മനുഷ്യ ശരീരഘടന (ചിലപ്പോൾ മൃഗങ്ങൾ), ലൈറ്റിംഗ് എന്നിവയെക്കുറിച്ചുള്ള നിർദ്ദേശ വീഡിയോകൾ ഞാൻ എപ്പോഴും YouTube-ൽ കാണേണ്ടതുണ്ട്, കാരണം നിഴലുകൾ ഡ്രോയിംഗ് മികച്ചതാക്കുന്നു. വസ്ത്രങ്ങൾ, ഇന്റീരിയർ ഡിസൈൻ, ചില ലൈറ്റിംഗിൽ ഷാഡോകൾ ഷേഡ് ചെയ്യുന്നതിനുള്ള ഒരു ആശയം തിരഞ്ഞെടുക്കുന്നതിന് നിങ്ങൾ ധാരാളം റഫറൻസുകൾ പരിശോധിക്കേണ്ടതുണ്ട്. രണ്ടാമത്തെ മോണിറ്ററിൽ എല്ലാ വർണ്ണ കോമ്പിനേഷനുകളും ഞാൻ എപ്പോഴും തുറന്നിരിക്കും. ഷിസുക സ്ക്രിപ്റ്റ് പൂർത്തിയാക്കുമ്പോൾ, വീഡിയോയ്ക്കായി ഞാൻ ഒരു ലഘുചിത്രം തയ്യാറാക്കുകയാണ്. അവസാനം ഞാൻ ഷിസുകയുടെ സ്ക്രിപ്റ്റിൽ നിന്നുള്ള സംഭാഷണം ചേർക്കുന്നു. ഇതിന് സാധാരണയായി ഏകദേശം 6-8 മണിക്കൂർ എടുക്കും. ഷിസുകയുടെ സഹായമില്ലായിരുന്നെങ്കിൽ (ഒരുപക്ഷേ 16 മണിക്കൂർ?) ഞാൻ ഒറ്റയ്ക്ക് ഇത് എത്രത്തോളം ചെയ്യുമായിരുന്നുവെന്ന് എനിക്കറിയില്ല.\nഞങ്ങൾ എല്ലാം ചെയ്തുകഴിഞ്ഞാൽ, പുനർനിർമ്മിച്ച കോമിക് ഡബ്ബ് ചെയ്യാൻ തുടങ്ങുന്നു. ഞങ്ങൾ പ്രൊഫഷണൽ വോയ്‌സ് അഭിനേതാക്കളായതിനാലും വളരെക്കാലമായി വോയ്‌സ് ആക്ടിംഗ് ചെയ്യുന്നതിനാലും, ഞങ്ങൾക്ക് കുറച്ച് തെറ്റുകൾ മാത്രമേ സംഭവിക്കൂ. ഒരു വീഡിയോ എഡിറ്റ് ചെയ്യുമ്പോൾ, പലപ്പോഴും ചില വരികൾ വീണ്ടും വോയ്‌സ് ചെയ്യേണ്ടിവരും, കാരണം നമുക്ക് സ്വരസൂചകത്തിൽ തെറ്റ് സംഭവിക്കാം. അടുത്തതായി, സോണി വെഗാസ് പ്രോ 11-ൽ കോമിക്കിന്റെ ദൃശ്യ ഭാഗം ഞാൻ എഡിറ്റ് ചെയ്യുന്നു, ഷിസുക YouTube ലൈബ്രറിയിൽ നിന്ന് സംഗീതത്തിനായി തിരയുകയും ആബ്ലെട്ടൺ ലൈവ് 11-ൽ ഒരു ഓഡിയോ ട്രാക്ക് സൃഷ്ടിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു. ഞങ്ങളുടെ ശ്രമങ്ങൾ ഒരു പ്രോജക്റ്റിലേക്ക് സംയോജിപ്പിച്ച ശേഷം, ഞങ്ങൾ റെൻഡർ ബട്ടൺ അമർത്തുന്നു. ഈ സമയം ഞങ്ങൾ ഇതിനകം 13 നും 15 നും ഇടയിൽ ചെലവഴിച്ചു.\nമുകളിൽ പറഞ്ഞതെല്ലാം കഴിഞ്ഞ്, നിങ്ങൾക്ക് ഈ വീഡിയോ കാണാൻ കഴിഞ്ഞു.\nഞങ്ങളെ പിന്തുണച്ചതിനും ചാനൽ ലൈക്ക് ചെയ്തതിനും സബ്‌സ്‌ക്രൈബ് ചെയ്തതിനും നന്ദി :)\n\nഈ വീഡിയോ വിനോദത്തിനും നർമ്മത്തിനും വേണ്ടി മാത്രമാണ് സൃഷ്ടിച്ചത്, ആരെയും വ്രണപ്പെടുത്താൻ ഉദ്ദേശിച്ചുള്ളതല്ല!\nഈ ചാനലിലെ എല്ലാ മെറ്റീരിയലുകളും സായികോറിൻ എഡിറ്റ് ചെയ്തിട്ടുണ്ട്.\nഞങ്ങൾ ഒറിജിനലിന്റെ രചയിതാവല്ല, ഈ വീഡിയോയിൽ ഉപയോഗിച്ചിരിക്കുന്ന മെറ്റീരിയലുകൾക്ക് ഞാൻ ക്രെഡിറ്റ് എടുക്കുന്നില്ല.\n\nഎല്ലാ മെറ്റീരിയലുകളും ന്യായമായ ഉപയോഗ നിയമങ്ങൾക്കനുസൃതമായി ഗണ്യമായി പരിഷ്‌ക്കരിക്കുകയും വീഡിയോയുടെ പൊതുവായ പ്ലോട്ടിൽ ചേർക്കുകയും

நடிப்பு குழுவின் ஒரு பகுதியினர் உங்களை வரவேற்கிறார்கள்.\n\nநாங்கள் குழந்தைகளாக இருந்தபோது ஷுசுகாவும் நானும் கனடாவுக்கு குடிபெயர்ந்தோம்.\nநாங்கள் அனிம் மற்றும் கார்ட்டூன்களைப் பார்த்து மிகவும் மகிழ்ந்தோம், குரல் நடிகர்களாக வேண்டும் என்று கனவு கண்டோம். துரதிர்ஷ்டவசமாக, ஜப்பானில் சீயுஸ் மத்தியில் மிகவும் போட்டி நிறைந்த சூழல் உள்ளது. ஆனால் எங்கள் ஆங்கிலக் குரல்கள் வெவ்வேறு நாடுகளுக்கான அனிமேஷின் மொழிபெயர்ப்புகளை வழங்குகின்றன, பல்வேறு அனிமேஷில் எங்கள் குரல்களை நீங்கள் கேட்கலாம்.\n\nதற்போது நாங்கள் மங்கா மற்றும் காமிக்ஸுக்கு குரல் கொடுக்கும் சேவைகளை வழங்கி வருகிறோம், மேலும் உங்கள் ஆதரவை எதிர்பார்க்கிறோம்.\n\nசராசரியாக, ஒரு வீடியோவை உருவாக்க சுமார் 14 மணிநேரம் செலவிடுகிறோம்.\nஒரு யோசனை வரும் கட்டத்தில், நேரத்தை மிச்சப்படுத்துவதற்காக நாங்கள் ஏற்கனவே ஒரு ஸ்கிரிப்டை வரையத் தொடங்குகிறோம். அதே நேரத்தில், மங்காவை வரைந்த காமிக் புத்தக ஆசிரியர்கள் மற்றும் கலைஞர்களை நாங்கள் தேடுகிறோம். அவர்களுடன் தொடர்பு கொண்ட பிறகு, வீடியோவிற்கு ஒரு தலைப்பைக் கொண்டு வந்து ஒரு முன்னோட்டத்தை வரைகிறோம். இந்த கட்டத்தில், நாங்கள் ஏற்கனவே எங்கள் நேரத்தில் சுமார் 4 மணிநேரம் செலவிட்டுள்ளோம், ஏனெனில் உண்மையில் இது மிக நீண்ட மற்றும் கடினமான செயல்முறை, ஆனால் மிகவும் வேடிக்கையாக உள்ளது. சில நேரங்களில் நான் அதை தனியாகச் செய்கிறேன், ஆனால் அது எனக்கு சுமார் 6 மணிநேரம் ஆகும் (ஆனால் இது அரிதானது).\nபின்னர் நாங்கள் பாத்திரங்களை ஒதுக்குகிறோம். வழக்கமாக ஷிசுகா ஆரம்பத்தில் நாங்கள் வரைந்த ஸ்கிரிப்டை முடிக்கிறார். அவர் தொடர்ந்து பல்வேறு பயிற்சிகளைப் பார்க்கிறார் மற்றும் குறிப்புகளைத் தேடுகிறார், இதனால் அசல் காமிக் வேறு அர்த்தத்தைக் கொண்டிருக்கும். முழு கதையின் அர்த்தத்தையும், பொதுவாக நகைச்சுவையான முறையில் மீண்டும் உருவாக்க அவள் விரும்புகிறாள்.\n\nஇந்த நேரத்தில், நான் பெரும்பாலான நகைச்சுவையை, மீண்டும் வரைந்த ஸ்கிரிப்ட்டின் படி மீண்டும் வரைகிறேன், இதனால் காமிக் இறுதியில் முற்றிலும் மாறுபட்ட அர்த்தத்துடன் வெளிவருகிறது. கதாபாத்திரங்களின் மீது ஆடைகளை மீண்டும் வரைவதற்கும் சூழலை வரைவதற்கும் எனது நேரத்தின் பெரும் பகுதியை செலவிடுகிறேன். வரையும்போது, ​​வரைவது மிகவும் சிக்கலான பணி என்பதால், வெவ்வேறு உள்ளடக்கங்களைக் கொண்ட பல பயிற்சிகளை நான் பார்க்க வேண்டும். ஸ்டோரிபோர்டிங், துணிகளை எவ்வாறு சரியாக வரைய வேண்டும், மனித உடற்கூறியல் (சில நேரங்களில் விலங்குகள்) மற்றும் லைட்டிங் பற்றிய அறிவுறுத்தல் வீடியோக்களை நான் எப்போதும் YouTube இல் பார்க்க வேண்டும், ஏனெனில் நிழல்கள் வரைபடத்தை சிறப்பாக்குகின்றன. ஆடை, உட்புற வடிவமைப்பு மற்றும் குறிப்பிட்ட வெளிச்சத்தில் நிழல்களை நிழலிடுவதற்கான யோசனையைத் தேர்வுசெய்ய நீங்கள் நிறைய குறிப்புகளைப் பார்க்க வேண்டும். நான் எப்போதும் இரண்டாவது மானிட்டரில் அனைத்து வண்ண சேர்க்கைகளையும் திறந்திருப்பேன். ஷிசுகா ஸ்கிரிப்டை முடிக்கும்போது, ​​வீடியோவிற்கான சிறுபடத்தை நான் தயார் செய்கிறேன். இறுதியில் ஷிசுகாவின் ஸ்கிரிப்டிலிருந்து உரையாடலைச் சேர்க்கிறேன். இது பொதுவாக எங்களுக்கு 6-8 மணிநேரம் ஆகும். ஷிசுகாவின் உதவி இல்லாமல் நான் இதை எவ்வளவு செய்திருப்பேன் என்று எனக்குத் தெரியவில்லை (ஒருவேளை 16 மணிநேரம்?).\nநாங்கள் செய்த அனைத்திற்கும் பிறகு, ரீமேக் செய்யப்பட்ட காமிக்ஸை டப்பிங் செய்யத் தொடங்குகிறோம். நாங்கள் தொழில்முறை குரல் நடிகர்கள் மற்றும் நீண்ட காலமாக குரல் நடிப்பைச் செய்து வருவதால், நாங்கள் சில தவறுகளைச் செய்கிறோம். ஒரு வீடியோவைத் திருத்தும்போது, ​​நாம் பெரும்பாலும் சில வரிகளை மீண்டும் குரல் கொடுக்க வேண்டியிருக்கும், ஏனெனில் நாம் ஒலிப்புடன் தவறு செய்யலாம். அடுத்து, நான் சோனி வேகாஸ் ப்ரோ 11 இல் காமிக்ஸின் காட்சிப் பகுதியைத் திருத்துகிறேன், மேலும் ஷிசுகா யூடியூப் நூலகத்திலிருந்து இசையைத் தேடி, Ableton Live 11 இல் ஒரு ஆடியோ டிராக்கை உருவாக்குகிறார். எங்கள் முயற்சிகளை ஒரு திட்டமாக இணைத்த பிறகு, நாங்கள் ரெண்டர் பொத்தானை அழுத்துகிறோம். இந்த நேரத்தில் நாங்கள் ஏற்கனவே 13 முதல் 15 மணிநேரம் வரை செலவிட்டிருந்தோம்.\nமேற்கூறிய அனைத்திற்கும் பிறகு, இந்த வீடியோவை நீங்கள் பார்க்க முடிந்தது.\nஎங்களை ஆதரித்ததற்கும், சேனலை விரும்புவதற்கும், சந்தா செலுத்துவதற்கும் நன்றி :)\n\nஇந்த வீடியோ பொழுதுபோக்கு மற்றும் நகைச்சுவை

Purtroppo, il Giappone ha un ambiente molto competitivo tra i doppiatori. Ma le nostre voci in inglese forniscono traduzioni di anime per diversi paesi, quindi potete sentire le nostre voci in una varietà di anime.\nAttualmente forniamo servizi di doppiaggio per manga e fumetti e confidiamo nel vostro supporto.\n\nIn media, impieghiamo circa 14 ore per creare un video.\nNella fase di ideazione, iniziamo già a delineare una sceneggiatura per risparmiare tempo. Allo stesso tempo, cerchiamo autori e disegnatori di fumetti che disegnino manga. Dopo aver parlato con loro, troviamo un titolo per il video e ne abbozziamo un'anteprima. A questo punto, abbiamo già dedicato circa 4 ore del nostro tempo, perché in realtà è un processo molto lungo e noioso, ma molto divertente. A volte lo faccio da sola, ma in quel caso ci metto circa 6 ore (ma è raro).\nPoi assegniamo i ruoli. Di solito Shizuka completa la sceneggiatura che abbiamo abbozzato all'inizio. Guarda costantemente vari tutorial e cerca riferimenti in modo che il fumetto originale abbia un significato diverso. Le piace rivisitare il significato dell'intera storia, di solito in modo umoristico.\nIn questo momento, sto ridisegnando gran parte del fumetto, seguendo la sceneggiatura rielaborata, in modo che il fumetto alla fine abbia un significato completamente diverso. Dedico anche gran parte del mio tempo a ridisegnare gli abiti dei personaggi e a disegnare l'ambiente. Mentre disegno, devo guardare molti tutorial di vario tipo, dato che disegnare è un compito piuttosto complicato. Devo guardare continuamente video didattici su YouTube sullo storyboard, su come disegnare correttamente i vestiti, sull'anatomia umana (a volte anche quella degli animali) e sull'illuminazione, poiché le ombre migliorano il disegno. Bisogna consultare molti riferimenti per scegliere un'idea per l'abbigliamento, l'interior design e semplicemente per sfumare le ombre in determinate condizioni di luce. Tengo sempre aperte tutte le combinazioni di colori sul secondo monitor. E mentre Shizuka finisce la sceneggiatura, preparo un'anteprima per il video. Alla fine aggiungo i dialoghi dalla sceneggiatura di Shizuka. Di solito ci vogliono circa 6-8 ore. Non so quanto avrei fatto da sola senza l'aiuto di Shizuka (forse 16 ore?).\nDopo tutto quello che abbiamo fatto, iniziamo a doppiare il fumetto rifatto. Dato che siamo doppiatori professionisti e ci occupiamo di doppiaggio da parecchio tempo, commettiamo pochi errori. Quando modifichiamo un video, spesso dobbiamo rifare alcune battute, perché potremmo sbagliare l'intonazione. Poi, modifico la parte visiva del fumetto in Sony Vegas Pro 11, e Shizuka cerca la musica dalla libreria di YouTube e crea una traccia audio in Ableton Live 11. Dopo aver unito i nostri sforzi in un unico progetto, premiamo il pulsante di rendering. A questo punto avevamo già impiegato tra le 13 e le 15 ore.\nDopo tutto quanto sopra, siete riusciti a vedere questo video.\nGrazie per il vostro supporto, per aver messo \"Mi piace\" e per esservi iscritti al canale :)\n\nQuesto video è stato creato solo a scopo di intrattenimento e umorismo e non intende offendere nessuno!\nTutto il materiale su questo canale è stato modificato da Saikorin.\nNon siamo gli autori dell'originale, non mi assumo il merito del materiale utilizzato in questo video.\nTutti i materiali sono stati significativamente modificati in conformità con le regole del fair use e aggiunti alla trama generale del video.\n\n\"Informativa sul copyright Ai sensi dell'articolo 107 del Copyright Act del 1976,\nè consentito il \"fair use\" per scopi quali critica, commento, informazione,\ninsegnamento, borse di studio e ricerca.

Naprawdę lubiliśmy oglądać anime i kreskówki i marzyliśmy o zostaniu aktorami głosowymi. Niestety, w Japonii panuje bardzo duża konkurencja wśród seiyuu. Jednak nasze głosy w języku angielskim zapewniają tłumaczenia anime dla różnych krajów, więc można było usłyszeć nasze głosy w wielu anime.\nObecnie świadczymy usługi dubbingu mangi i komiksów i liczymy na Wasze wsparcie.\n\nŚrednio spędzamy około 14 godzin na stworzenie jednego filmu.\nNa etapie wpadania na pomysł, zaczynamy już szkicować scenariusz, aby zaoszczędzić czas. Jednocześnie poszukujemy autorów komiksów i rysowników mangi. Po rozmowie z nimi, wymyślamy tytuł filmu i szkicujemy wstęp. Na tym etapie poświęcamy już około 4 godzin, ponieważ w rzeczywistości jest to bardzo długi i żmudny proces, ale bardzo przyjemny. Czasami robię to sam, ale wtedy zajmuje mi to około 6 godzin (ale to rzadkość).\nPotem przydzielamy role. Zazwyczaj Shizuka kończy scenariusz, który naszkicowaliśmy na początku. Ciągle ogląda różne tutoriale i szuka odniesień, aby oryginalny komiks miał inne znaczenie. Lubi przerabiać sens całej historii, zazwyczaj w humorystyczny sposób.\nW tej chwili przerysowuję większość komiksu zgodnie z przerobionym scenariuszem, aby ostatecznie komiks miał zupełnie inne znaczenie. Spędzam też dużo czasu na przerysowywaniu ubrań postaci i rysowaniu otoczenia. Podczas rysowania muszę oglądać wiele tutoriali o różnej tematyce, ponieważ rysowanie jest dość skomplikowanym zadaniem. Muszę ciągle oglądać filmy instruktażowe na YouTube o tworzeniu storyboardów, prawidłowym rysowaniu ubrań, anatomii człowieka (czasem zwierząt) i oświetleniu, ponieważ cienie poprawiają rysunek. Trzeba przejrzeć wiele odniesień, aby wybrać pomysł na ubranie, wystrój wnętrz i po prostu cieniowanie cieni w określonym oświetleniu. Absolutnie zawsze mam otwarte wszystkie kombinacje kolorów na drugim monitorze. A podczas gdy Shizuka kończy scenariusz, ja przygotowuję miniaturę do filmu. Na koniec dodaję dialogi ze scenariusza Shizuki. Zazwyczaj zajmuje nam to około 6-8 godzin. Nie wiem, ile zrobiłbym sam bez pomocy Shizuki (może 16 godzin?).\nPo tym wszystkim, co zrobiliśmy, zaczynamy dubbingować przerobiony komiks. Ponieważ jesteśmy profesjonalnymi aktorami głosowymi i zajmujemy się tym od dłuższego czasu, popełniamy niewiele błędów. Podczas montażu filmu często musimy ponownie podkładać głosy, ponieważ możemy popełnić błąd w intonacji. Następnie edytuję wizualną część komiksu w Sony Vegas Pro 11, a Shizuka wyszukuje muzykę z biblioteki YouTube i tworzy ścieżkę audio w Ableton Live 11. Po połączeniu naszych wysiłków w jeden projekt, naciskamy przycisk renderowania.

На жаль, у Японії дуже конкурентне середовище серед сейю. Але наші голоси англійською мовою забезпечують переклади аніме для різних країн, ви могли почути наші голоси в різноманітних аніме.\n\nНаразі ми надаємо послуги озвучування манги та коміксів і сподіваємося на вашу підтримку.\n\nВ середньому ми витрачаємо близько 14 годин на створення одного відео.\nНа етапі зародження ідеї ми вже починаємо накидати сценарій, щоб заощадити час. Водночас ми шукаємо авторів коміксів та художників, які малюють мангу. Після спілкування з ними ми придумуємо назву для відео та накидаємо прев'ю. На цей момент ми вже витратили близько 4 годин нашого часу, тому що насправді це дуже довгий і виснажливий процес, але дуже веселий. Іноді я роблю це сама, але тоді у мене це займає близько 6 годин (але це рідко).\nПотім ми розподіляємо ролі. Зазвичай Шідзука завершує сценарій, який ми накидали на початку. Вона постійно дивиться різні навчальні відео та шукає посилання, щоб оригінальний комікс мав інший зміст. Їй подобається переробляти зміст усієї історії, зазвичай у гумористичному ключі.\nНаразі я перемальовую більшу частину коміксу, згідно з переробленим сценарієм, щоб комікс зрештою вийшов з зовсім іншим змістом. Також я витрачаю величезну частину свого часу на перемальовування одягу на персонажах та малювання оточення. Під час малювання мені доводиться дивитися багато навчальних відео різного змісту, оскільки малювання – це досить складне завдання. Мені постійно потрібно дивитися навчальні відео на YouTube про розкадровку, як правильно малювати одяг, анатомію людини (іноді тварин) та освітлення, оскільки тіні роблять малюнок кращим. Потрібно переглянути багато посилань, щоб вибрати ідею для одягу, дизайну інтер'єру та просто затінення тіней при певному освітленні. У мене абсолютно завжди відкриті всі колірні комбінації на другому моніторі. А поки Шідзука закінчує сценарій, я готую мініатюру для відео. В кінці я додаю діалоги зі сценарію Шідзуки. Зазвичай це займає у нас близько 6-8 годин. Не знаю, скільки б я зробив сам без допомоги Шідзуки (Можливо, 16 годин?). Після всього, що ми зробили, ми починаємо дублювати перероблений комікс. Оскільки ми професійні актори озвучування і займаємося озвучуванням вже досить давно, ми робимо мало помилок. Під час монтажу відео нам часто доводиться переозвучувати деякі репліки, оскільки ми можемо помилитися з інтонацією. Далі я редагую візуальну частину коміксів у Sony Vegas Pro 11, а Шізука шукає музику з бібліотеки YouTube і створює аудіодоріжку в Ableton Live 11. Після того, як ми об'єднуємо наші зусилля в один проект, ми натискаємо кнопку рендерингу. На цей час ми вже витратили від 13 до 15 годин.\nПісля всього вищесказаного ви змогли переглянути це відео.\nДякуємо, що підтримуєте нас, ставите лайки та підписуєтесь на канал :)\n\nЦе відео створено виключно для розважальних та гумористичних цілей і не має на меті когось образити!\nУсі матеріали на цьому каналі відредагував Saikorin.\nМи не є автором оригіналу, я не приписую себе авторству за матеріали, які були використані в цьому відео.\nУсі матеріали були суттєво змінені відповідно до правил добросовісного використання та додані до загального сюжету відео.\n\n«Застереження щодо авторських прав.

Leider herrscht in Japan ein sehr wettbewerbsintensiver Markt für Synchronsprecher. Da wir aber englische Übersetzungen von Anime in verschiedene Länder anbieten, könnt ihr unsere Stimmen in einer Vielzahl von Anime hören.\nWir bieten derzeit Synchronisationsdienste für Manga und Comics an und hoffen auf eure Unterstützung.\n\nIm Durchschnitt benötigen wir etwa 14 Stunden für die Produktion eines Videos. Bereits in der Ideenphase beginnen wir mit dem Skizzieren eines Skripts, um Zeit zu sparen. Parallel dazu suchen wir nach Comiczeichnern und Mangaka. Nach der Kommunikation mit ihnen entwickeln wir einen Titel für das Video und erstellen eine Vorschau. Bis dahin haben wir bereits etwa vier Stunden investiert, denn in Wirklichkeit ist es ein sehr langer und mühsamer, aber auch sehr unterhaltsamer Prozess. Manchmal arbeite ich alleine daran, dann benötige ich aber etwa sechs Stunden (was jedoch selten vorkommt). Anschließend verteilen wir die Rollen. Normalerweise vervollständigt Shizuka das Skript, das wir zu Beginn skizziert haben. Sie schaut sich ständig verschiedene Tutorials an und sucht nach Referenzen, um dem Original-Comic eine neue Bedeutung zu verleihen. Sie mag es, die Bedeutung der gesamten Geschichte neu zu interpretieren, meist auf humorvolle Weise.\nIm Moment zeichne ich den Großteil des Comics anhand des überarbeiteten Skripts neu, sodass er am Ende eine völlig andere Bedeutung hat. Ich verbringe auch viel Zeit damit, die Kleidung der Charaktere und die Umgebung neu zu zeichnen. Während des Zeichnens muss ich mir viele Tutorials zu verschiedenen Themen ansehen, da Zeichnen eine ziemlich komplexe Angelegenheit ist. Ich schaue mir ständig Lehrvideos auf YouTube an, zum Beispiel zu Storyboarding, zum richtigen Zeichnen von Kleidung, zur menschlichen Anatomie (manchmal auch von Tieren) und zur Lichtsetzung, da Schatten die Zeichnung verbessern. Man muss sich viele Referenzen ansehen, um Ideen für Kleidung, Inneneinrichtung und einfach nur für die Schattierung bei bestimmten Lichtverhältnissen zu finden. Ich habe immer alle Farbkombinationen auf dem zweiten Monitor geöffnet. Und während Shizuka das Skript fertigstellt, erstelle ich ein Vorschaubild für das Video. Zum Schluss füge ich die Dialoge aus Shizukas Skript hinzu. Das dauert normalerweise etwa sechs bis acht Stunden. Ich weiß nicht, wie lange ich es ohne Shizukas Hilfe allein geschafft hätte (vielleicht 16 Stunden?).\nNachdem wir alles erledigt hatten, begannen wir mit der Synchronisation des neu bearbeiteten Comics. Da wir professionelle Synchronsprecher sind und schon lange im Geschäft sind, unterliefen uns nur wenige Fehler. Beim Bearbeiten des Videos mussten wir oft einige Zeilen nachsprechen, da wir uns bei der Intonation vertippen konnten. Anschließend bearbeitete ich den visuellen Teil des Comics in Sony Vegas Pro 11, und Shizuka suchte Musik in der YouTube-Bibliothek und erstellte eine Audiospur in Ableton Live 11. Nachdem wir unsere Arbeit zu einem Projekt zusammengeführt hatten, drückten wir auf den Render-Button. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatten wir bereits zwischen 13 und 15 Stunden investiert.\n\nNach all dem konntet ihr dieses Video sehen.\n\nVielen Dank für eure Unterstützung, eure Likes und eure Abonnements! :)\n\nDieses Video dient ausschließlich der Unterhaltung und soll niemanden beleidigen!\nAlle Inhalte auf diesem Kanal wurden von Saikorin bearbeitet.\n\nWir sind nicht die Urheber des Originals und beanspruchen keinerlei Urheberrechte an den in diesem Video verwendeten Materialien.\nSämtliches Material wurde im Rahmen der zulässigen Nutzung (Fair Use) erheblich bearbeitet und in die Handlung des Videos integriert.\n\n„Urheberrechtshinweis gemäß § 107 des US-amerikanischen Urheberrechtsgesetzes von 1976:\nDie zulässige Nutzung (Fair Use) ist für Zwecke wie Kritik, Kommentare, Berichterstattung,\nLehre, Wissenschaft und Forschung gestattet.

Helaas is er in Japan een zeer competitieve omgeving onder seiyuus. Maar onze stemmen in het Engels verzorgen vertalingen van anime voor verschillende landen; je kon onze stemmen in diverse animes horen.\nWe leveren momenteel voice-overdiensten voor manga en strips en hopen op jouw steun.\n\nGemiddeld besteden we ongeveer 14 uur aan het maken van één video.\nIn de fase van het bedenken van een idee beginnen we al met het schetsen van een script om tijd te besparen. Tegelijkertijd zijn we op zoek naar stripauteurs en tekenaars die manga tekenen. Na overleg met hen bedenken we een titel voor de video en schetsen we een preview. Op dit punt hebben we al ongeveer 4 uur van onze tijd besteed, want in werkelijkheid is dit een heel lang en vervelend proces, maar erg leuk. Soms doe ik het alleen, maar dan kost het me ongeveer 6 uur (maar dat komt zelden voor).\nDaarna verdelen we de rollen. Meestal maakt Shizuka het script af dat we in het begin hebben geschetst. Ze bekijkt constant verschillende tutorials en zoekt naar referenties, zodat de originele strip een andere betekenis krijgt. Ze vindt het leuk om de betekenis van het hele verhaal te herschrijven, meestal op een humoristische manier.\nOp dit moment teken ik het grootste deel van de strip opnieuw, volgens het vernieuwde script, zodat de strip uiteindelijk een compleet andere betekenis krijgt. Ik besteed ook een groot deel van mijn tijd aan het opnieuw tekenen van de kleding van de personages en het tekenen van de omgeving. Tijdens het tekenen moet ik veel tutorials met verschillende inhoud bekijken, omdat tekenen een vrij ingewikkelde taak is. Ik moet constant instructievideo's op YouTube bekijken over storyboarding, hoe je kleding correct tekent, menselijke anatomie (soms dieren) en belichting, omdat schaduwen de tekening beter maken. Je moet veel referenties bekijken om een ​​idee te kiezen voor kleding, interieurontwerp en simpelweg het schaduwen van schaduwen bij bepaalde belichting. Ik heb absoluut altijd alle kleurencombinaties openstaan ​​op de tweede monitor. En terwijl Shizuka het script afmaakt, bereid ik een thumbnail voor de video voor. Aan het einde voeg ik dialogen uit Shizuka's script toe. Dit kost ons meestal zo'n 6-8 uur. Ik weet niet hoeveel ik het alleen had gedaan zonder Shizuka's hulp (misschien 16 uur?).\nNa alles wat we gedaan hebben, beginnen we met het nasynchroniseren van de nieuwe strip. Omdat we professionele stemacteurs zijn en al geruime tijd voice-acting doen, maken we weinig fouten. Bij het bewerken van een video moeten we vaak wat tekst opnieuw inspreken, omdat we een fout met de intonatie kunnen maken. Vervolgens bewerk ik het visuele gedeelte van de strip in Sony Vegas Pro 11, en Shizuka zoekt muziek in de YouTube-bibliotheek en maakt een audiotrack in Ableton Live 11. Nadat we onze krachten bundelen tot één project, drukken we op de renderknop. Tegen die tijd hadden we er al tussen de 13 en 15 uur aan besteed.\nNa al het bovenstaande heb je deze video kunnen bekijken.\nBedankt voor je steun, je like en je abonnering op het kanaal :)\n\nDeze video is uitsluitend gemaakt voor entertainment en humor en is niet bedoeld om iemand te beledigen!

Sayangnya, Jepang memiliki lingkungan yang sangat kompetitif di antara para seiyuu. Namun, tim pengisi suara kami dalam bahasa Inggris menyediakan terjemahan anime untuk berbagai negara, dan Anda dapat mendengarkan suara kami di berbagai anime.\nSaat ini kami menyediakan layanan sulih suara untuk manga dan komik, dan kami mengharapkan dukungan Anda.\n\nRata-rata, kami menghabiskan sekitar 14 jam untuk membuat satu video.\nPada tahap menemukan ide, kami sudah mulai membuat sketsa naskah untuk menghemat waktu. Pada saat yang sama, kami mencari penulis dan seniman komik yang menggambar manga. Setelah berkomunikasi dengan mereka, kami membuat judul untuk video dan membuat sketsa pratinjau. Saat ini, kami telah menghabiskan sekitar 4 jam, karena pada kenyataannya ini adalah proses yang sangat panjang dan membosankan, tetapi sangat menyenangkan. Terkadang saya melakukannya sendiri, tetapi terkadang membutuhkan waktu sekitar 6 jam (tetapi ini jarang terjadi).\nKemudian kami menetapkan peran. Biasanya Shizuka menyelesaikan naskah yang telah kami sketsa di awal. Dia terus-menerus menonton berbagai tutorial dan mencari referensi agar komik aslinya memiliki makna yang berbeda. Dia suka mengulang makna keseluruhan cerita, biasanya dengan cara yang lucu.\nSaat ini, saya sedang menggambar ulang sebagian besar komik, sesuai dengan naskah yang telah direvisi, sehingga komik tersebut pada akhirnya memiliki makna yang sama sekali berbeda. Saya juga menghabiskan banyak waktu untuk menggambar ulang pakaian karakter dan lingkungan sekitar. Sambil menggambar, saya harus menonton banyak tutorial dengan konten yang berbeda, karena menggambar adalah tugas yang agak rumit. Saya perlu menonton video tutorial di YouTube setiap saat tentang pembuatan storyboard, cara menggambar pakaian yang benar, anatomi manusia (terkadang hewan), dan pencahayaan, karena bayangan akan membuat gambar lebih baik. Kita perlu melihat banyak referensi untuk memilih ide pakaian, desain interior, dan hanya perlu mengarsir bayangan dalam pencahayaan tertentu. Saya selalu membuka semua kombinasi warna di monitor kedua. Dan sementara Shizuka menyelesaikan naskah, saya sedang mempersiapkan thumbnail untuk video tersebut. Di akhir, saya menambahkan dialog dari naskah Shizuka. Proses ini biasanya memakan waktu sekitar 6-8 jam. Saya tidak tahu berapa lama saya bisa menyelesaikannya sendiri tanpa bantuan Shizuka (Mungkin 16 jam?).\nSetelah semua yang kami lakukan, kami mulai mengisi suara komik yang telah dibuat ulang. Karena kami adalah pengisi suara profesional dan telah lama berkecimpung di dunia akting suara, kami jarang membuat kesalahan. Saat mengedit video, kami sering kali harus mengisi ulang beberapa baris, karena mungkin ada kesalahan intonasi. Selanjutnya, saya mengedit bagian visual komik di Sony Vegas Pro 11, dan Shizuka mencari musik dari pustaka YouTube dan membuat trek audio di Ableton Live 11. Setelah kami menggabungkan semua upaya kami menjadi satu proyek, kami menekan tombol render. Saat itu kami telah menghabiskan waktu antara 13 dan 15 jam.\nSetelah semua hal di atas, Anda dapat melihat video ini.\nTerima kasih telah mendukung kami, menyukai, dan berlangganan kanal ini :)\n\nVideo ini dibuat hanya untuk tujuan hiburan dan humor dan tidak dimaksudkan untuk menyinggung siapa pun!\nSemua materi di kanal ini telah diedit oleh Saikorin.

                "description": "Veeronica X Guest 666 『Comic Dub』\n🖤 Honey, please subscribe :3\n🔔 Turn on notifications so you don't miss new videos!\n\nArtist: Me (Rick)\nReference: koi 567, qemars, saikorin\n\nVoice Actor: Me (Rick)\nVoice Actress: Shuzuka\n\nProducer: Saikorin\nTwitter(X): https://x.com/Saikorin_\nDiscord(Not Skype): https://discord.gg/B3kfrVmWBR\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/SaikorinOfficial\n\nDear viewers, you are greeted by part of the team of professional voice acting for anime, films, comics, manga, manhwa and the rest.\n\nShuzuka and I moved to Canada when we were children.\nWe really enjoyed watching anime and cartoons and dreamed of becoming voice actors. Unfortunately, Japan has a very competitive environment among seiyuus. But our voices in English provide translations of anime for different countries, you could hear our voices in a variety of anime.\nWe are currently providing voice-over services for manga and comics, and hope for your support.\n\nOn average, we spend about 14 hours creating one video.\nAt the stage of coming up with an idea, we already begin to sketch out a script in order to save time. At the same time, we are looking for comic book authors and artists who draw manga. After communicating with them, we come up with a title for the video and sketch out a preview. By this point, we have already spent about 4 hours of our time, because in reality this is a very long and tedious process, but very fun. Sometimes I do it alone, but then it takes me about 6 hours (but this is rare).\nThen we assign roles. Usually Shizuka completes the script that we sketched out at the beginning. She constantly watches various tutorials and looks for references so that the original comic has a different meaning. She likes to remake the meaning of the entire story, usually in a humorous way.\nAt this time, I am redrawing most of the comic, according to the redone script, so that the comic ultimately comes out with a completely different meaning. I also spend a huge part of my time redrawing the clothes on the characters and drawing the environment. While drawing, I have to watch a lot of tutorials of different content, since drawing is a rather complicated task. I need to watch instructional videos on YouTube all the time about storyboarding, how to properly draw clothes, human anatomy (sometimes animals) and lighting, as shadows make the drawing better. You need to look through a lot of references in order to choose an idea for clothing, interior design, and simply shading shadows in certain lighting. I absolutely always have all color combinations open on the second monitor. And while Shizuka is finishing the script, I’m preparing a thumbnail for the video. At the end I add dialogue from Shizuka's script. This usually takes us about 6-8 hours. I don't know how much I would have done it alone without Shizuka's help (Maybe 16 hours?).\nAfter everything we've done, we start dubbing the remade comic. Since we are professional voice actors and have been doing voice acting for quite a long time, we make few mistakes. When editing a video, we often have to re-voice some lines, as we may make a mistake with the intonation. Next, I edit the visual part of the comic in Sony Vegas Pro 11, and Shizuka searches for music from the YouTube library and creates an audio track in Ableton Live 11. After we combine our efforts into one project, we press the render button. By this time we had already spent between 13 and 15 hours.\nAfter all of the above, you were able to see this video.\nThank you for supporting us, liking and subscribing to the channel :)\n\nThis video was created for entertainment and humorous purposes only and is not intended to offend anyone!\nAll materials on this channel has been edited by Saikorin.\nWe are not the author of the original, I do not take credit for the materials that were used in this video.\nAll materials have been significantly modified in accordance with the rules of fair use and added to the general plot of the video.\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, \nallowance is made for 'fair use' for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, \nteaching, scholarship, and research.

Malheureusement, le Japon est un secteur très concurrentiel pour les seiyuus. Cependant, nos voix en anglais permettent de traduire des animes pour différents pays, et vous pouvez donc entendre nos voix dans une grande variété d'œuvres.\n\nNous proposons actuellement des services de doublage pour les mangas et les bandes dessinées, et nous espérons votre soutien.\n\nEn moyenne, nous consacrons environ 14 heures à la création d'une vidéo.\n\nDès la phase de conception, nous commençons à esquisser un script afin de gagner du temps. Parallèlement, nous recherchons des auteurs et des dessinateurs de mangas. Après avoir échangé avec eux, nous trouvons un titre pour la vidéo et réalisons une maquette. À ce stade, nous avons déjà investi environ 4 heures, car c'est un processus long et fastidieux, mais très stimulant. Il m'arrive de le faire seul, mais cela me prend alors environ 6 heures (ce qui est rare).\n\nEnsuite, nous attribuons les rôles. Généralement, Shizuka finalise le script que nous avons esquissé au début. Elle consulte constamment divers tutoriels et recherche des références afin d'apporter une dimension nouvelle à la bande dessinée originale. Elle aime réinterpréter le sens de toute l'histoire, généralement avec humour.\n\nActuellement, je redessine la majeure partie de la BD, d'après le nouveau scénario, pour qu'elle ait finalement une signification complètement différente. Je consacre aussi beaucoup de temps à redessiner les vêtements des personnages et les décors. Pour dessiner, je dois regarder beaucoup de tutoriels sur différents sujets, car c'est une tâche assez complexe. Je regarde constamment des vidéos pédagogiques sur YouTube concernant le storyboard, le dessin des vêtements, l'anatomie humaine (et parfois animale) et la lumière, car les ombres améliorent le dessin. Il faut consulter de nombreuses références pour trouver des idées de vêtements, de décoration intérieure et pour bien gérer les ombres sous différents éclairages. J'ai toujours toutes les combinaisons de couleurs ouvertes sur mon deuxième écran. Pendant que Shizuka termine le scénario, je prépare une miniature pour la vidéo. À la fin, j'ajoute les dialogues du scénario de Shizuka. Cela nous prend généralement entre six et huit heures. Je ne sais pas combien de temps j'aurais pu y arriver seul sans l'aide de Shizuka (peut-être 16 heures ?).\n\nUne fois tout le travail accompli, nous avons commencé le doublage de la BD remaniée. Étant comédiens de doublage professionnels et ayant une longue expérience, nous avons fait peu d'erreurs. Lors du montage vidéo, il nous arrive souvent de devoir redoubler certaines répliques, notamment à cause d'erreurs d'intonation. Ensuite, j'ai monté la partie visuelle de la BD avec Sony Vegas Pro 11, tandis que Shizuka cherchait de la musique dans la bibliothèque YouTube et créait une piste audio avec Ableton Live 11. Après avoir assemblé nos efforts, nous avons lancé le rendu. À ce stade, nous avions déjà passé entre 13 et 15 heures dessus.\n\nEt voilà, vous avez pu visionner cette vidéo !\n\nMerci de nous soutenir, de liker et de vous abonner à la chaîne :)\n\nCette vidéo a été créée à des fins de divertissement et d'humour uniquement et n'a pas pour but d'offenser qui que ce soit !

Having painted a stampeding, spirited portrait of the American West with his sophomore album White Buffalo in 2023, Munsick is expanding on the concepts of the land, people, culture and stories that inspire him, on his most recent 20-track album, Eagle Feather, released on April 18, 2025. In addition to selling over 100,000 headlining tickets in 2024, Munsick also opened on select dates of Lainey Wilson’s Country’s Cool Again Tour and supported Morgan Wallen on select dates of his record-setting One Night At A Time Tour. Munsick concluded his spring Horses Are Faster Tour in Nashville. He has been named an “Artist to Watch” by Spotify, CMT, Fender, MusicRow and most recently was named a Martin Showcase Artist. Standout duet “Long Live Cowgirls” (with Cody Johnson) off of White Buffalo hit No. 1 on SiriusXM’s The Highway Hot 30 Countdown, was named one of Amazon Music’s Best Country Songs of 2022 and recently received RIAA Gold-certification alongside “Long Haul” and “Horses Are Faster.” Fans of Ian Munsick will always find an open heart, natural awe and plainspoken honesty as he rides on… bringing the West to the rest.

Having painted a stampeding, spirited portrait of the American West with his sophomore album White Buffalo in 2023, Munsick is expanding on the concepts of the land, people, culture and stories that inspire him, on his most recent 20-track album, Eagle Feather, released on April 18, 2025. In addition to selling over 100,000 headlining tickets in 2024, Munsick also opened on select dates of Lainey Wilson’s Country’s Cool Again Tour and supported Morgan Wallen on select dates of his record-setting One Night At A Time Tour. Munsick concluded his spring Horses Are Faster Tour in Nashville. He has been named an “Artist to Watch” by Spotify, CMT, Fender, MusicRow and most recently was named a Martin Showcase Artist. Standout duet “Long Live Cowgirls” (with Cody Johnson) off of White Buffalo hit No. 1 on SiriusXM’s The Highway Hot 30 Countdown, was named one of Amazon Music’s Best Country Songs of 2022 and recently received RIAA Gold-certification alongside “Long Haul” and “Horses Are Faster.” Fans of Ian Munsick will always find an open heart, natural awe and plainspoken honesty as he rides on… bringing the West to the rest.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms. #Roblox​​​ #Rektway​​​ #99nightintheforest",

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”).
