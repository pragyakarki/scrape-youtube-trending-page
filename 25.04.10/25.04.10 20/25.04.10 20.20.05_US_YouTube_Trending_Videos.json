Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, A Minecraft Movie, directed by Jared Hess, is the first ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival! Four misfits—Garrett \"The Garbage Man\" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.  \n\nConnect with A Minecraft Movie:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/AMinecraftMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@AMinecraftMovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AMinecraftMovie\nX: https://x.com/AMinecraftMovie\n\nConnect with WaterTower Music:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/watertowermusic\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@watertowermusic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/WaterTowerMusic\nX: https://x.com/watertowermusic\nOfficial site: https://www.watertower-music.com/\n\nAbout WaterTower Music:\nWaterTower Music, the in-house label for the WarnerMedia companies, releases recorded music as rich and diverse as the companies themselves.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson",

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson"

Sein Witz und sein trockener Humor sprechen Kinder und Erwachsene gleichermaßen an. Als Kind der Millennial-Generation verbindet sich seine Wertschätzung für neue Technologien mit seiner traditionellen Arbeitsmoral. Er verfügt über die einzigartige Fähigkeit, seine Botschaft so zu vermitteln, dass sie sowohl langjährige Landwirte als auch Menschen ohne landwirtschaftliche Kenntnisse anspricht. Angesichts des wachsenden Bewusstseins der Verbraucher für die Herkunft ihrer Lebensmittel hat Zach erkannt, dass eine unabhängige Stimme aus der Landwirtschaft benötigt wird. Zach fördert aktiv die Landwirtschaft, indem er seine täglichen Erfahrungen in der Landwirtschaft teilt und gleichzeitig Landwirte für Landwirte schult, um den Dialog zwischen Landwirten und der Öffentlichkeit zu fördern.\n\nFolgen Sie uns\n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/\n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial\n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nBearbeitet von: Becky Johnson"

Son esprit vif et son humour pince-sans-rire plaisent autant aux petits qu'aux grands. Issu de la génération Y, son goût pour les nouvelles technologies se marie à son éthique de travail traditionnelle. Il possède une capacité unique à transmettre son message d'une manière qui trouve un écho auprès des agriculteurs de longue date comme auprès de ceux qui n'ont aucune connaissance en agriculture. Face à la sensibilisation croissante des consommateurs à la provenance de leurs aliments, Zach a identifié le besoin d'une voix indépendante, issue des premières lignes de l'agriculture. Zach promeut activement l'agriculture en partageant son expérience quotidienne dans le monde agricole et en proposant des formations d'agriculteur à agriculteur afin de faciliter un dialogue collaboratif entre les agriculteurs et le public.\n\nSuivez-nous\n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nModifié par : Becky Johnson"

            "description": "Anamaria Sayre | April 7, 2025\nFor a moment, Bad Bunny forgot that he wasn’t in Puerto Rico. Despite its residence in a news building in the capital of the United States, the Tiny Desk can — when colored by the careful vision of a true artist — take you anywhere else, especially the true origins of the music. \n\nBut for the superstar, Puerto Rico is so beloved and so sacred that he could never truly forget it… and he’s making sure the world sees that, too. The island is his source of inspiration and the mandate for which he wages war. Flanked by cuatros and congas, Bad Bunny wields the power of Puerto Ricans who have strummed chords and hummed lelolai for generations in efforts to keep the culture alive. \n\nAfter performing “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii,” San Benito tells a parable about a man drawn to his band rehearsing outside the White House. “It’s incredible,” the man in the story says, “that after a hundred years of colonization you keep your culture, your language, your tongue, your slang.”\n\nThe Puerto Rican flag laid out before him shines; its brilliant blue is defiant and captivating. “They killed people for waving the flag,” Bad Bunny sings in “LA MuDANZA.” But there’s such joy in the expression and such vibrance in the dance. Even with his global platform, Benito’s true magic is intimacy: He wants you to fall in love with Puerto Rico. We scream with him: “Yo soy de P f****** R!” Whether you are you aren’t, your heart won’t know the difference.\n\nSET LIST\n“PIToRRO DE COCO”\n“VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR”\n“KLOuFRENS”\n“LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii”\n“LA MuDANZA”\n\nMUSICIANS\nBad Bunny: vocals\nLuis Sanz: cuatro puertorriqueño, tiple, bordonúa, background vocals\nFabiola Méndez: cuatro puertorriqueño, tiple, bordonúa, background vocals\nEmanuel Santana: güicharo, Pandero de plena, maracas, background vocals\nJulito Gastón: congas\nKrystal Santana: bass, background vocals\nLuis Amed Irizarry: piano\nJay Anthony: bongos, percussion\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Keren Carrión, Zayrha Rodriguez\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Virginia Lozano\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #badbunny",

This time their challenge was to prepare their own fine-dining versions of some traditional Korean dishes!\nBig thanks to Gillette for making this possible and sponsoring this episode.\n\nHead over to Jack and Will's channel for amazing culinary content -  ⁨@FallowLondon  \n\n저희 영국남자에 손흥민 선수님과 안성재 셰프님 모시게 된다는 소식을 듣고 아주 특별한 경험을 만들어 드리고 싶었는데요. 그래서 Fallow 셰프 잭과 윌에게 새로운 한식요리 챌리지를 부탁했습니다. 과연 영국 셰프들만의 전통한식 파인다이닝은 어떤 방식으로 재해석됐을까요? 이런 특별한 기회를 마련해주신 질레트에게 정말 감사합니다.\n\n맛있는 요리를 해주신 영국 셰프님들 보러 고고 -  ⁨@FallowLondon",

Pictures.  In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind.\n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with editors William Hoy (“The Batman”), Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Flash”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).\n\n“Superman” will be in theaters and IMAX nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.",

                "description": "Welcome back! Are you ready to start the show? #FNAF2Movie only in theaters this December.\n\n--- \nAnyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.\n\nBlumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, begins a blood-chilling new chapter of animatronic terror.\n\nBased on Scott Cawthon’s blockbuster game series, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi (The Wind, Blood Moon).\n\nThe first film, which opened to a record-shattering $80 million and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide, followed Mike, a troubled young man who reluctantly takes a job as a night security guard at an abandoned theme restaurant, Freddy\nFazbear’s Pizzeria, hoping it will help him retain custody of his young sister. That fateful decision instead drags him into the black heart of a supernatural nightmare. \n\nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is again produced by Jason Blum (M3GAN, Black Phone, Halloween franchise) and Scott Cawthon.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie\nfivenightsatfreddys.movie"

            "description": "oops! she did it again!\n#M3GAN2 is only in theaters June 27. \n\n---\nWebsite: http://www.M3GANmovie.com\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/universalpictures  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meetM3GAN/\nX: https://twitter.com/meetm3gan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/M3GAN/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/m3gan\n\n\nThe murderous doll who captivated pop culture in 2023 is back. And this time she’s not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon—led by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and writer-director Gerard Johnstone—reboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0. Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on\na murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently\ndestroyed, M3GAN’s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma’s niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma’s overprotective rules.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia’s self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. \n\nWith the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I icon is about to meet her match.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 is written and directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone, from a story by Gerard Johnstone and Akela Cooper, based on characters created by Akela Cooper & James Wan.\n\nThe film co-stars returning cast members Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps as Gemma’s loyal tech teammates, Cole and Tess, and new characters played by Aristotle Athari (Saturday Night Live, Hacks), Timm Sharp (Apples Never Fall, Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement (Avatar: The Way of Water, What We Do in the Shadows). \n\nProduced by James Wan, Jason Blum and Allison Williams, the film is executive produced by Gerard Johnstone, Adam Hendricks, Greg Gilreath, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Mark D. Katchur. \n\nThe first M3GAN film shattered box office records, opening to $30.4 million domestically to become the biggest opening weekend for a PG-13 horror film since A Quiet Place Part II. The film went on to gross more than $180 million worldwide.",

                "description": "oops! she did it again!\n#M3GAN2 is only in theaters June 27. \n\n---\nWebsite: http://www.M3GANmovie.com\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/universalpictures  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meetM3GAN/\nX: https://twitter.com/meetm3gan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/M3GAN/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/m3gan\n\n\nThe murderous doll who captivated pop culture in 2023 is back. And this time she’s not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon—led by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and writer-director Gerard Johnstone—reboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0. Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on\na murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently\ndestroyed, M3GAN’s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma’s niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma’s overprotective rules.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia’s self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. \n\nWith the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I icon is about to meet her match.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 is written and directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone, from a story by Gerard Johnstone and Akela Cooper, based on characters created by Akela Cooper & James Wan.\n\nThe film co-stars returning cast members Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps as Gemma’s loyal tech teammates, Cole and Tess, and new characters played by Aristotle Athari (Saturday Night Live, Hacks), Timm Sharp (Apples Never Fall, Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement (Avatar: The Way of Water, What We Do in the Shadows). \n\nProduced by James Wan, Jason Blum and Allison Williams, the film is executive produced by Gerard Johnstone, Adam Hendricks, Greg Gilreath, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Mark D. Katchur. \n\nThe first M3GAN film shattered box office records, opening to $30.4 million domestically to become the biggest opening weekend for a PG-13 horror film since A Quiet Place Part II. The film went on to gross more than $180 million worldwide."

            "description": "We’re not sure how... but Kylie is SOMEHOW BACK for a brand new episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Nanit just days after giving birth to her and Jason’s fourth baby girl, Finnley Anne Kelce.\n\nKylie starts things off by explaining why it was so important to her to record a Postpartum Special immediately after having her baby and introduces Baby Finn to the Real Ones for the first time. She also concludes the baby name search saga and explains how they ultimately decided on Finn’s first and middle names.\n\nThen, in a postpartum edition of “Can I Be Honest?” Kylie details her birth story, sharing everything from her labor experience, to that “fat needle in her back” to Jason’s all-pro level skills as a support person and cord cutter. \n\nAfter that, even on very minimal sleep, Kylie brings some fire to a fan favorite segment, except this time it’s the sequel: The Dos & Don’ts of Talking to Postpartum Women. Kylie highlights the things she least appreciates hearing like “sleep while the baby is sleeping” and also shares some advice on what can be helpful to new moms.\n\nAlso, in honor of her fourth baby girl, Kylie answers 4ish questions about the first couple days of being a family of six, including how the first meeting went for all four Kelce sisters and who Finn looks like the most.\n\nThen, Kylie brings back one of her personal favorite segments “You Know What’s F*cked Up?” to touch on the subject of “newborn bliss.” Kylie opens up about her past experiences with postpartum anxiety with the help of a special guest – acclaimed author, therapist and advocate for maternal mental health – Rebecca Fox Starr.\n\nKylie asks Rebecca about the signs women and their families can look out for when it comes to postpartum depression, what needs to be fixed with the current screening system used by most hospitals, who to contact for help and the common misconceptions about “baby blues.” \n\nMake sure you tune into More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for more exclusive clips!

                "description": "We’re not sure how... but Kylie is SOMEHOW BACK for a brand new episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Nanit just days after giving birth to her and Jason’s fourth baby girl, Finnley Anne Kelce.\n\nKylie starts things off by explaining why it was so important to her to record a Postpartum Special immediately after having her baby and introduces Baby Finn to the Real Ones for the first time. She also concludes the baby name search saga and explains how they ultimately decided on Finn’s first and middle names.\n\nThen, in a postpartum edition of “Can I Be Honest?” Kylie details her birth story, sharing everything from her labor experience, to that “fat needle in her back” to Jason’s all-pro level skills as a support person and cord cutter. \n\nAfter that, even on very minimal sleep, Kylie brings some fire to a fan favorite segment, except this time it’s the sequel: The Dos & Don’ts of Talking to Postpartum Women. Kylie highlights the things she least appreciates hearing like “sleep while the baby is sleeping” and also shares some advice on what can be helpful to new moms.\n\nAlso, in honor of her fourth baby girl, Kylie answers 4ish questions about the first couple days of being a family of six, including how the first meeting went for all four Kelce sisters and who Finn looks like the most.\n\nThen, Kylie brings back one of her personal favorite segments “You Know What’s F*cked Up?” to touch on the subject of “newborn bliss.” Kylie opens up about her past experiences with postpartum anxiety with the help of a special guest – acclaimed author, therapist and advocate for maternal mental health – Rebecca Fox Starr.\n\nKylie asks Rebecca about the signs women and their families can look out for when it comes to postpartum depression, what needs to be fixed with the current screening system used by most hospitals, who to contact for help and the common misconceptions about “baby blues.” \n\nMake sure you tune into More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for more exclusive clips! We’ll be back next Thursday with a brand new episode.\n.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/not-gonna-lie-with-kylie-kelce/id1780888125\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0RgXbSGGmwpzAyeLHbDqUD?si=4585dab89c4f4c11&nd=1&dlsi=e178bf324b99403f\n\nFollow Not Gonna Lie on Social Media for all the best moments from the show: \nlnk.to/j61XD8\n\nSupport the Show:  \n\nNanit: Go to Nanit.com for 20% off your first purchase with code KYLIE20\n(Code is only valid for purchases on Nanit.com)\n\nLovevery: NGL listeners can get an exclusive discount on their first subscription order by entering code KYLIE at checkout at https://lovevery.com/\n\nResources on Postpartum Depression:\nhttps://postpartum.net/\n\nRebecca Fox Starr’s new book: Am I Doing This Right?\nhttps://a.co/d/eaVtqAq  \n\nMore About Rebecca!

Major components of the car are from Mexico, Canada and South Korea, which could all be a part of the auto tariffs.\n\nWSJ takes a look inside a Ford F-150 to better understand Trump’s slew of new tariffs and why automakers are warning it could backfire. \n\nChapters:\n0:00 Trump’s auto tariffs\n0:53 Tariff breakdown of car parts\n4:12 Challenge of opening new plants\n5:32 Economic impact and broader threats\n\nNews Explainers\nSome days the high-speed news cycle can bring more questions than answers. WSJ’s news explainers break down the day's biggest stories into bite-size pieces to help you make sense of the news.\n\n#Trump #Cars #WSJ"

With the lowest fertility rate ever recorded and a rapidly aging population, the country faces a future of economic decline, shrinking cities, cultural erosion, and a vanishing workforce. \nBy 2060, nearly half of South Koreans could be over the age of 65, and entire regions may be abandoned as the population continues to shrink.\nHow did South Korea reach this point? Why might it no longer be possible to reverse the trend? And what does this mean for other countries on a similar path?\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤️ https://shop.kgs.link\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of kurzgesagt soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe soundtrack of this video:\nSoundCloud: https://bit.ly/3E02bka\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/4cfFBRt\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nThomas Heffernan, Lily, Allan Curtis, Gick, Patrick Bonner, Mee Chan, Benno, Inma Reis, Erin McKeehan, Danielle Ritchie, Fernando Gámez Losada, Krunk, Owen Smith, Alex Bouez, David McCormack, Kévain G., BrentD, Katie Garber, Kevin Aluwi, icyberg, Boris, Cobaltergeist, Matzuta, Jaken8tor, Tina Martinez, TheNocturnist, Arjun Singh, Sidney Story, ManlioRN, TNT TV Gaming, OffBeatBunny, Haezan, Marcin Gajda, Jindřich Vlášek",

            "description": "It’s new machine day in the workshop, and we’re taking things to the next level—literally! We’re upgrading to a 6.3-tonne overhead gantry crane with a 17.7-metre span, and this beast is going to change how we move heavy equipment, making our workflow more efficient and lifting jobs safer. Thanks to the crew from Austwide Cranes that allowed us to capture every step of the action on this 3 day installation!\n\n🔥 Day 1 – Foundations & Structural Setup\nThe Austwide Cranes team arrived early to precisely mark out where everything needed to go using lasers and measuring equipment. They then drilled and installed jacking bolts to secure the crane columns. Then, the steel structure arrived, and things got interesting. With limited access around our big machines, positioning the columns wasn’t straightforward. The team used a forklift with a jib attachment to manoeuvre them into place. For the two most difficult columns, Kurtis jumped in with the yard crane to install them himself. With those locked down, we moved on to lifting and securing the 12-metre-long runway beams—a huge step forward in the build.\n\n⚡ Day 2 – Securing, Power, & Final Adjustments\nNow that the structure was in place, the team focused on securing and levelling everything. They welded end stop mounts to the runway beams and installed the busbar system, which supplies power to the crane along the runway. Then the electrician started running the main power connections, getting everything prepped for the final stage of the installation.\n\n🚀 Day 3 – The Crane Arrives & Final Installation!\nThe moment we’d been waiting for—the main crane unit arrived, and it was an absolute weapon! Painted in the workshop blue with our logo, it looked f*cken awesome. To do the lift was the crew from Mighty Cranes, who used their AT-20 Terex Franna to handle the job. The install happened in just minutes with the guidance of the Austwide Cranes techs, and before we knew it, the crane was sitting perfectly on the runway structure. But the job wasn’t over yet. The electrician still had to wire up the main power connections and complete the final testing and end limit settings to ensure everything operated safely.\n\nWith the installation done, we finally get to test out our new workshop crane—and what better way than by lifting one of our lathes? This is a game-changer for our workshop, and we’re pumped to see how much easier our heavy lifting jobs will be from now on. What do you think of our new setup? Let us know in the comments! 👇\n\nA big shout out and special THANKS to Austwide Cranes for all their support with installation and for allowing us to video the process! https://www.austwidecranes.com.au/\n\nThanks also to Mighty Cranes for the lift assist: https://mightycranes.com.au/\n\nJoin our channel:\nWe upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
