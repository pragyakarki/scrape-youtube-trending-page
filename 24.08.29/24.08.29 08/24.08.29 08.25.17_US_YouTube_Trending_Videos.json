mind\nWell I saw him walk in\nWith his cowboy hat\nAnd I thought to myself\nI could use some of that\nHis boots like glass on a saw dust floor\nHad moves like nothin’ I’d ever seen before\nSo I walked right up\nI pulled him to the side\nI handed him a beer and looked him right in the eye\nAnd I said “Baby, I think you’re gonna wanna hear this”\nI said\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n\nWell I was down at the local beer joint with a few of the guys \nWhen this cute little country girl caught my eye \nAnd boy let me tell you she was the prettiest thing i’d ever seen in a pair of boots\nWell she walked right up to me, handed me a beer \nGave me a look like, lets get outta here \nAnd that's when I realized that she was every cowboys dream come true \nShe told me this right here, she said..\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nSo if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat\n\nAnd you think to yourself\nI could use some of that\nDon’t waste your time\nJust give ‘em this here line\nGoes a little like this\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n  \n#EllaLangley #RileyGreen #youlooklikeyouloveme",

look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n\nWell I was down at the local beer joint with a few of the guys \nWhen this cute little country girl caught my eye \nAnd boy let me tell you she was the prettiest thing i’d ever seen in a pair of boots\nWell she walked right up to me, handed me a beer \nGave me a look like, lets get outta here \nAnd that's when I realized that she was every cowboys dream come true \nShe told me this right here, she said..\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nSo if you ever see a man in a cowboy hat\n\nAnd you think to yourself\nI could use some of that\nDon’t waste your time\nJust give ‘em this here line\nGoes a little like this\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n  \n#EllaLangley #RileyGreen #youlooklikeyouloveme"

Oscar-nominated, singular creative visionary Tim Burton and Oscar nominee and star Michael Keaton reunite for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the long-awaited sequel to Burton’s award-winning Beetlejuice.  \n\nKeaton returns to his iconic role alongside Oscar nominee Winona Ryder (Stranger Things, Little Women) as Lydia Deetz and two-time Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara (Schitt$ Creek, The Nightmare Before Christmas) as Delia Deetz, with new cast members Justin Theroux (Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi, The Leftovers), Monica Bellucci (Spectre, The Matrix films), Arthur Conti (House of the Dragon) in his feature film debut, with Emmy nominee Jenna Ortega (Wednesday, Scream VI) as Lydia’s daughter, Astrid, and Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (Poor Things, At Eternity’s Gate).\n\nBeetlejuice is back!  After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River.  Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened.  With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice's name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.\n\nBurton, a genre unto himself, directs from a screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (Wednesday), story by Gough & Millar and Seth Grahame-Smith (The LEGO® Batman Movie), based on characters created by Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson.  The film’s producers are Marc Toberoff, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Tommy Harper and Burton, with Sara Desmond, Katterli Frauenfelder, Gough, Millar, Brad Pitt, Larry Wilson, Laurence Senelick, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary, Anthony Tittanegro, Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg executive producing.\n\nBurton’s creatives behind the scenes includes director of photography Haris Zambarloukos (Meg 2: The Trench, Murder on the Orient Express); such previous and frequent collaborators as production designer Mark Scruton (Wednesday), editor Jay Prychidny (Wednesday), Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (Alice in Wonderland, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Sleepy Hollow), Oscar-winning creature effects and special makeup FX creative supervisor Neal Scanlan (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and Oscar-nominated composer Danny Elfman (Big Fish, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman); and Oscar-winning hair and makeup designer Christine Blundell (Topsy-Turvy).\n\nA Warner Bros. Pictures presentation, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice will be released only in theaters and IMAX on September 6, 2024 nationwide, and internationally beginning 4 September 2024.

Когда мы только начинали работу над этим мультсериалом, нас было всего 20 сотрудников, и мы переживали одну из крупнейших пандемий в истории! Теперь нас уже 50 человек в команде и за год мы вложили в этот эпизод всю нашу любовь и усердную работу! И надеемся что наши старания заметны!!!!\n\nЕсли вам понравилось шоу, пожалуйста, подумайте о том, чтобы поддержать нас покупкой нового мерча по Murder Drones {LINK} — все вырученные средства пойдут на финансирование художников, персонала и следующего шоу!\n\nНаконец, мы хотели бы сказать, что, хотя на этом серия \"Дронов-убийц\" заканчивается, но, возможно, мы захотим сделать больше контента с \"Узи\" и \"N\".... кто знает?! Мы можем делать все, что захотим в независимой анимации! \nСПАСИБО, ЧТО СМОТРЕЛИ НАС ВСЁ ЭТО ВРЕМЯ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !❤❤❤❤❤❤❤\n\nОзвучено NDRecrods Продакшен по заказу GLITCH в 2024 году \n \nРоли Дублировали: \nАрина Колотюк - Узи \nМакс Манн - N \nСветлана Аманова - V\nАнастасия Сидорова - Син, J\nЕлена Ефремова - Нори \nВячеслав Никитин - Хан \nГерман Каз - Тэд\nКатя Гершкович - Лиззи \n\nРежиссер: Иван Шухин \nДиректор по локализации и Со-режиссер: Никита Мауров \n \nЗвукорежиссер: \nИван Шухин \n \nПеревод: \nУльяна (martrikken) Мартюкова \n \nРедактор текста: \nИван Шухин \n \nОзвучено NDRecrods Production \nГруппа ВК: https://vk.com/by_ndr \nTelegram: https://t.me/TheGeekProduction \nСайт: \nhttps://ndrprod.com/"

            "description": "This Maasai Mara Conservancy program, led by the Maasai people, has proven to be extremely successful. It provides an economic model that not only preserves the land, animals, and the Maasai way of life, but also offers the potential to significantly expand the protected areas. In total there are 24 conservancies that now work together under the Maasai Mara Conservancy. Only 7 had access to the tools and technology needed to track environmental conditions and generate carbon credits that can be sold to continue and expand  this incredible program. We paid for an additional 7 power and weather stations, and committed to pay for 5 more, bringing the total to 19. Let's band together and raise the money to pay for the last five remaining conservancies together. We’re so close to getting something so important complete. Please click the Donate button, or visit this link to help save these animals, this land, and the Maasai people who live in harmony with the earth.\n\nhttps://www.beastphilanthropy.org/campaign/savingendangeredanimals-kenya\n\nThis is our 6th project with GivePower (​​https://givepower.org/) and we have many more already underway.

                "description": "This Maasai Mara Conservancy program, led by the Maasai people, has proven to be extremely successful. It provides an economic model that not only preserves the land, animals, and the Maasai way of life, but also offers the potential to significantly expand the protected areas. In total there are 24 conservancies that now work together under the Maasai Mara Conservancy. Only 7 had access to the tools and technology needed to track environmental conditions and generate carbon credits that can be sold to continue and expand  this incredible program. We paid for an additional 7 power and weather stations, and committed to pay for 5 more, bringing the total to 19. Let's band together and raise the money to pay for the last five remaining conservancies together. We’re so close to getting something so important complete. Please click the Donate button, or visit this link to help save these animals, this land, and the Maasai people who live in harmony with the earth.\n\nhttps://www.beastphilanthropy.org/campaign/savingendangeredanimals-kenya\n\nThis is our 6th project with GivePower (​​https://givepower.org/) and we have many more already underway.  We seriously love these people. GivePower delivers solar powered solutions to developing regions across the planet.  Show them lots of love for the incredible work they do across the planet.\n\n\nFilmed and Edited by: Dan Mace ( https://www.youtube.com/@DanMace)\n\nFollow us to help us help more:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/beastphilanthropy/ \nWebsite: https://www.beastphilanthropy.org/donate/ \nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@beastphilanthropy\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BeastPhilanthr \nFacebook: ​​https://www.facebook.com/Beast-Philanthropy-112268218256173 \n\nBeast Philanthropy Video Disclaimer: This video was produced by Beast Philanthropy Productions, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 Turkish Business Class😍\n01:10 book with miles and points!✈️\n02:20 3 hours Amsterdam to Istanbul\n04:22 Secret hotel in Turkish lounge!👀\n11:47 11 hours IST to ORD🙌🏼\n13:53 my “critical” flight review ;)\n16:22 amenity kits\n18:55 meal #1 breakfast\n22:10 meal #2 dinner\n25:42 bathroom tour\n26:20 seat tour\n29:29 bloops",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 Turkish Business Class😍\n01:10 book with miles and points!✈️\n02:20 3 hours Amsterdam to Istanbul\n04:22 Secret hotel in Turkish lounge!👀\n11:47 11 hours IST to ORD🙌🏼\n13:53 my “critical” flight review ;)\n16:22 amenity kits\n18:55 meal #1 breakfast\n22:10 meal #2 dinner\n25:42 bathroom tour\n26:20 seat tour\n29:29 bloops"

            "description": "Mitra I. Arthur | August 23, 2024\nHave you ever been in a room where you can feel a palpable, collective swooning? Welcome to a Maxwell Tiny Desk. The crooner’s sensual falsetto and rooted baritone have seduced audiences since his debut album dropped in 1996. One of the leading voices in the resurgence of soul music during the late ’90s, Maxwell’s albums are full of tender songs recounting love, life and heartbreak that have resonated with generations of fans looking for ways to be vulnerable.\n\nClad in soothing neutrals, Maxwell charmingly admitted his nervousness at being at the Desk, stating that “This is where real music can’t lie. You cannot lie here.” The audience was there with encouragement — singing along, screaming in pure glee and adding the party vibe when needed. His set here featured “Sumthin' Sumthin'” complete with a funky bass solo from Darrell \"Free\" Freeman. “Lifetime” features impressive work from Travis Sayles on the keys and Shedrick “Shed” Mitchell on the Hammond B3 organ, an instrument I’m admittedly partial to. Maxwell presented his latest single during this set, a cover of the Al Green classic “Simply Beautiful,” breathing life into the song and paying homage to the soul singer. To end his set, Maxwell performed the song that launched his career, “Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder).” Percussionist Charles Haynes gave us a little D.C. go-go flavor as everyone partied.\n\nSET LIST\n“Sumthin' Sumthin'”\n“Bad Habits”\n“Lifetime”\n“Pretty Wings”\n“Simply Beautiful”\n“Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder)”\n\nMUSICIANS\nMaxwell: lead vocals \nShedrick \"Shed\" Mitchell: keys, musical director \nHod David: guitar \nTravis Sayles: keys \nDarryl \"Lil Man\" Howell: drums \nDarrell \"Free\" Freeman: bass \nLaTina Webb: vocals \nAaron Marcellus: vocals \nCharles Haynes: percussion\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josephine Nyounai\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Zayrha Rodriguez\nAudio Engineer: Ted Mebane\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Team: Kara Frame, Ashley Pointer, Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #maxwell",

                "description": "Michelle Obama is standing up for Gus Walz after his viral support for dad Tim Walz at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. Gus made headlines for his heartwarming show of emotion as the vice presidential candidate delivered his speech at the Chicago event, appearing to mouth \"that's my dad!\" while standing up to cheer Tim on through tears. Though many found Gus' reaction moving, others poking fun at the teen prompted swift backlash on social media as the former First Lady also spoke out. \"I was touched to see Gus Walz’s joy when his dad Tim Walz took the stage last night,\" Michelle wrote on Instagram, captioning a photo of Gus and Tim hugging. \"Thankful for you showing us all what real love looks like, Gus. Let’s be a nation that embraces this kind of warmth and vulnerability, instead of making fun or mocking it. We could all use some of Gus’s example in our own lives.\"\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiKGMZZmZXK-RpbKJGXgH3Q?sub_confirmation=1\n» Visit Our Website: http://accessonline.com\n\nGet More Access :\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/accesshollywood/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/accesshollywood\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/accesshollywood/\n\n#AccessHollywood #MichelleObama\n\n\"Access Hollywood\" is an entertainment news show featuring Mario Lopez, Kit Hoover, Scott Evans, and correspondent Zuri Hall.

            "description": "Peter Jackson presents a groundbreaking journey back to Middle-earth through the eyes of legendary director Kenji Kamiyama.\n#LOTR The War of the Rohirrim - only in theaters Christmas.\n\nNew Line Cinema’s original anime feature “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” returns audiences to the epic world brought to life in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, based on the revered books by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nUnder the direction of award-winning filmmaker Kenji Kamiyama (the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” and “Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex” TV series), the talented voice cast is led by Brian Cox (“Succession”) as Helm Hammerhand, the mighty King of Rohan; Gaia Wise (“A Walk in the Woods”) as his daughter Héra; and Luke Pasqualino (“Snowpiercer”) as Wulf. Miranda Otto, who delivered an unforgettable, award-winning performance in “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, reprises her role as Éowyn, Shieldmaiden of Rohan, who serves as the tale’s narrator. The voice ensemble also includes Lorraine Ashbourne (Netflix’s “Bridgerton”), Yazdan Qafouri (“I Came By”), Benjamin Wainwright (“World on Fire”), Laurence Ubong Williams (“Gateway”), Shaun Dooley (“The Witcher”), Michael Wildman (“Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw”), Jude Akuwudike (“Beasts of No Nation”), Bilal Hasna (“Sparks”) and Janine Duvitski (“Benidorm”).\n\nSet 183 years before the events chronicled in the original trilogy of films, “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” tells the fate of the House of Helm Hammerhand, the legendary King of Rohan. A sudden attack by Wulf, a clever and ruthless Dunlending lord seeking vengeance for the death of his father, forces Helm and his people to make a daring last stand in the ancient stronghold of the Hornburg— a mighty fortress that will later come to be known as Helm’s Deep. Finding herself in an increasingly desperate situation, Héra, the daughter of Helm, must summon the will to lead the resistance against a deadly enemy intent on their total destruction.\n\nWith Kamiyama at the helm, the original feature is being produced by Oscar winner Philippa Boyens, from the screenwriting team behind “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” Trilogies, alongside Jason DeMarco and Joseph Chou, who, in addition to their many separate animation projects, collaborated on the “Blade Runner: Black Lotus” series. The executive producers are Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson, Sam Register, Carolyn Blackwood and Toby Emmerich. The screenplay is by Jeffrey Addiss & Will Matthews and Phoebe Gittins & Arty Papageorgiou, story by Addiss & Matthews and Boyens, based on characters created by J.R.R. Tolkien. The team of creative collaborators returning from “The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy also includes Oscar winners Alan Lee and Richard Taylor, along with esteemed Tolkien illustrator John Howe.\n\nA New Line Cinema Presentation, a Warner Bros. Animation / Sola Entertainment Production, “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” will be distributed theatrically worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, released in cinemas nationwide on December 13, 2024, and internationally beginning 11 December 2024.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",
