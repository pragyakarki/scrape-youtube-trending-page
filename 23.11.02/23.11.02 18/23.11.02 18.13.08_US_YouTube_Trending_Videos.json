            "description": "Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Oliver Murray \nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton \nOriginal score: Paul Englishby \nSound Designer: Alastair Sirkett \nAudio Restoration: Park Road Post Production\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists \nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup \nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   \n\nStream The Beatles: \n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic \n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify \n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic \n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora \n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal \n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer \n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   \n\nFollow The Beatles:  \n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com \n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr",

                "description": "HELLO FRIENDS!! Yes, we did something bad. Now, as you guys may know... I love halloween. From the spooky decorations to the costumes, to the candy, oh yes, THE CANDY. From Snickers to Skittles to every Reese's shape imaginable, I am a halloween candy fiend. \n\nSo I had a horrible idea that I decided to act upon: what if we tried to melt every halloween candy together into a single franken-candy... the one candy to rule them all, and in the darkness, satiate my desire for an entire bucket of halloween candy in just one bite? \n\nWell, I guess we're gonna find out. Because that's what this video is about. \n\nBig thank you to Mat & StephPat from the Theorists, as well as Danielle & Karla from Escazù for being the guest tasters of our franken-candy bar!!

With a retail cost of over $8000, in my review I’ll show you exactly what the experience is like. From the lounge offered at the airport, to the onboard experience including the bed, food service and what exactly is upstairs on the Boeing 747? This is an ultra long haul flight, and is actually the world's longest 747 flight at over 15 hours in the sky! As usual I paid in full myself for this flight, full costings are shown in the video. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:55 - First Class Lounge\n6:31 - 747 Tour\n10:33 - The Bed\n13:33 - The Cost",

            "description": "Jaimie and Jay turn an animatronic into SPRINGTRAP from FNAF!\n\nCheck out these Govee Outdoor Lights! Amazon: https://bit.ly/3tpe79y Official: https://bit.ly/45YVI13\n\nSUBSCRIBE ► http://bit.ly/2EypcHI \n\nWicked Makers T-Shirts & Merch! ►\nhttps://shopwickedmakers.com\n\nGet Various Project Plans, Sneak Peaks, and more on our Patreon! ►\nhttps://patreon.com/wickedmakers\n\nJoin our community on Facebook & Discord! ►\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/439135431429446\nhttps://discord.gg/wickedmakers\n\nHalloween 2023 is almost here, and the Five NIghts at Freddy's movie is now out, so we decided to combine two of our favorite things and create our first custom full-sized FNAF animatronic - Springtrap.\n\nThe base animatronic we used for Springtrap was a Target animatronic skeleton - so technically this is an animatronic makeover. Not only does the skeleton animatronic have awesome movement, but Spring trap actually has a human body trapped inside of him, so it really fits the character. His suit parts are a mixture of EVA foam and 3D printed parts, all covered in green fleece and painted to look old and decayed.\n\nThis ended up being a huge DIY project for us, and we ran into a bunch of speed bumps along the way. We really hope you enjoyed seeing Springtrap in real life. Let us know what characters you want to see next!\n\nIf you love Halloween DIY projects, FNAF, and indie horror games and want to see more of our DIY Halloween props, check out our Dancing Withered Freddy and Huggy Wuggy animatronic.

Not only does the skeleton animatronic have awesome movement, but Spring trap actually has a human body trapped inside of him, so it really fits the character. His suit parts are a mixture of EVA foam and 3D printed parts, all covered in green fleece and painted to look old and decayed.\n\nThis ended up being a huge DIY project for us, and we ran into a bunch of speed bumps along the way. We really hope you enjoyed seeing Springtrap in real life. Let us know what characters you want to see next!\n\nIf you love Halloween DIY projects, FNAF, and indie horror games and want to see more of our DIY Halloween props, check out our Dancing Withered Freddy and Huggy Wuggy animatronic.

            "description": "Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. \n\nAs a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history. \n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT \nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n \nVideo Director: Oliver Murray\nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton\nOriginal score: Paul Englishby\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists\nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup\nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter\n\nStream The Beatles:\n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Appl...\n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify\n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Amaz...\n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora\n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal\n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer\n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouT...\n \nFollow The Beatles:\n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com\n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr",

He has spent much of this time\nin a state of denial, but now, Kanan’s blinders are finally off, and he doesn’t like what he\nsees. In season three, Kanan finds himself grappling with the very notions of right and\nwrong. Good and evil. Fidelity and disloyalty. And he’s not alone.
