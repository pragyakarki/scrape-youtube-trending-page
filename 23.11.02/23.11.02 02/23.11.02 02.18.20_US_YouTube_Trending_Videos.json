            "description": "Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Oliver Murray \nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton \nOriginal score: Paul Englishby \nSound Designer: Alastair Sirkett \nAudio Restoration: Park Road Post Production\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists \nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup \nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   \n\nStream The Beatles: \n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic \n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify \n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic \n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora \n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal \n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer \n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   \n\nFollow The Beatles:  \n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com \n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/qJHZu5",

As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Oliver Murray \nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton \nOriginal score: Paul Englishby \nSound Designer: Alastair Sirkett \nAudio Restoration: Park Road Post Production\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists \nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup \nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   \n\nStream The Beatles: \n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic \n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify \n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic \n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora \n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal \n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer \n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   \n\nFollow The Beatles:  \n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com \n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/qJHZu5"

With a retail cost of over $8000, in my review I’ll show you exactly what the experience is like. From the lounge offered at the airport, to the onboard experience including the bed, food service and what exactly is upstairs on the Boeing 747? This is an ultra long haul flight, and is actually the world's longest 747 flight at over 15 hours in the sky! As usual I paid in full myself for this flight, full costings are shown in the video. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:55 - First Class Lounge\n6:31 - 747 Tour\n10:33 - The Bed\n13:33 - The Cost",

            "description": "[LYRICS BELOW] \"To Be a Man\" is making an IMPACT. I truly believe there are millions more to touch with this song. I travelled to Nashville to complete this and had the pleasure of working with the legend Darius Rucker. I'm still in shock. Share this with everyone and anyone and let's make an impact with music FOR THE PEOPLE spread BY THE PEOPLE. Somebody out there needs this. Love y'all...Thank you. \n\nClick here to listen:\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/tbam\n\n\nFollow DAX: @thatsdax\nDirected by: Logan Meis \nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#ToBeAMan #Dax #Dariusrucker #masculinity #manhood #manosphere #masculine #men #traditionalman #remix \n\n\nLyrics:\n\nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road, and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not about how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nBeing a man is what you make it\nyou can’t always live up to expectations\nYou try to please everybody while you struggle so you fake it and end up out of balance compromising situations \nAs a good man\nA do what he should man\nA give everything he has and do everything he could man\nYou might find yourself feeling all alone\nInside a house you built that you don’t recognize as home\nAnd that’s what my daddy told me\nAnd i’ll tell my son the same\nNow that I’m older I relate and I actually feel his pain\nHe never cried\nHe might of lied but he did not complain \nAnd he said son one day you’ll have to do the same\nI get emotional when I stop I think and I look around\nbeyond the county lines of my small town\nI think about all the men out there who feel like I do now \nWho are screaming on the inside but won’t ever make a sound\n \nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not bout how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nDon’t give up, keep fightin’\nAs a man our son(sun) is our horizon\nAnd our father’s actions play a role\nAnd we end up like ‘em\nSo they can’t let us see them hurt\n‘Cause we’ll embody what they do\nAnd start a generational curse\n No wonder most men are so depressed\nAll the things that they can’t express\nThey go to war \nget thrown on the shelf\nThen go back to war with their mental health\nThen grab that bottle and ask for help\nTry to pull themselves out of h*ll\nThen fall back down and then realize that they gon’ have to do it themselves\n \nIt’s the circle of life\nAs a man you provide\nThey don’t know what you’re worth ‘til the day that you die\nAnd that’s when they start cryin’\nThen move on to a man to confide in\n \nThat’s why we feel\nWe can’t hide ourselves\nWe don’t expect you to understand\nWe just hope we can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and you don’t care about what we know\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n \nThat home\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. This is the most excited I've ever felt about a collab. It was absolutely legendary to work with Darius Rucker.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread and create healthy conversation. 2023 IS NOT OVER!! SO MUCH MORE ON THE WAY!!! I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout life. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world. Much love! This is MUSIC FOR THE PEOPLE!!!",

                "description": "[LYRICS BELOW] \"To Be a Man\" is making an IMPACT. I truly believe there are millions more to touch with this song. I travelled to Nashville to complete this and had the pleasure of working with the legend Darius Rucker. I'm still in shock. Share this with everyone and anyone and let's make an impact with music FOR THE PEOPLE spread BY THE PEOPLE. Somebody out there needs this. Love y'all...Thank you. \n\nClick here to listen:\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/tbam\n\n\nFollow DAX: @thatsdax\nDirected by: Logan Meis \nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#ToBeAMan #Dax #Dariusrucker #masculinity #manhood #manosphere #masculine #men #traditionalman #remix \n\n\nLyrics:\n\nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road, and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not about how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nBeing a man is what you make it\nyou can’t always live up to expectations\nYou try to please everybody while you struggle so you fake it and end up out of balance compromising situations \nAs a good man\nA do what he should man\nA give everything he has and do everything he could man\nYou might find yourself feeling all alone\nInside a house you built that you don’t recognize as home\nAnd that’s what my daddy told me\nAnd i’ll tell my son the same\nNow that I’m older I relate and I actually feel his pain\nHe never cried\nHe might of lied but he did not complain \nAnd he said son one day you’ll have to do the same\nI get emotional when I stop I think and I look around\nbeyond the county lines of my small town\nI think about all the men out there who feel like I do now \nWho are screaming on the inside but won’t ever make a sound\n \nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not bout how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nDon’t give up, keep fightin’\nAs a man our son(sun) is our horizon\nAnd our father’s actions play a role\nAnd we end up like ‘em\nSo they can’t let us see them hurt\n‘Cause we’ll embody what they do\nAnd start a generational curse\n No wonder most men are so depressed\nAll the things that they can’t express\nThey go to war \nget thrown on the shelf\nThen go back to war with their mental health\nThen grab that bottle and ask for help\nTry to pull themselves out of h*ll\nThen fall back down and then realize that they gon’ have to do it themselves\n \nIt’s the circle of life\nAs a man you provide\nThey don’t know what you’re worth ‘til the day that you die\nAnd that’s when they start cryin’\nThen move on to a man to confide in\n \nThat’s why we feel\nWe can’t hide ourselves\nWe don’t expect you to understand\nWe just hope we can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and you don’t care about what we know\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n \nThat home\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. This is the most excited I've ever felt about a collab. It was absolutely legendary to work with Darius Rucker.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread and create healthy conversation. 2023 IS NOT OVER!! SO MUCH MORE ON THE WAY!!! I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout life. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world. Much love! This is MUSIC FOR THE PEOPLE!!!"

            "description": "Jaimie and Jay turn an animatronic into SPRINGTRAP from FNAF!\n\nCheck out these Govee Outdoor Lights! Amazon: https://bit.ly/3tpe79y Official: https://bit.ly/45YVI13\n\nSUBSCRIBE ► http://bit.ly/2EypcHI \n\nWicked Makers T-Shirts & Merch! ►\nhttps://shopwickedmakers.com\n\nGet Various Project Plans, Sneak Peaks, and more on our Patreon! ►\nhttps://patreon.com/wickedmakers\n\nJoin our community on Facebook & Discord! ►\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/439135431429446\nhttps://discord.gg/wickedmakers\n\nHalloween 2023 is almost here, and the Five NIghts at Freddy's movie is now out, so we decided to combine two of our favorite things and create our first custom full-sized FNAF animatronic - Springtrap.\n\nThe base animatronic we used for Springtrap was a Target animatronic skeleton - so technically this is an animatronic makeover. Not only does the skeleton animatronic have awesome movement, but Spring trap actually has a human body trapped inside of him, so it really fits the character. His suit parts are a mixture of EVA foam and 3D printed parts, all covered in green fleece and painted to look old and decayed.\n\nThis ended up being a huge DIY project for us, and we ran into a bunch of speed bumps along the way. We really hope you enjoyed seeing Springtrap in real life. Let us know what characters you want to see next!\n\nIf you love Halloween DIY projects, FNAF, and indie horror games and want to see more of our DIY Halloween props, check out our Dancing Withered Freddy and Huggy Wuggy animatronic.

Not only does the skeleton animatronic have awesome movement, but Spring trap actually has a human body trapped inside of him, so it really fits the character. His suit parts are a mixture of EVA foam and 3D printed parts, all covered in green fleece and painted to look old and decayed.\n\nThis ended up being a huge DIY project for us, and we ran into a bunch of speed bumps along the way. We really hope you enjoyed seeing Springtrap in real life. Let us know what characters you want to see next!\n\nIf you love Halloween DIY projects, FNAF, and indie horror games and want to see more of our DIY Halloween props, check out our Dancing Withered Freddy and Huggy Wuggy animatronic.

It has been a tortuous journey for him and\neveryone around him. With each new revelation, Kanan has been forced to confront his\nfamily’s seemingly never-ending web of secrets and lies. He has spent much of this time\nin a state of denial, but now, Kanan’s blinders are finally off, and he doesn’t like what he\nsees. In season three, Kanan finds himself grappling with the very notions of right and\nwrong. Good and evil. Fidelity and disloyalty. And he’s not alone. Every member of the\nThomas family must confront an existential crisis that challenges their very identity.\nWhether it’s Marvin, who’s still trying to redeem himself, or Raq, who’s finally coming\nclean, or Lou, who’s wrestling with his own evil, or Jukebox, who’s simply trying to break\nfree from her family’s pathology, they are all attempting to redefine and reinvent themselves. They won’t all be able to complete this intensely personal quest, but for those who do, the destination may reveal the most terrifying secret of all. There is no right and wrong or good and evil. There are no absolutes. In the end, there’s just you.",

In season three, Kanan finds himself grappling with the very notions of right and\nwrong. Good and evil. Fidelity and disloyalty. And he’s not alone. Every member of the\nThomas family must confront an existential crisis that challenges their very identity.\nWhether it’s Marvin, who’s still trying to redeem himself, or Raq, who’s finally coming\nclean, or Lou, who’s wrestling with his own evil, or Jukebox, who’s simply trying to break\nfree from her family’s pathology, they are all attempting to redefine and reinvent themselves. They won’t all be able to complete this intensely personal quest, but for those who do, the destination may reveal the most terrifying secret of all. There is no right and wrong or good and evil. There are no absolutes. In the end, there’s just you."

From a custom-designed rock wall, personal elevator, and an exclusive puppy pool to a top-notch entertainment system and gourmet kitchen, this two-story doggy haven sets a new standard in pet care.
