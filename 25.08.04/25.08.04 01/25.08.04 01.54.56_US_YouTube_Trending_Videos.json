ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

                "description": "#wednesday #netflix \n\nWatch the official trailer for Wednesday Season 2. Part 1 is coming on August 6th. Part 2 is coming on September 3rd. Only on Netflix.\n\nWednesday is an American supernatural mystery comedy television series based on the character Wednesday Addams by Charles Addams\n\nThis trailer is a creative concept mashup that captures how I imagine a final trailer of 'Wednesday: Season 2' might look and feel.\n◖ An artistic idea By Teaser PRO  ◗\nMade/Edited  By Teaser PRO (Music, SFX, VFX, Art )\n\nMore Trailers\n\n◖Squid Game: USA - Season 4 ◗\n▻ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcjjPpd5s1A\n\n◖ Spider-Man: Brand New Day◗\n▻ https://youtu.be/yGcXBa9lUco\n\n◖Stranger Things 5: Volume 1 ◗\n▻ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFG39a_EoQ\n\n◖I AM LEGEND 2: LAST MAN ON EARTH◗\n▻ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTuokF7-RXA\n\n◖Harry Potter And The Cursed Child ◗\n▻ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWJepe-nxE\n____________________________________________\n\nTrailer mashups, also known as recut trailers, involve editing together various pieces of film footage (from either one or multiple movies) to create a new trailer. These mashups are often made for films that don’t exist yet, or to alter the genre of an existing movie. As derivative works, as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, trailer mashups may be protected from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.\n___________________________________________\n\n\nWednesday” Season 2 continues the gothic, supernatural story created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, with executive production by Tim Burton. Jenna Ortega returns not only as the lead but also as a producer for the new season. The first season, which premiered on Netflix on November 23, 2022, followed Wednesday Addams as she enrolled in Nevermore Academy, developed her psychic abilities, and uncovered a local mystery involving a string of murders.\n\nIn Season 2, premiering in two parts — Part I on August 6, 2025, and Part II on September 3, 2025 — Wednesday returns to Nevermore as something of a local celebrity. But visions of her friend Enid’s death lead her to a new mission: to stop it from happening — or die trying.\n\nThis season brings a darker, more horror-leaning tone, with deeper exploration of Wednesday’s powers and the secrets of the Addams family. The school has a new principal, Barry Dort (played by Steve Buscemi), and several new cast members join, including Lady Gaga as a new teacher, Yoanna Lumi as Wednesday’s ancestor Hester Frump, Billy Piper, Thandiwe Newton, and Haley Joel Osment as a villain known as “The Kansas Stripper.”\n\nThere’s more family drama this time too — especially tension between Wednesday and her mother Morticia — and her brother Pugsley is now a student at Nevermore, possibly showing signs of supernatural abilities himself."

Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN PLUSHIES: https://shop.junipercreates.com/channel/UCRkuUgtDAL4XSU5jB40J_wA/p/7351840964799\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."

                "description": "Wracamy do kasyna ze specjalnym wyzwaniem! Wydajemy 5000 dolarów na bonusy w automatach. To hazard wysokiego ryzyka z wysokimi nagrodami w najlepszym wydaniu. Wygrajmy główną wygraną za vloga, czemu nie?! Dziękuję wam wszystkim za polubienia, subskrypcje i dzielenie się swoimi przemyśleniami w komentarzach. Nawet jeśli mnie krytykujecie – nadal was kocham. Jesteście wszyscy piękni i naprawdę doceniam każdego z was za udział w tej szalonej podróży. Życzcie mi powodzenia i do zobaczenia w następnym odcinku! Chodźmy na wojnę.\n\nBrettski wkroczył w rozświetlony neonami chaos kasyna, mając 5000 dolarów palących dziurę w portfelu i szalony pomysł świerzbiący w palcach – tylko bonusy, maksymalna zmienność. Żadnych spinów bazowych. Bez litości.\n\nPierwszy przystanek: „Poszukiwany martwy lub Wild”. Wrzucił 600 dolarów. Trzy symbole VS spadły natychmiast – prowokacja z maksymalną wygraną? Bębny ustawiły się w kolejce, serca waliły jak młotem… ale ostatni symbol wild nie wypalił. Zwrot 54$. „Klasyka” – mruknął, lekko się uśmiechając.\n\nNastępnie: „The Dog House Megaways”. Kupno 700$. Ekran eksplodował lepkimi symbolami wild – dwa mnożniki 3x na początku. Psy wyrównane. Wygrana 1900$! Rozpęd.\n\nNapełniony adrenaliną, Brettski parł dalej – 1200$ do „Money Train 3”. Pojawił się wytrwały snajper. Za nim podążał wytrwały kolekcjoner. „To jest to”. Podczas gdy karmili się nawzajem, mnożąc planszę w nicość, Brettski stał z wyciągniętymi rękami jak prorok. Zysk 3600$.\n\nKapitał wynosił teraz 7800$. Pączkował.\n\nAle potem nadszedł upadek.\n\n„Mystery Museum Super Bonus”. Kupno 1500$. Pełnoekranowe premie zapowiadały grę. Trzy bębny ujawniły hełmy, dwa kolejne się zakręciły... i zatrzymały na pustych bębnach. 76 dolarów zwrotu. Skrzywił się.\n\nNastępnie: „San Quentin”. Kupno za 2000 dolarów. Razor się rozdzielił. Multisy 5x. Ale martwe obroty. 183 dolary. Otworzył się dołek.\n\nZostało 4100 dolarów, więc spojrzał na jedyny automat, którego się wyrzekł – „Tombstone RIP”. Przeklęta gra. Wysokie ryzyko. Wysokie szaleństwo. Zawahał się... a potem kupił Super Bonus 3000 dolarów.\n\nPierwsze dwa spiny były martwe. Potem – trafił mnożnik x666. Zaparło mu dech w piersiach. Zatrzymał się na premii. Zostały dwa bębny...\n\nŚwiatła zamigotały. Maszyna się zawiesiła.\n\nPotem ekran zrobił się czarny.\n\n„Błąd systemu” – wyświetlił się komunikat.\n\nSterownicy dołów podbiegli. Serce Brettskiego zadrżało. Zebrał się tłum. Czy to była usterka… czy jackpot tak ogromny, że zepsuł maszynę?\n\nOdwrócił się w stronę kamery monitoringu nad sobą.\n\nI uśmiechnął się.\n\nCiąg dalszy nastąpi...\n\n#sloty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski? Brettski to profesjonalny hazardzista, podobny do starożytnych legend: Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay czy Lady Luck HQ! Jednak w przeciwieństwie do tych legend, Brettski posiada tysiące lat starożytnej wiedzy zgromadzonej przez starszych, w takich dziedzinach jak automaty do gry, ruletka, blackjack, kości, bubble craps, poker i bakarat. Cel Brettskiego jako profesjonalnego hazardzisty jest prosty: zawładnąć całym Las Vegas, wykorzystując fundusze zgromadzone przez hazard.

Questo è il gioco d'azzardo ad alto rischio e alta ricompensa al massimo. Vinciamo un Jackpot Importante per il vlog, perché no?! Grazie mille a tutti per aver messo \"Mi piace\", per esservi iscritti e per aver lasciato i vostri pensieri nei commenti. Anche se mi state prendendo in giro, vi amo comunque. Siete tutti bellissimi e apprezzo davvero ognuno di voi per averci accompagnato in questo folle viaggio. Auguratemi buona fortuna e ci vediamo alla prossima! Andiamo in guerra.\n\nBrettski si è immerso nel caos illuminato al neon del casinò, con 5.000 $ che gli bruciavano il portafoglio e un'idea folle che gli prudeva tra le mani: solo acquisti bonus, massima volatilità. Niente giri base. Nessuna pietà.\n\nPrima tappa: \"Ricercato morto o un jolly\". Ha puntato 600 $. Tre simboli VS sono apparsi all'istante: una provocazione per la vincita massima? I rulli si allinearono, i cuori battevano forte... ma l'ultimo jolly fallì. Ritorno di $54. \"Classico\", borbottò, con un mezzo sorriso.\n\nPoi: \"The Dog House Megaways\". Acquisto di $700. Lo schermo esplose con jolly fissi: due moltiplicatori 3x caricati in anticipo. Cani allineati. Vincita di $1.900! Momento.\n\nCarico di adrenalina, Brettski continuò a spingere: $1.200 in \"Money Train 3\". Apparve il cecchino persistente. Lo seguì il collezionista persistente. \"Ci siamo.\" Mentre si alimentavano a vicenda, moltiplicando il tabellone fino all'oblio, Brettski si alzò, con le braccia tese come un profeta. Guadagno di $3.600.\n\nBancomat ora $7.800. Stava salendo.\n\nMa poi arrivò la caduta.\n\n\"Mystery Museum Super Bonus\". Acquisto di $1.500. Premi a schermo intero anticipati. Tre rulli rivelarono dei caschi, altri due girarono... e si fermarono su una ruota vuota. Ritorno di $76. Trasalì.\n\nPoi, \"San Quentin\". Acquisto di $2.000. Split Razor. Multipli 5x. Ma giri morti. $183. La sala si aprì.\n\nOra sceso a $4.100, guardò l'unica macchina a cui aveva giurato di rinunciare: \"Tombstone RIP\". Una maledizione di gioco. Alto rischio. Alta follia. Esitò... poi comprò il Super Bonus da $3.000.\n\nI primi due giri erano morti. Poi... moltiplicatore x666. Gli si fermò il respiro. Si bloccò su un premio. Mancavano due rulli...\n\nLe luci tremolarono. La macchina si bloccò.\n\nPoi lo schermo divenne nero.\n\n\"Errore di sistema\", apparve il messaggio.\n\nI direttori di sala si precipitarono. Il cuore di Brettski batté forte. Si formò una folla. Era un problema tecnico... o un jackpot così grande da rompere la macchina?\n\nSi voltò verso la telecamera di sicurezza sopra di lui.\n\nE sorrise.\n\nContinua...\n\n#slot #blackjack #gioco d'azzardo #casinò #baccarat #roulette\n\nChi è Brettski?

C'est du jeu à haut risque et à haute récompense à son apogée. Gagnons un jackpot majeur pour le vlog, pourquoi pas ?! Merci à tous d'avoir aimé, de vous être abonnés et d'avoir laissé vos commentaires. Même si vous me critiquez, je vous aime quand même. Vous êtes tous magnifiques, et j'apprécie sincèrement chacun d'entre vous de m'avoir accompagné dans cette folle aventure. Souhaitez-moi bonne chance, et à la prochaine ! En avant la guerre !\n\nBrettski s'est retrouvé dans le chaos éclairé au néon du casino, 5 000 $ brûlant un trou dans son portefeuille et une idée folle lui démangeant au bout des doigts : des achats bonus uniquement, une volatilité maximale. Pas de tours de base. Aucune pitié.\n\nPremier arrêt : « Recherche mort ou Wild ». Il a claqué 600 $. Trois symboles VS sont apparus instantanément – une annonce de gain maximum ? Les rouleaux s'alignèrent, les cœurs battirent la chamade... mais le dernier joker rata son coup. 54 $ de retour. « Classique », marmonna-t-il avec un sourire narquois.\n\nSuivant : « The Dog House Megaways ». Achat de 700 $. L'écran explosa de jokers collants : deux multiplicateurs x3 en début de partie. Chiens alignés. Gain de 1 900 $ ! Momentum.\n\nBouffé d'adrénaline, Brettski continua : 1 200 $ dans « Money Train 3 ». Le sniper tenace apparut. Le collectionneur tenace le suivit. « Ça y est. » Tandis qu'ils se nourrissaient mutuellement, multipliant le tableau jusqu'à l'oubli, Brettski se tenait debout, les bras tendus comme un prophète. 3 600 $ de profit.\n\nLe capital était maintenant de 7 800 $. Il grimpait.\n\nMais la chute arriva.\n\n« Mystery Museum Super Bonus ». Achat de 1 500 $. Des primes plein écran étaient annoncées. Trois rouleaux révélèrent des casques, deux autres tournèrent… et s’arrêtèrent sur des blancs. 76 $ de retour. Il grimaça.\n\nEnsuite, « San Quentin ». Achat de 2 000 $. Razor splits. Multis x5. Mais tours morts. 183 $. La fosse s’ouvrit.\n\nMaintenant à 4 100 $, il jeta un œil à la seule machine qu’il avait juré d’abandonner : « Tombstone RIP ». Un jeu maudit. Risque élevé. Folie extrême. Il hésita… puis acheta le Super Bonus de 3 000 $.\n\nLes deux premiers tours furent morts. Puis… le multiplicateur x666 toucha. Son souffle s’arrêta. La machine se verrouilla sur une prime. Plus que deux rouleaux…\n\nLes lumières clignotèrent. La machine se figea.\n\nPuis l’écran devint noir.\n\n« Erreur système », s’afficha le message.\n\nLes chefs de fosse se précipitèrent. Le cœur de Brettski battait la chamade. Une foule se forma. Était-ce un bug… ou un jackpot si énorme qu'il a cassé la machine ?\n\nIl se tourna vers la caméra de sécurité au-dessus de lui.\n\nEt sourit.\n\nÀ suivre…\n\n#machines à sous #blackjack #jeux d'argent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ?

                "description": "Kami kembali ke Kasino dengan tantangan spesial! Kami menghabiskan $5.000 untuk Bonus Mesin Slot. Ini adalah perjudian berisiko tinggi dan berhadiah tinggi secara maksimal. Ayo menangkan Jackpot Utama untuk vlog ini, kenapa tidak?! Terima kasih banyak atas like, subscribe, dan pendapat kalian di kolom komentar. Meskipun kalian mengejekku—aku tetap menyayangi kalian. Kalian semua cantik, dan aku sangat menghargai kalian semua yang telah ikut serta dalam perjalanan gila ini. Doakan aku beruntung, dan sampai jumpa di yang berikutnya! Ayo berperang.\n\nBrettski melangkah ke dalam hiruk pikuk kasino yang diterangi lampu neon, $5.000 menghanguskan dompetnya dan ide gila muncul di ujung jarinya—hanya pembelian bonus, volatilitas maksimal. Tanpa putaran dasar. Tanpa ampun.\n\nPerhentian pertama: \"Wanted Dead or a Wild.\" Dia langsung mengeluarkan $600. Tiga simbol VS langsung muncul—godaan untuk kemenangan maksimal? Gulungan-gulungan berjajar, jantung berdebar kencang... tetapi wild terakhir meleset. Pengembalian $54. \"Klasik,\" gumamnya, setengah menyeringai.\n\nSelanjutnya: \"The Dog House Megaways.\" Beli $700. Layar meledak dengan wild yang lengket—dua pengali 3x dimuat di depan. Anjing-anjing berbaris. Kemenangan $1.900! Momentum.\n\nDipenuhi adrenalin, Brettski terus maju—$1.200 memasuki \"Money Train 3.\" Penembak jitu yang gigih muncul. Kolektor yang gigih mengikuti. \"Ini dia.\" Saat mereka saling memberi makan, melipatgandakan papan hingga tak terhitung jumlahnya, Brettski berdiri, tangan terentang seperti seorang nabi. Keuntungan $3.600.\n\nBankroll sekarang $7.800. Dia sedang mendaki.\n\nTetapi kemudian tibalah saatnya.\n\n\"Mystery Museum Super Bonus.\" Beli $1.500. Premium layar penuh diisyaratkan. Tiga gulungan memperlihatkan helm, dua lagi berputar... dan berhenti di tempat kosong. $76 kembali. Dia meringis.\n\nSelanjutnya, \"San Quentin.\" Beli $2.000. Razor membagi. 5x multi. Tapi spin mati. $183. Pit terbuka.\n\nSekarang turun menjadi $4.100, dia melirik satu mesin yang telah dia bersumpah untuk tinggalkan—\"Tombstone RIP.\" Permainan yang penuh kutukan. Berisiko tinggi. Kegilaan yang luar biasa. Dia ragu-ragu... lalu membeli Super Bonus $3.000.\n\nDua putaran pertama mati. Lalu—pengganda x666 berhasil. Napasnya tercekat. Mesin terkunci pada premium. Dua gulungan tersisa...\n\nLampu berkedip. Mesin membeku.\n\nLalu layar menjadi hitam.\n\n\"Kesalahan sistem,\" pesan itu muncul.\n\nPara bos pit bergegas menghampiri. Jantung Brettski berdebar kencang. Kerumunan terbentuk. Apakah itu glitch... atau jackpot yang begitu besar hingga merusak mesin?\n\nDia menoleh ke kamera keamanan di atasnya.\n\nDan tersenyum.\n\nBersambung...\n\n#slot #blackjack #judi #kasino #bakarat #roulette\n\nSiapakah Brettski? Brettski adalah seorang Penjudi Profesional, mirip dengan legenda kuno Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay, atau Lady Luck HQ!

                "description": "Wir sind zurück im Casino mit einer besonderen Herausforderung! Wir geben 5.000 $ für Spielautomaten-Boni aus. Das ist Glücksspiel mit hohem Risiko und hohen Gewinnen in seiner höchsten Form. Lasst uns einen großen Jackpot für den Vlog gewinnen, warum nicht?! Vielen Dank an alle fürs Liken, Abonnieren und eure Kommentare. Auch wenn ihr mich aufzieht – ich liebe euch trotzdem. Ihr seid alle wunderschön, und ich schätze jeden Einzelnen von euch sehr, dass ihr diese verrückte Reise mitgemacht habt. Wünscht mir Glück, wir sehen uns beim nächsten Mal! Auf in den Krieg!\n\nBrettski betrat das neonbeleuchtete Chaos des Casinos. 5.000 $ brannten ihm in der Tasche, und eine wilde Idee brannte ihm in den Fingerspitzen: Nur Bonuskäufe, maximale Volatilität. Keine Basisdrehungen. Keine Gnade.\n\nErster Halt: „Wanted Dead oder ein Wild.“ Er knallte 600 $ auf den Tisch. Drei VS-Symbole fielen sofort – ein Anreiz für den maximalen Gewinn? Die Walzen stellten sich auf, die Herzen rasten … doch das letzte Wild zündete nicht. 54 $ Gewinn. „Klassisch“, murmelte er mit einem halben Grinsen.\n\nAls Nächstes: „The Dog House Megaways“. 700 $ Gewinn. Der Bildschirm explodierte mit Sticky Wilds – zwei 3-fach-Multiplikatoren vorne. Hunde in einer Reihe. 1.900 $ Gewinn! Schwung.\n\nVom Adrenalin getrieben, machte Brettski weiter – 1.200 $ in „Money Train 3“. Der hartnäckige Scharfschütze erschien. Der hartnäckige Sammler folgte. „Das ist es.“ Während sie sich gegenseitig fütterten und das Spielfeld bis zum Bersten multiplizierten, stand Brettski da, die Arme ausgestreckt wie ein Prophet. 3.600 $ Gewinn.\n\nBankroll jetzt 7.800 $. Es ging bergauf.\n\nDoch dann kam der Fall.\n\n„Mystery Museum Super Bonus“. 1.500 $ Gewinn. Vollbild-Prämien angekündigt. Drei Walzen zeigten Helme, zwei weitere drehten sich ... und blieben auf leeren Walzen stehen. 76 $ Gewinn. Er zuckte zusammen.\n\nAls Nächstes „San Quentin“. 2.000 $ Einsatz. Razor Splits. 5x Multiplikatoren. Aber tote Spins. 183 $. Der Pit öffnete sich.\n\nNun, mit nur noch 4.100 $, musterte er den Automaten, dem er abgeschworen hatte – „Tombstone RIP“. Ein verfluchtes Spiel. Hohes Risiko. Wahnsinn. Er zögerte ... und kaufte dann den 3.000 $ Superbonus.\n\nDie ersten beiden Spins waren tot. Dann – der 666-fache Multiplikator. Ihm stockte der Atem. Er blieb auf einem Premium stehen. Noch zwei Walzen ...\n\nLichter flackerten. Der Automat fror ein.\n\nDann wurde der Bildschirm schwarz.\n\n„Systemfehler“, blitzte die Meldung auf.\n\nPit-Bosse eilten herbei. Brettskis Herz hämmerte. Eine Menschenmenge bildete sich. War es eine Panne … oder ein so großer Jackpot, dass der Automat kaputt ging?\n\nEr wandte sich der Überwachungskamera über ihm zu.\n\nUnd lächelte.\n\nFortsetzung folgt …\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski? Brettski ist ein professioneller Spieler, ähnlich wie die alten Legenden Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay oder Lady Luck HQ! Doch im Gegensatz zu diesen Legenden verfügt Brettski über jahrtausendealtes Wissen, das von den Ältesten gesammelt wurde – in Bereichen wie Spielautomaten, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker und Baccarat. Brettskis Ziel als professioneller Spieler ist einfach: ganz Las Vegas zu besitzen, mit dem Geld, das er durch Glücksspiel verdient. Abonnieren Sie uns, um ihn auf seinem Weg zur Weltherrschaft zu unterstützen."
