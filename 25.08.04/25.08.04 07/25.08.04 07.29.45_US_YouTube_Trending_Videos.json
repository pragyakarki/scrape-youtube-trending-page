ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

Ve a terapia”\n\nTe siento distante, un poco arrogante, ya siento que no sentimos lo de antes, aunque yo de tu boca no sentimos nada\nSi te pillo con el gyal, si te pillara…\n\nAy, ay, ay, si te pillara\nSi te pillara, ay si te pillara\nSi te pillara, ay si te pillara\nSi te pillo los ojitos se me aguarán\nQue alguien más te toque eso me asara, si tus labios pillo con otros, lloro\n\nSi me mientes devuelve mi cora destrozado\nEso no aguanta esto me hace sentir desconfiado\nLas ganas de verte a mi lado\nLas digo en pasado\nPerdí las esperanzas porque siento que me haces a un lado\nY sisaya pero cayaya, tu haciendo lo tuyo y yo aquí en la playa\nRecuerdo tu boddy cuando guaya yeh me da nostalgia\nTe extraño tanto ya no te siento\nDuele tu decisión de dejarme en la nada\nSi esto es real como están diciendo…\nMe moriría si yo te pillara\nYou might also like\nsi mañana me muero\n\nY, ay, ay, si te pillara\nSi te pillara, ay si te pillara\nSi te pillara, ay si te pillara\nSi te pillo los ojitos se me aguarán\nQue alguien más te toque eso me asara, si tus labios pillo con otros lloro\nY, ay, ay, si te pillara\nSi te pillara, ay si te pillara\nSi te pillara, ay si te pillara\nSi te pillo…\n\n #LetraSiTePillara #LyricsSiTePillara #BeeleLetra #LyricVideo #MusicaLatina #ReggaetonRomantico #Beele2025 #MusicaUrbana #CancionViral #HitLatino #MusicaViral #TrapLatino #VideoLyrics #LetraBeele #SiTePillaraLetra #CancionDelMomento #MusicaRomantica #BeeleOficial"

                "description": "Kami kembali ke Kasino dengan tantangan spesial! Kami menghabiskan $5.000 untuk Bonus Mesin Slot. Ini adalah perjudian berisiko tinggi dan berhadiah tinggi secara maksimal. Ayo menangkan Jackpot Utama untuk vlog ini, kenapa tidak?! Terima kasih banyak atas like, subscribe, dan pendapat kalian di kolom komentar. Meskipun kalian mengejekku—aku tetap menyayangi kalian. Kalian semua cantik, dan aku sangat menghargai kalian semua yang telah ikut serta dalam perjalanan gila ini. Doakan aku beruntung, dan sampai jumpa di yang berikutnya! Ayo berperang.\n\nBrettski melangkah ke dalam hiruk pikuk kasino yang diterangi lampu neon, $5.000 menghanguskan dompetnya dan ide gila muncul di ujung jarinya—hanya pembelian bonus, volatilitas maksimal. Tanpa putaran dasar. Tanpa ampun.\n\nPerhentian pertama: \"Wanted Dead or a Wild.\" Dia langsung mengeluarkan $600. Tiga simbol VS langsung muncul—godaan untuk kemenangan maksimal? Gulungan-gulungan berjajar, jantung berdebar kencang... tetapi wild terakhir meleset. Pengembalian $54. \"Klasik,\" gumamnya, setengah menyeringai.\n\nSelanjutnya: \"The Dog House Megaways.\" Beli $700. Layar meledak dengan wild yang lengket—dua pengali 3x dimuat di depan. Anjing-anjing berbaris. Kemenangan $1.900! Momentum.\n\nDipenuhi adrenalin, Brettski terus maju—$1.200 memasuki \"Money Train 3.\" Penembak jitu yang gigih muncul. Kolektor yang gigih mengikuti. \"Ini dia.\" Saat mereka saling memberi makan, melipatgandakan papan hingga tak terhitung jumlahnya, Brettski berdiri, tangan terentang seperti seorang nabi. Keuntungan $3.600.\n\nBankroll sekarang $7.800. Dia sedang mendaki.\n\nTetapi kemudian tibalah saatnya.\n\n\"Mystery Museum Super Bonus.\" Beli $1.500. Premium layar penuh diisyaratkan. Tiga gulungan memperlihatkan helm, dua lagi berputar... dan berhenti di tempat kosong. $76 kembali. Dia meringis.\n\nSelanjutnya, \"San Quentin.\" Beli $2.000. Razor membagi. 5x multi. Tapi spin mati. $183. Pit terbuka.\n\nSekarang turun menjadi $4.100, dia melirik satu mesin yang telah dia bersumpah untuk tinggalkan—\"Tombstone RIP.\" Permainan yang penuh kutukan. Berisiko tinggi. Kegilaan yang luar biasa. Dia ragu-ragu... lalu membeli Super Bonus $3.000.\n\nDua putaran pertama mati. Lalu—pengganda x666 berhasil. Napasnya tercekat. Mesin terkunci pada premium. Dua gulungan tersisa...\n\nLampu berkedip. Mesin membeku.\n\nLalu layar menjadi hitam.\n\n\"Kesalahan sistem,\" pesan itu muncul.\n\nPara bos pit bergegas menghampiri. Jantung Brettski berdebar kencang. Kerumunan terbentuk. Apakah itu glitch... atau jackpot yang begitu besar hingga merusak mesin?\n\nDia menoleh ke kamera keamanan di atasnya.\n\nDan tersenyum.\n\nBersambung...\n\n#slot #blackjack #judi #kasino #bakarat #roulette\n\nSiapakah Brettski? Brettski adalah seorang Penjudi Profesional, mirip dengan legenda kuno Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay, atau Lady Luck HQ!

Laten we een grote jackpot winnen voor de vlog, waarom niet?! Heel erg bedankt allemaal voor het liken, abonneren en het delen van jullie mening in de reacties. Zelfs als jullie me belachelijk maken, hou ik nog steeds van jullie. Jullie zijn allemaal prachtig en ik waardeer het enorm dat jullie allemaal mee hebben gedaan aan deze gekke reis. Wens me succes en ik zie jullie bij de volgende! Laten we ten strijde trekken.\n\nBrettski stapte de neonverlichte chaos van het casino binnen, $ 5.000 brandde een gat in zijn portemonnee en een wild idee kriebelde in zijn vingertoppen: alleen bonusaankopen, maximale volatiliteit. Geen basisspins. Geen genade.\n\nEerste stop: \"Wanted Dead or a Wild.\" Hij gooide $ 600. Drie VS-symbolen vielen meteen - een plagerijtje voor een maximale winst? De rollen stonden in de rij, harten bonkten... maar de laatste wild mislukte. $54 winst. \"Klassiek,\" mompelde hij met een half grijns.\n\nVervolgens: \"The Dog House Megaways.\" $700 kopen. Het scherm explodeerde met sticky wilds – twee 3x multipliers front-loaded. Honden in de rij. $1900 winst! Momentum.\n\nVol adrenaline zette Brettski door – $1200 in \"Money Train 3.\" De volhardende sluipschutter verscheen. De volhardende verzamelaar volgde. \"Dit is het.\" Terwijl ze elkaar voerden, het bord tot in de vergetelheid vermenigvuldigend, stond Brettski op, armen gespreid als een profeet. $3600 winst.\n\nBankroll nu $7800. Hij klom.\n\nMaar toen kwam de val.\n\n\"Mystery Museum Super Bonus.\" $1500 kopen. Premiums op volledig scherm geteased. Drie rollen onthulden helmen, twee draaiden... en stopten op blanco. $76 return. Hij vertrok zijn gezicht.\n\nVervolgens: \"San Quentin.\" $2.000 buy. Razor splits. 5x multis. Maar dode spins. $183. De pit opende.\n\nNu met nog maar $4.100 op de teller, keek hij naar de enige machine die hij had afgezworen: \"Tombstone RIP.\" Een vloek van een spel. Hoog risico. Hoge waanzin. Hij aarzelde... en kocht toen de $3.000 Super Bonus.\n\nDe eerste twee spins waren dood. Toen - x666 multiplier geraakt. Zijn adem stokte. Hij vergrendelde op een premie. Nog twee rollen te gaan...\n\nLampen flikkerden. De machine bevroor.\n\nToen werd het scherm zwart.\n\n\"Systeemfout\", flitste de melding.\n\nDe pitbazen renden toe. Brettski's hart bonsde. Een menigte vormde zich. Was het een storing... of een jackpot zo hoog dat de machine kapotging?\n\nHij draaide zich om naar de beveiligingscamera boven hem.\n\nEn glimlachte.\n\nWordt vervolgd...\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski? Brettski is een professionele gokker, vergelijkbaar met de oude legendes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay of Lady Luck HQ!

Muchas gracias a todos por darle a \"me gusta\", suscribirse y dejar sus opiniones en los comentarios. Aunque me estén tomando el pelo, los sigo queriendo. Son todos hermosos, y de verdad aprecio a cada uno de ustedes por acompañarme en este viaje loco. ¡Deséenme suerte y nos vemos en la próxima! ¡Vamos a la guerra!\n\nBrettski se adentró en el caos iluminado por neón del casino, con $5,000 quemándole la cartera y una idea loca ansiosa por la cabeza: solo compras de bonos, volatilidad máxima. Sin giros base. Sin piedad.\n\nPrimera parada: \"Se busca muerto o comodín\". Apostó $600. Tres símbolos VS cayeron al instante: ¿una provocación para ganar al máximo? Los rodillos se alinearon, los corazones latían con fuerza... pero el último comodín falló. Retorno de $54. \"Clásico\", murmuró con una media sonrisa.\n\nSiguiente: \"The Dog House Megaways\". Compra de $700. La pantalla explotó con comodines pegajosos: dos multiplicadores x3 cargados al frente. Perros alineados. ¡Ganancia de $1900! Impulso.\n\nEufórico de adrenalina, Brettski siguió adelante: $1200 en \"Money Train 3\". Apareció el francotirador persistente. El coleccionista persistente lo siguió. \"Esto es todo\". Mientras se alimentaban mutuamente, multiplicando el tablero hasta el olvido, Brettski se puso de pie, con los brazos extendidos como un profeta. $3600 de ganancia.\n\nSu bankroll ahora era de $7800. Estaba subiendo.\n\nPero entonces llegó la caída.\n\n\"Super Bono del Museo del Misterio\". Compra de $1500. Se insinuaron las primas a pantalla completa. Tres rodillos revelaron cascos, dos más giraron... y se detuvieron en blanco. $76 de retorno. Hizo una mueca.\n\nSiguiente, \"San Quentin\". Compra de $2,000. Razor splits. Multiplicadores 5x. Pero giros muertos. $183. La caja se abrió.\n\nAhora con $4,100 menos, miró la única máquina que había jurado evitar: \"Tombstone RIP\". Una maldición de juego. Alto riesgo. Alta locura. Dudó... luego compró el Super Bono de $3,000.\n\nLos dos primeros giros estaban muertos. Entonces, apareció el multiplicador x666. Se quedó sin aliento. Se fijó en una prima. Dos rodillos para el final...\n\nLas luces parpadearon. La máquina se congeló.\n\nEntonces la pantalla se quedó en negro.\n\n\"Error del sistema\", apareció el mensaje.\n\nLos jefes de caja se apresuraron. El corazón de Brettski latía con fuerza. Se formó una multitud. ¿Fue un fallo técnico... o un bote tan grande que rompió la máquina?\n\nSe giró hacia la cámara de seguridad que tenía encima.\n\nY sonrió.\n\nContinuará...\n\n#tragamonedas #blackjack #juegos #casino #bacará #ruleta\n\n¿Quién es Brettski?

Mesmo que estejam me provocando, eu ainda amo vocês. Vocês são todos lindos e eu realmente aprecio cada um de vocês por embarcarem nessa jornada maluca. Desejem-me sorte e nos vemos na próxima! Vamos à guerra.\n\nBrettski entrou no caos iluminado por neon do cassino, com US$ 5.000 queimando em sua carteira e uma ideia maluca coçando na ponta dos dedos — apenas compras de bônus, volatilidade máxima. Sem giros básicos. Sem piedade.\n\nPrimeira parada: \"Wanted Dead ou um Wild\". Ele apostou US$ 600. Três símbolos VS apareceram instantaneamente — uma provocação de vitória máxima? Os rolos se alinharam, os corações dispararam... mas o último wild falhou. Retorno de US$ 54. \"Clássico\", ele murmurou, com um meio sorriso.\n\nPróximo: \"The Dog House Megaways\". Compra de US$ 700. A tela explodiu com wilds fixos — dois multiplicadores 3x carregados na frente. Cães alinhados. Vitória de US$ 1.900! Momentum.\n\nCheio de adrenalina, Brettski seguiu em frente — US$ 1.200 no \"Money Train 3\". O atirador persistente apareceu. O colecionador persistente o seguiu. \"É isso.\" Enquanto se alimentavam, multiplicando o tabuleiro até o esquecimento, Brettski se levantou, braços estendidos como um profeta. Lucro de US$ 3.600.\n\nBankroll agora de US$ 7.800. Ele estava subindo.\n\nMas então veio a queda.\n\n\"Mystery Museum Super Bonus\". Compra de US$ 1.500. Prêmios em tela cheia provocados. Três rolos revelaram capacetes, mais dois giraram... e pararam em branco. Retorno de US$ 76. Ele estremeceu.\n\nEm seguida, \"San Quentin\". Compra de US$ 2.000. Divisões de Razor. 5x múltiplas. Mas giros mortos. US$ 183. A máquina abriu.\n\nAgora com US$ 4.100, ele olhou para a única máquina da qual havia jurado desistir — \"Tombstone RIP\". Uma maldição de jogo. Alto risco. Alta insanidade. Ele hesitou... então comprou o Super Bônus de US$ 3.000.\n\nOs dois primeiros giros estavam mortos. Então — o multiplicador x666 acertou. Sua respiração ficou presa. Travou em um prêmio. Faltavam dois rolos...\n\nAs luzes piscaram. A máquina congelou.\n\nEntão a tela ficou preta.\n\n\"Erro de sistema\", exibia a mensagem.\n\nOs chefes da máquina correram. O coração de Brettski disparou. Uma multidão se formou. Seria uma falha... ou um prêmio tão grande que quebrou a máquina?\n\nEle se virou para a câmera de segurança acima dele.\n\nE sorriu.\n\nContinua...\n\n#caça-níqueis #blackjack #jogos de azar #cassino #bacará #roleta\n\nQuem é Brettski?

Wygrajmy główną wygraną za vloga, czemu nie?! Dziękuję wam wszystkim za polubienia, subskrypcje i dzielenie się swoimi przemyśleniami w komentarzach. Nawet jeśli mnie krytykujecie – nadal was kocham. Jesteście wszyscy piękni i naprawdę doceniam każdego z was za udział w tej szalonej podróży. Życzcie mi powodzenia i do zobaczenia w następnym odcinku! Chodźmy na wojnę.\n\nBrettski wkroczył w rozświetlony neonami chaos kasyna, mając 5000 dolarów palących dziurę w portfelu i szalony pomysł świerzbiący w palcach – tylko bonusy, maksymalna zmienność. Żadnych spinów bazowych. Bez litości.\n\nPierwszy przystanek: „Poszukiwany martwy lub Wild”. Wrzucił 600 dolarów. Trzy symbole VS spadły natychmiast – prowokacja z maksymalną wygraną? Bębny ustawiły się w kolejce, serca waliły jak młotem… ale ostatni symbol wild nie wypalił. Zwrot 54$. „Klasyka” – mruknął, lekko się uśmiechając.\n\nNastępnie: „The Dog House Megaways”. Kupno 700$. Ekran eksplodował lepkimi symbolami wild – dwa mnożniki 3x na początku. Psy wyrównane. Wygrana 1900$! Rozpęd.\n\nNapełniony adrenaliną, Brettski parł dalej – 1200$ do „Money Train 3”. Pojawił się wytrwały snajper. Za nim podążał wytrwały kolekcjoner. „To jest to”. Podczas gdy karmili się nawzajem, mnożąc planszę w nicość, Brettski stał z wyciągniętymi rękami jak prorok. Zysk 3600$.\n\nKapitał wynosił teraz 7800$. Pączkował.\n\nAle potem nadszedł upadek.\n\n„Mystery Museum Super Bonus”. Kupno 1500$. Pełnoekranowe premie zapowiadały grę. Trzy bębny ujawniły hełmy, dwa kolejne się zakręciły... i zatrzymały na pustych bębnach. 76 dolarów zwrotu. Skrzywił się.\n\nNastępnie: „San Quentin”. Kupno za 2000 dolarów. Razor się rozdzielił. Multisy 5x. Ale martwe obroty. 183 dolary. Otworzył się dołek.\n\nZostało 4100 dolarów, więc spojrzał na jedyny automat, którego się wyrzekł – „Tombstone RIP”. Przeklęta gra. Wysokie ryzyko. Wysokie szaleństwo. Zawahał się... a potem kupił Super Bonus 3000 dolarów.\n\nPierwsze dwa spiny były martwe. Potem – trafił mnożnik x666. Zaparło mu dech w piersiach. Zatrzymał się na premii. Zostały dwa bębny...\n\nŚwiatła zamigotały. Maszyna się zawiesiła.\n\nPotem ekran zrobił się czarny.\n\n„Błąd systemu” – wyświetlił się komunikat.\n\nSterownicy dołów podbiegli. Serce Brettskiego zadrżało. Zebrał się tłum. Czy to była usterka… czy jackpot tak ogromny, że zepsuł maszynę?\n\nOdwrócił się w stronę kamery monitoringu nad sobą.\n\nI uśmiechnął się.\n\nCiąg dalszy nastąpi...\n\n#sloty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski?

Ein verfluchtes Spiel. Hohes Risiko. Wahnsinn. Er zögerte ... und kaufte dann den 3.000 $ Superbonus.\n\nDie ersten beiden Spins waren tot. Dann – der 666-fache Multiplikator. Ihm stockte der Atem. Er blieb auf einem Premium stehen. Noch zwei Walzen ...\n\nLichter flackerten. Der Automat fror ein.\n\nDann wurde der Bildschirm schwarz.\n\n„Systemfehler“, blitzte die Meldung auf.\n\nPit-Bosse eilten herbei. Brettskis Herz hämmerte. Eine Menschenmenge bildete sich. War es eine Panne … oder ein so großer Jackpot, dass der Automat kaputt ging?\n\nEr wandte sich der Überwachungskamera über ihm zu.\n\nUnd lächelte.\n\nFortsetzung folgt …\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski?

                "description": "Nous sommes de retour au Casino avec un défi spécial ! Nous dépensons 5 000 $ en bonus de machines à sous. C'est du jeu à haut risque et à haute récompense à son apogée. Gagnons un jackpot majeur pour le vlog, pourquoi pas ?! Merci à tous d'avoir aimé, de vous être abonnés et d'avoir laissé vos commentaires. Même si vous me critiquez, je vous aime quand même. Vous êtes tous magnifiques, et j'apprécie sincèrement chacun d'entre vous de m'avoir accompagné dans cette folle aventure. Souhaitez-moi bonne chance, et à la prochaine ! En avant la guerre !\n\nBrettski s'est retrouvé dans le chaos éclairé au néon du casino, 5 000 $ brûlant un trou dans son portefeuille et une idée folle lui démangeant au bout des doigts : des achats bonus uniquement, une volatilité maximale. Pas de tours de base. Aucune pitié.\n\nPremier arrêt : « Recherche mort ou Wild ». Il a claqué 600 $. Trois symboles VS sont apparus instantanément – une annonce de gain maximum ? Les rouleaux s'alignèrent, les cœurs battirent la chamade... mais le dernier joker rata son coup. 54 $ de retour. « Classique », marmonna-t-il avec un sourire narquois.\n\nSuivant : « The Dog House Megaways ». Achat de 700 $. L'écran explosa de jokers collants : deux multiplicateurs x3 en début de partie. Chiens alignés. Gain de 1 900 $ ! Momentum.\n\nBouffé d'adrénaline, Brettski continua : 1 200 $ dans « Money Train 3 ». Le sniper tenace apparut. Le collectionneur tenace le suivit. « Ça y est. » Tandis qu'ils se nourrissaient mutuellement, multipliant le tableau jusqu'à l'oubli, Brettski se tenait debout, les bras tendus comme un prophète. 3 600 $ de profit.\n\nLe capital était maintenant de 7 800 $. Il grimpait.\n\nMais la chute arriva.\n\n« Mystery Museum Super Bonus ». Achat de 1 500 $. Des primes plein écran étaient annoncées. Trois rouleaux révélèrent des casques, deux autres tournèrent… et s’arrêtèrent sur des blancs. 76 $ de retour. Il grimaça.\n\nEnsuite, « San Quentin ». Achat de 2 000 $. Razor splits. Multis x5. Mais tours morts. 183 $. La fosse s’ouvrit.\n\nMaintenant à 4 100 $, il jeta un œil à la seule machine qu’il avait juré d’abandonner : « Tombstone RIP ». Un jeu maudit. Risque élevé. Folie extrême. Il hésita… puis acheta le Super Bonus de 3 000 $.\n\nLes deux premiers tours furent morts. Puis… le multiplicateur x666 toucha. Son souffle s’arrêta. La machine se verrouilla sur une prime. Plus que deux rouleaux…\n\nLes lumières clignotèrent. La machine se figea.\n\nPuis l’écran devint noir.\n\n« Erreur système », s’afficha le message.\n\nLes chefs de fosse se précipitèrent. Le cœur de Brettski battait la chamade. Une foule se forma. Était-ce un bug… ou un jackpot si énorme qu'il a cassé la machine ?\n\nIl se tourna vers la caméra de sécurité au-dessus de lui.\n\nEt sourit.\n\nÀ suivre…\n\n#machines à sous #blackjack #jeux d'argent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ? Brettski est un joueur professionnel, à l'image des légendes anciennes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay ou Lady Luck HQ !

L'objectif de Brettski en tant que joueur professionnel est simple : conquérir tout Las Vegas grâce aux fonds gagnés grâce aux jeux d'argent.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

            "description": "TF2 hide and seek is simple: if you're found, you die. Your goal is to survive as a hider for as long as possible, and as a seeker you need to find and kill the hiders as quickly as you can. Everyone plays as Scout only on maps that have had their invisible walls removed, and whoever has the highest total time as a hider wins! This time though, we have a plugin that automates everything we had to do manually and adds a few huge gameplay improvements (more info below). Huge thanks to muddy for developing the plugin!\n\nAlso thanks to @thewhatshow, @zenithzv, @SeaRavioli, and @CyberWizardTF2 for joining! If you like them here, their channels are worth checking out too.\n\nJoin the community!\n~ Discord: https://discord.com/invite/TFVcZUR\n~ Twitch: https://twitch.tv/greatblue\n~ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/greatblue\n\nMy other channels!\n~ Extra TF2 stuff: https://www.youtube.com/@BluesRoost\n~ More stuff with friends: https://www.youtube.com/@Chucklenuts\n\nFULL LIST OF PLUGIN CHANGES\n\n\"Balance\" changes:\n    - Seeker is locked in place for the entire countdown timer\n    - Hiders are completely silent and invisible during the countdown (minus particles and mouseover nameplate)\n    - For the 5th hint onward (15+ mins), hiders can briefly see each other through walls and are fully allowed to snitch on one another\n    - Force-A-Nature gets two knockback jumps before touching the ground instead of 1, deals 0 damage to enemies, and no longer wastes ammo when reloading\n    - Winger deals 1 damage to enemies (and yes you're allowed to shoot seekers with it because it's funny)\n    - Atomizer has its deploy speed penalty removed\n    - Wrap Assassin deals knockback on hit instead of bleed - we banned it for this session but this will be relevant in the future ;)\n    - Boston Basher deals no bleed on self or enemies\n\nAutomated stuff:\n    - Hiders are auto-switched to seeker team upon death (no more accidental spectating!)\n    - Seekers are automatically given crits and overheal upon spawning (no more surviving because the seeker has dementia!)\n    - Lets the in-game timer track the round time (no more janky editing to put a clock somewhere on the screen!)\n    - Gives an on-screen hint reminder (extra dementia repellent)\n    - Puts each time of death in chat (this actually saved me an hour of editing)",

                "description": "TF2 hide and seek is simple: if you're found, you die. Your goal is to survive as a hider for as long as possible, and as a seeker you need to find and kill the hiders as quickly as you can. Everyone plays as Scout only on maps that have had their invisible walls removed, and whoever has the highest total time as a hider wins! This time though, we have a plugin that automates everything we had to do manually and adds a few huge gameplay improvements (more info below). Huge thanks to muddy for developing the plugin!\n\nAlso thanks to @thewhatshow, @zenithzv, @SeaRavioli, and @CyberWizardTF2 for joining! If you like them here, their channels are worth checking out too.\n\nJoin the community!\n~ Discord: https://discord.com/invite/TFVcZUR\n~ Twitch: https://twitch.tv/greatblue\n~ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/greatblue\n\nMy other channels!\n~ Extra TF2 stuff: https://www.youtube.com/@BluesRoost\n~ More stuff with friends: https://www.youtube.com/@Chucklenuts\n\nFULL LIST OF PLUGIN CHANGES\n\n\"Balance\" changes:\n    - Seeker is locked in place for the entire countdown timer\n    - Hiders are completely silent and invisible during the countdown (minus particles and mouseover nameplate)\n    - For the 5th hint onward (15+ mins), hiders can briefly see each other through walls and are fully allowed to snitch on one another\n    - Force-A-Nature gets two knockback jumps before touching the ground instead of 1, deals 0 damage to enemies, and no longer wastes ammo when reloading\n    - Winger deals 1 damage to enemies (and yes you're allowed to shoot seekers with it because it's funny)\n    - Atomizer has its deploy speed penalty removed\n    - Wrap Assassin deals knockback on hit instead of bleed - we banned it for this session but this will be relevant in the future ;)\n    - Boston Basher deals no bleed on self or enemies\n\nAutomated stuff:\n    - Hiders are auto-switched to seeker team upon death (no more accidental spectating!)\n    - Seekers are automatically given crits and overheal upon spawning (no more surviving because the seeker has dementia!)\n    - Lets the in-game timer track the round time (no more janky editing to put a clock somewhere on the screen!)\n    - Gives an on-screen hint reminder (extra dementia repellent)\n    - Puts each time of death in chat (this actually saved me an hour of editing)"

Thanks to EA and DICE, I had the amazing opportunity to play Battlefield 6 early in LA and record and stream BF6 early, and I got quite a bit of time to get familiar with the Battlefield 6 gameplay.

The good news is that, even early on, things are looking great for Battlefield 6 so far, but there are still some concerns that need to be talked about…\n\nSo, what do YOU think about my HONEST REVIEW of BATTLEFIELD 6?

Instead, if the total number of player victories against this Pokémon collectively meets or exceeds one million during its event period, Shiny Chien-Pao will subsequently be available to claim via Mystery Gift during its distribution period.\n\nOfficial Playlist of Tera Raid Battle Spotlight Events: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHVppaUg_YOjRE-Z8LNB3Tjh\n\nOfficial Playlist of the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHUjZyaaGiZFozxAjjTv8zS6\n\n▶ Subscribe: ​https://bit.ly/38QZ4ZZ​\n▶ Merch: ​https://austinjohnplays.com/merch\n▶ Watch the Newest Videos Here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHW5kBAcegELKMtAH-a8RRSG&index=2&playnext=1 \n \n0:00 Results for Shiny Wo-Chien\n1:20 Doing the Raid \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nFollow Austin John Plays\n◉ Twitch: ​https://twitch.tv/austinjohnplays\n◉ Instagram: ​https://instagram.com/AustinJohnPlays\n◉ Twitter: ​https://twitter.com/AustinJohnPlays\n◉ YouTube Member: ​https://youtube.com/austinjohnplays/join\n◉ Website: ​http://austinjohnplays.com\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWatch More Austin John Plays!\n\nPokemon Tips & Tricks\nPokemon Scarlet & Violet https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHUjZyaaGiZFozxAjjTv8zS6\nPokemon Legends Arceus https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHW3eLd9CLFBJaZnBpvhYHzl\nPokemon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHUSe1Gb3XPRjroYrRTRzwNt\nPokemon Sword & Shield https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHV8_WpjI-khCa4rJ15befiQ\n\nZelda Tips & Tricks\nZelda Tears of the Kingdom https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHUB45gY82-eu4kxd1vGlxqo\nZelda Link's Awakening Switch https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHWcmHr1O0o0e7QCcr4l_jlv\nZelda Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHXsTVQDHDDU2T0pQdVCkI7d\nZelda Breath of the Wild https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwGyU0mZTYHWitiRsKE-PqxsRAceFfWXp\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nWelcome to the official Austin John Plays YouTube channel!

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\nMusic\n\nBuisness Email: aidanguyen08888@gmail.com",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\nMusic\n\nBuisness Email: aidanguyen08888@gmail.com"
