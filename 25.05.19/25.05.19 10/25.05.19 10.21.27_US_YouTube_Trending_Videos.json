Meet the Virco 9000, a plastic and tubular steel classroom staple that’s quietly shaped the experience of public education for decades. First introduced in the 1960s, the Virco 9000 has sold over 60 million units, earning its status as one of the most successful pieces of institutional furniture in history. This video dives deep into the design history of school chairs, the evolution of mass-produced classroom furniture, and how one surprisingly durable chair became a nostalgic touchpoint for millions of students.\n\nI trace the chair’s origins through the rise of tubular steel furniture, modernist design movements like the Bauhaus and the Wassily Chair, and the innovations of designers like Charles and Ray Eames. Along the way, I explore how trends in open education, Montessori learning environments, and postwar public school overcrowding created the perfect conditions for a chair like the 9000 to dominate. With its molded plastic shell, Martest seat material, and stackable frame, the Virco 9000 wasn’t just a product — it was a solution.\n\nBut the real story lies in the business side: school procurement, bulk purchasing contracts, and the power of cooperative networks like OMNIA Partners. I break down how Virco leveraged domestic manufacturing, contract bidding structures, and the logistical reality of shipping bulky assembled furniture to build an unshakeable hold on the U.S. education market. If you’re interested in industrial design, education infrastructure, or how a single object can reflect the forces of culture, policy, and commerce — this is the chair, and this is the video.",

Meet the Virco 9000, a plastic and tubular steel classroom staple that’s quietly shaped the experience of public education for decades. First introduced in the 1960s, the Virco 9000 has sold over 60 million units, earning its status as one of the most successful pieces of institutional furniture in history. This video dives deep into the design history of school chairs, the evolution of mass-produced classroom furniture, and how one surprisingly durable chair became a nostalgic touchpoint for millions of students.\n\nI trace the chair’s origins through the rise of tubular steel furniture, modernist design movements like the Bauhaus and the Wassily Chair, and the innovations of designers like Charles and Ray Eames. Along the way, I explore how trends in open education, Montessori learning environments, and postwar public school overcrowding created the perfect conditions for a chair like the 9000 to dominate. With its molded plastic shell, Martest seat material, and stackable frame, the Virco 9000 wasn’t just a product — it was a solution.\n\nBut the real story lies in the business side: school procurement, bulk purchasing contracts, and the power of cooperative networks like OMNIA Partners. I break down how Virco leveraged domestic manufacturing, contract bidding structures, and the logistical reality of shipping bulky assembled furniture to build an unshakeable hold on the U.S. education market. If you’re interested in industrial design, education infrastructure, or how a single object can reflect the forces of culture, policy, and commerce — this is the chair, and this is the video."

Virco 9000 से मिलिए, एक प्लास्टिक और ट्यूबलर स्टील क्लासरूम स्टेपल जिसने दशकों से सार्वजनिक शिक्षा के अनुभव को चुपचाप आकार दिया है। 1960 के दशक में पहली बार पेश किए गए Virco 9000 की 60 मिलियन से ज़्यादा यूनिट बिक चुकी हैं, जिसने इसे इतिहास में संस्थागत फ़र्नीचर के सबसे सफल टुकड़ों में से एक का दर्जा दिलाया है। यह वीडियो स्कूल की कुर्सियों के डिज़ाइन इतिहास, बड़े पैमाने पर उत्पादित कक्षा फ़र्नीचर के विकास और कैसे एक आश्चर्यजनक रूप से टिकाऊ कुर्सी लाखों छात्रों के लिए एक पुरानी यादों का केंद्र बन गई, इस पर गहराई से चर्चा करता है।\n\nमैं ट्यूबलर स्टील फ़र्नीचर के उदय, बॉहॉस और वासिली चेयर जैसे आधुनिक डिज़ाइन आंदोलनों और चार्ल्स और रे ईम्स जैसे डिज़ाइनरों के नवाचारों के ज़रिए कुर्सी की उत्पत्ति का पता लगाता हूँ। साथ ही, मैं यह भी पता लगाता हूँ कि कैसे ओपन एजुकेशन, मोंटेसरी लर्निंग एनवायरनमेंट और युद्ध के बाद के पब्लिक स्कूल में भीड़भाड़ ने 9000 जैसी कुर्सी के लिए सही परिस्थितियाँ बनाईं। अपने मोल्डेड प्लास्टिक शेल, मार्टेस्ट सीट मटेरियल और स्टैकेबल फ़्रेम के साथ, Virco 9000 सिर्फ़ एक उत्पाद नहीं था - यह एक समाधान था।\n\nलेकिन असली कहानी व्यवसाय के पक्ष में है: स्कूल खरीद, थोक खरीद अनुबंध, और ओम्निया पार्टनर्स जैसे सहकारी नेटवर्क की शक्ति। मैं बताता हूँ कि कैसे विरको ने घरेलू विनिर्माण, अनुबंध बोली संरचनाओं, और भारी-भरकम फर्नीचर को शिपिंग करने की तार्किक वास्तविकता का लाभ उठाकर अमेरिकी शिक्षा बाजार पर अपनी पकड़ मजबूत की। यदि आप औद्योगिक डिजाइन, शिक्षा के बुनियादी ढांचे, या एक ही वस्तु संस्कृति, नीति और वाणिज्य की शक्तियों को कैसे प्रतिबिंबित कर सकती है, में रुचि रखते हैं - तो यह कुर्सी है, और यह वीडियो है।"

Temui Virco 9000, kursi kelas berbahan plastik dan baja tubular yang diam-diam telah membentuk pengalaman pendidikan publik selama beberapa dekade. Pertama kali diperkenalkan pada tahun 1960-an, Virco 9000 telah terjual lebih dari 60 juta unit, sehingga menjadikannya salah satu perabot institusional tersukses sepanjang sejarah. Video ini mengupas secara mendalam sejarah desain kursi sekolah, evolusi perabot kelas yang diproduksi secara massal, dan bagaimana satu kursi yang sangat tahan lama menjadi titik kontak yang penuh kenangan bagi jutaan siswa.\n\nSaya menelusuri asal usul kursi melalui munculnya perabot baja tubular, gerakan desain modernis seperti Bauhaus dan Wassily Chair, dan inovasi desainer seperti Charles dan Ray Eames. Sepanjang perjalanan, saya mengeksplorasi bagaimana tren dalam pendidikan terbuka, lingkungan belajar Montessori, dan kepadatan sekolah umum pascaperang menciptakan kondisi yang sempurna bagi kursi seperti 9000 untuk mendominasi. Dengan cangkang plastik cetak, bahan kursi Martest, dan rangka yang dapat ditumpuk, Virco 9000 bukan sekadar produk — melainkan solusi.\n\nNamun, kisah sebenarnya terletak pada sisi bisnis: pengadaan sekolah, kontrak pembelian massal, dan kekuatan jaringan koperasi seperti OMNIA Partners. Saya menguraikan bagaimana Virco memanfaatkan manufaktur dalam negeri, struktur penawaran kontrak, dan realitas logistik pengiriman furnitur rakitan yang besar untuk membangun cengkeraman yang tak tergoyahkan di pasar pendidikan AS. Jika Anda tertarik dengan desain industri, infrastruktur pendidikan, atau bagaimana satu objek dapat mencerminkan kekuatan budaya, kebijakan, dan perdagangan — ini adalah kursinya, dan ini adalah videonya."

Découvrez la Virco 9000, un incontournable des salles de classe en plastique et en acier tubulaire qui a discrètement façonné l'expérience de l'éducation publique pendant des décennies. Lancée dans les années 1960, la Virco 9000 s'est vendue à plus de 60 millions d'exemplaires, devenant ainsi l'un des meubles institutionnels les plus populaires de l'histoire. Cette vidéo explore l'histoire du design des chaises d'école, l'évolution du mobilier scolaire produit en série et comment une chaise étonnamment durable est devenue un objet de nostalgie pour des millions d'élèves.\n\nJe retrace les origines de cette chaise à travers l'essor du mobilier en acier tubulaire, les mouvements de design modernistes comme le Bauhaus et la chaise Wassily, et les innovations de designers comme Charles et Ray Eames. J'explore également comment les tendances de l'éducation ouverte, les environnements d'apprentissage Montessori et la surpopulation des écoles publiques d'après-guerre ont créé les conditions idéales pour qu'une chaise comme la 9000 s'impose. Avec sa coque en plastique moulé, son assise en matériau Martest et son cadre empilable, la Virco 9000 n'était pas seulement un produit : c'était une solution.\n\nMais le véritable enjeu réside dans l'aspect commercial : les achats scolaires, les contrats d'achat groupés et la puissance des réseaux coopératifs comme OMNIA Partners. J'explique comment Virco a su tirer parti de la production nationale, des structures d'appel d'offres et de la logistique de l'expédition de meubles volumineux et assemblés pour asseoir sa domination sur le marché américain de l'éducation. Si le design industriel, les infrastructures éducatives ou la façon dont un seul objet peut refléter les forces de la culture, de la politique et du commerce vous intéressent, voici la chaise et la vidéo."

Lernen Sie den Virco 9000 kennen, ein Klassiker aus Kunststoff und Stahlrohr, der seit Jahrzehnten den Unterricht im öffentlichen Bildungswesen prägt. Der Virco 9000 wurde in den 1960er Jahren erstmals vorgestellt und hat sich seitdem über 60 Millionen Mal verkauft. Damit gilt er als eines der erfolgreichsten Möbelstücke für öffentliche Einrichtungen. Dieses Video taucht tief in die Designgeschichte von Schulstühlen ein, zeigt die Entwicklung massenproduzierter Klassenzimmermöbel und wie ein überraschend langlebiger Stuhl für Millionen von Schülern zu einem nostalgischen Anziehungspunkt wurde.\n\nIch verfolge die Ursprünge des Stuhls anhand des Aufstiegs von Stahlrohrmöbeln, modernistischer Designbewegungen wie dem Bauhaus und dem Wassily Chair sowie der Innovationen von Designern wie Charles und Ray Eames. Dabei erkunde ich, wie Trends in der offenen Bildung, Montessori-Lernumgebungen und der Überbelegung öffentlicher Schulen nach dem Krieg die perfekten Voraussetzungen für die Marktführerschaft eines Stuhls wie dem 9000 schufen. Mit seiner geformten Kunststoffschale, dem Martest-Sitzmaterial und dem stapelbaren Gestell war der Virco 9000 nicht nur ein Produkt – er war eine Lösung.\n\nDie eigentliche Geschichte liegt jedoch im Geschäft: Schulbeschaffung, Großabnahmeverträge und die Macht kooperativer Netzwerke wie OMNIA Partners. Ich erkläre, wie Virco die heimische Fertigung, Ausschreibungsstrukturen und die logistische Realität des Versands sperriger Fertigmöbel nutzte, um sich eine unerschütterliche Position auf dem US-Bildungsmarkt zu sichern. Wenn Sie sich für Industriedesign, Bildungsinfrastruktur oder die Frage interessieren, wie ein einzelnes Objekt die Kräfte von Kultur, Politik und Wirtschaft widerspiegeln kann – hier ist der Stuhl und hier das Video."

Ecco la Virco 9000, un elemento fondamentale per le aule scolastiche in plastica e acciaio tubolare che ha silenziosamente plasmato l'esperienza dell'istruzione pubblica per decenni. Presentata per la prima volta negli anni '60, la Virco 9000 ha venduto oltre 60 milioni di unità, affermandosi come uno degli arredi istituzionali di maggior successo della storia. Questo video approfondisce la storia del design delle sedie scolastiche, l'evoluzione degli arredi per aule prodotti in serie e come una sedia sorprendentemente resistente sia diventata un punto di riferimento nostalgico per milioni di studenti.\n\nRipercorro le origini della sedia attraverso l'ascesa dei mobili in tubolare d'acciaio, movimenti di design modernisti come il Bauhaus e la Sedia Wassily, e le innovazioni di designer come Charles e Ray Eames. Lungo il percorso, esploro come le tendenze dell'istruzione aperta, gli ambienti di apprendimento Montessori e il sovraffollamento delle scuole pubbliche del dopoguerra abbiano creato le condizioni perfette per il successo di una sedia come la 9000. Con la sua scocca in plastica stampata, il materiale della seduta Martest e il telaio impilabile, la Virco 9000 non era solo un prodotto, ma una soluzione.\n\nMa la vera storia sta nel lato commerciale: gli appalti scolastici, i contratti di acquisto all'ingrosso e la potenza di reti cooperative come OMNIA Partners. Descrivo come Virco abbia sfruttato la produzione nazionale, le strutture di gara d'appalto e la realtà logistica della spedizione di mobili ingombranti e assemblati per costruire una presa incrollabile sul mercato dell'istruzione statunitense. Se siete interessati al design industriale, alle infrastrutture educative o a come un singolo oggetto possa riflettere le forze della cultura, della politica e del commercio, questa è la sedia e questo è il video."

Wir haben sogar ECHTE Mobs in unserem Minecraft-Ökosystem, wie meine Eidechse Ringo, winzige Rasbora-Fische und mehr! Kannst du sie alle entdecken?\n\nIn dieser abenteuerlichen Folge reisen wir in die Wildnis, um Minecraft in echt zu erleben, während wir auf die Jagd nach echten Minecraft-Mobs gehen. Außerdem bauen wir einen selbstgebauten 3D-gedruckten Vulkan, um mit der Herstellung echter Lava für unser Minecraft-Ökosystem zu experimentieren.\n\nBleib bis zum Ende dran, um zu sehen, wie meine Axolotl Miso und Matcha ihr neues TRAUM-Minecraft-Ökosystem genießen!

I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes. \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\nDrawings to Squishies: turning my flat drawings into squishies\nFinishing Art Ideas: Choosing art ideas from my giant list and making them happen\nSquishies I've Been Avoiding: Painting on the squishies I DON'T want to paint\n\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 3:\nhttps://amzn.to/3OQpfEJ\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nOfficial Amazon Store:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/MoriahElizabeth/page/84A1B7AA-51AC-4B6B-AD8D-A20CCD5FCB47?ref_=ast_bln\n\nME SCENTS\nhttps://moriahelizabethbeauty.com/me-scents\n\nME NAIL POLISH\nhttps://moriahelizabethbeauty.com/me-nails\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nFOR GENERAL QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS:\nFanmail@Moriah.Video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nconnect@moriah.video\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with composer David Fleming (“The Last of Us”) and editors William Hoy (“The Batman”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).  \n\nDC Studios Presents a Troll Court Entertainment/The Safran Company Production, A James Gunn Film, “Superman,” which will be in theaters and IMAX® nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros.

            "description": "Felix Contreras | May 16, 2025\nCarín León is an old soul. There is no other way to account for the power of the emotion in his voice. His 16-piece band tests the limited space behind the Tiny Desk, but when the brass takes over to punctuate a performance, Leon's commanding presence shows why he's one of the best at what he does.\n\nRegional Mexican music is based upon song forms from another era, but León's lyrics add a new spin on heartbreak and love lost. This set opens with \"Ese Vato No Te Queda,\" followed by two songs from the 2024 album Palabra De To's. Previously, León premiered \"Primera Cita\" for his Tiny Desk (home) concert, which became a major hit. That song \"left a mark on our lives and completely shaped our careers,\" he shares. For good luck, León here premieres \"Por la Suave,\" which was also written by Alejandro Lozano. \"A poem that I love,\" León says.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Ese Vato No Te Queda\"\n\"Lado Frágil\"\n\"El Amor de Mi Herida\"\n\"Por la Suave\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCarín León: vocals\nArturo Garcia: guitar \nLuis Diaz de Leon Huez: guitar\nMiguel Abraham Nayares Moreno: 12-string guitar\nAlan Ortega: dobro \nJavier Humberto Sesma Rivera: tololoche\nDaniel Fuentevilla: keys\nServando Quijada: alto horn\nMarcos Barbosa: alto horn\nSebastián Quintero: saxophone, harmonica, clarinet \nJhonatan Velázquez Villegas: clarinet\nJosé Angel Avila Llunez: trumpet\nIsmael Mendoza: trumpet\nCarlos Leon: trombone\nAbel Anguiano: trombone\nAntonio Zepeda: tuba\nLuis Carlos Pérez: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #carinleon \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

                "description": "Felix Contreras | May 16, 2025\nCarín León is an old soul. There is no other way to account for the power of the emotion in his voice. His 16-piece band tests the limited space behind the Tiny Desk, but when the brass takes over to punctuate a performance, Leon's commanding presence shows why he's one of the best at what he does.\n\nRegional Mexican music is based upon song forms from another era, but León's lyrics add a new spin on heartbreak and love lost. This set opens with \"Ese Vato No Te Queda,\" followed by two songs from the 2024 album Palabra De To's. Previously, León premiered \"Primera Cita\" for his Tiny Desk (home) concert, which became a major hit. That song \"left a mark on our lives and completely shaped our careers,\" he shares. For good luck, León here premieres \"Por la Suave,\" which was also written by Alejandro Lozano. \"A poem that I love,\" León says.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Ese Vato No Te Queda\"\n\"Lado Frágil\"\n\"El Amor de Mi Herida\"\n\"Por la Suave\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCarín León: vocals\nArturo Garcia: guitar \nLuis Diaz de Leon Huez: guitar\nMiguel Abraham Nayares Moreno: 12-string guitar\nAlan Ortega: dobro \nJavier Humberto Sesma Rivera: tololoche\nDaniel Fuentevilla: keys\nServando Quijada: alto horn\nMarcos Barbosa: alto horn\nSebastián Quintero: saxophone, harmonica, clarinet \nJhonatan Velázquez Villegas: clarinet\nJosé Angel Avila Llunez: trumpet\nIsmael Mendoza: trumpet\nCarlos Leon: trombone\nAbel Anguiano: trombone\nAntonio Zepeda: tuba\nLuis Carlos Pérez: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #carinleon \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

The actor opens up for the first time about Mac’s battle with chordoma, a rare, slow-growing spinal cancer, and the strength his son showed throughout his illness: “The way he dealt with it was just pure grace and courage.” He reveals the moment they discovered Mac’s tumor on a CT scan, after months of unexplained pain: “It looks like a monster grabbing my son’s spine.” Gary reflects on a harrowing period that began with his father’s stroke, followed by his wife’s stage 3 breast cancer treatment and his son’s shocking diagnosis — and the decision he made to pause acting to care for them. Mac passed away on January 5, 2024. Gary’s wife is now cancer-free.\n\nHe has continued his work with the Gary Sinise Foundation, which supports veterans, first responders, and their families. Gary recently produced ‘Brothers After War’, a documentary about wounded heroes returning from combat, and is helping release Mac’s final music. The songs are now available, with proceeds going to the Foundation in honor of Mac’s wishes. Gary also shares the joy he finds in being a grandfather, a role that brings light amid the pain.

            "description": "The granddaddy of all barn finds! A 1966 Ford GT40 that had been stashed in a barn since 1982 now sees the light of day. In total, only 100 GT40s were made—about 30 were built specifically for the track, while the rest were made for the road. Many of the road cars were later converted into track cars, so finding an all-original road car with all its original parts is extremely rare! Follow along as Tom and the new owner, Chad, walk around and inspect this legendary time capsule.\n\nSell your car on Hagerty Marketplace: https://www.hagertymarketplace.com/?aff=prt_mkp&utm_source=partner&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=media&utm_content=video&utm_term=BFH2025\n -It's free to auction your car\n -Sellers keep 100% of the sale price\n -Dedicated support from Hagerty before, during, and after your auction\n -We respond quickly to all new vehicle submissions\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for an insurance quote, to join Hagerty Drivers Club, and for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com\n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

                "description": "Penemuan paling hebat di gudang! Sebuah Ford GT40 tahun 1966 yang telah disimpan di gudang sejak tahun 1982 kini telah melihat cahaya matahari. Secara total, hanya 100 GT40 yang dibuat—sekitar 30 dibuat khusus untuk lintasan balap, sedangkan sisanya dibuat untuk jalan raya. Banyak mobil jalan raya yang kemudian diubah menjadi mobil lintasan balap, jadi menemukan mobil jalan raya asli dengan semua suku cadang aslinya sangatlah langka!

                "description": "Il capostipite di tutti i ritrovamenti in fienile! Una Ford GT40 del 1966, rimasta nascosta in un fienile dal 1982, ora vede la luce. In totale, ne furono prodotte solo 100: circa 30 furono costruite appositamente per la pista, mentre le altre furono costruite per la strada. Molte delle auto stradali furono poi trasformate in auto da pista, quindi trovare un'auto stradale completamente originale con tutti i suoi pezzi originali è estremamente raro!

                "description": "Chicken Jockey!! Watch the movie clip from A Minecraft Movie where Garrett (Jason Momoa) must fight a baby zombie mounted on a chicken in order to save Steve (Jack Black). Welcome to the world of Minecraft, look for the movie on digital.\n\nFour misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.\n\nMovie Clip Chapters\n0:00 Fight Club\n0:40 Chicken Jockey\n2:00 That’s What Friends Do\n2:36 New Hog\n3:11 Time to Go\n4:11 Watch More\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Warner Bros.

                "description": "I bet you’re wondering “Brooklyn gets surgery *FOR REAL* ?”....Last year I was diagnosed with a skenes gland cyst and was scheduled for surgery right after I came home from Everest. Unfortunately, when they went to remove the cyst, it had ruptured and they were unable to remove it. Well a year later,  my cyst came back in my third trimester, so it was time to go in for another surgery to have it removed, for real this time!! \n\nFor anyone going through something like this, my heart goes out to you. The medical world is a big and confusing place and I hope nothing but the best for you!! \n \nMY OUTFIT: https://urlgeni.us/amzn/PXsh6\nMY GLASSES: https://urlgeni.us/Wc1Zx \nPOSTPARTUM DIAPERS: https://urlgeni.us/amzn/Uv8KO\nFACEWASH: https://urlgeni.us/amzn/tUFDW\nMY KINDLE:  https://urlgeni.us/amzn/PX3pp\nMY KINDLE CASE: https://lashnextdoor.com/collections/kindle-cases \n\n❤️'s - Brooklyn\n\nYou can check out our shop HERE: www.lashnextdoor.com\n\nDon't forget to follow us on other platforms where we post daily!\n   📸  Instagram | http://instagram.com/brooklynandbailey\n   ⏰  Tik Tok | @BrooklynAndBailey\n   👤  Facebook | http://facebook.com/brooklynandbailey\n   👻  SnapChat | http://snapchat.com/add/BrookAndBailey\n   🎶  Spotify | https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Y8tcJEqYuIDSNAZEqu9Nd\n\n\nFTC Disclaimer: This is not a sponsored video.\n\n\n💥HELP US OUT💥: You can help us translate our uploads, and get credit below each video!
