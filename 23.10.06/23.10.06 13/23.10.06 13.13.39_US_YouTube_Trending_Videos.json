            "description": "Night Swim\nComing Soon to Theaters\n\nNo running. No diving. No lifeguard on duty. No swimming after dark. \n\nAtomic Monster and Blumhouse, the producers of M3GAN, high dive into the deep end of horror with the new supernatural thriller, Night Swim. \n\nBased on the acclaimed 2014 short film by Rod Blackhurst and Bryce McGuire, the film stars Wyatt Russell (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) as Ray Waller, a former major league baseball player forced into early retirement by a degenerative illness, who moves into a new home with his concerned wife Eve (Oscar® nominee Kerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin), teenage daughter Izzy (Amélie Hoeferle, this fall’s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes) and young son Elliot (Gavin Warren, Fear the Walking Dead). \n\nSecretly hoping, against the odds, to return to pro ball, Ray persuades Eve that the new home’s shimmering backyard swimming pool will be fun for the kids and provide physical therapy for him. But a dark secret in the home’s past will unleash a malevolent force that will drag the family under, into the depths of inescapable terror. \n\nNight Swim is written and directed by Bryce McGuire (writer of the upcoming film Baghead) and is produced by James Wan, the filmmaker behind the Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring franchises, and Jason Blum, the producer of the Halloween films, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man. The film is executive produced by Michael Clear and Judson Scott for Wan’s Atomic Monster and by Ryan Turek for Blum’s Blumhouse.\n\nSocial Pages:\n\nFacebook: Facebook.com/nightswimmovie\n\nInstagram: Instagram.com/nightswimmovie\n\nX: x.com/nightswimmovie",

                "description": "An overview of the wheel/rail interactions and part of the railway engineering series.\n🥑 For 16 free meals with HelloFresh PLUS free shipping, use code PRACTICAL16 at https://bit.ly/3Ws1PYm! New subscriptions only. Varies by plan across 9 boxes.\n\nIn the 19th century, railway engineering was all about how to build railroads. Modern rail engineering focuses on getting the most out of the system. It might not look like much when you see a train passing by, but a huge amount of research, testing, and engineering went into the shape of those rails and wheels.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-why-are-rails-shaped-like-that\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

This is the last year Surly is making the Big Dummy, but I bought mine used on Facebook Marketplace for $800. The previous owner had customized it for use at his bike shop, running errands and delivering bikes to customers (yes, it tows bikes). I customized the Big Dummy for spending the day with my kids. For now, my daughter will ride on the back with her balance bike mounted on the rear, and a year from now we will include a baby seat for my son.\n\nPat https://www.instagram.com/looneygoesfastsometimes/\nTaylor https://www.instagram.com/tayweeks/\nAnna https://www.instagram.com/annatellu_hwhat/\nTJ https://www.instagram.com/timothyjamesphoto/\n\nAlt Angle Clamp https://altanglecycling.com\nKS Exaform Dropper Seatpost https://amzn.to/457i6om\nNalgene bottle cage https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/nalgene-water-bottle-cage\nKid corral https://surlybikes.com/parts/kid_corral\nKickstand https://surlybikes.com/parts/double_wide_kickstand\nCopilot Limo Seat https://amzn.to/3PwWyf5\nArclight pedals https://amzn.to/3PwHYEf\nMiles wide sticky fingers https://amzn.to/3EUAM00\nCheap bike rack https://amzn.to/3RFfYRB\n\nBerm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts\nhttps://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection\n\nCheck out our second channel for more of the same https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpP5PqrzODWpFU961acUbg\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nMusic in this video is from \nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg\n\nJoin my Patreon and 100% of the proceeds go towards projects in the mountain biking community.

Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMB01F5ZJCRFJBFO",

            "description": "September 29th, 2023, will be etched in New York City's history as the day the skies opened with an unparalleled ferocity.

Witness water roaring into basements, stranded vehicles, and impassable roads that brought the Big Apple to a standstill.\n\nThis video dives deep into the heart of the devastation, spotlighting the worst affected regions like Brooklyn and Long Island.

                "description": "September 29th, 2023, will be etched in New York City's history as the day the skies opened with an unparalleled ferocity. The deluge was so intense that JFK Airport recorded its highest 24-hour rainfall since 1948, with an astonishing 8 inches pouring down.\n\nBrooklyn faced nature's fury head-on, as three hours of ceaseless rain equaled an entire month's average downpour. Witness water roaring into basements, stranded vehicles, and impassable roads that brought the Big Apple to a standstill.\n\nThis video dives deep into the heart of the devastation, spotlighting the worst affected regions like Brooklyn and Long Island. From shattered rainfall records to streets that became rivers, experience the magnitude of NYC's epic flood crisis.

            "description": "https://www.betterhelp.com/ghosttownliving check out today's sponsor BetterHelp to get 10% off your first month of therapy.\n\nI went logging! This week I finally started a project I've wanted to do for the past 5 years. It involved getting A LOT of specific wood, which took me to Washington to meet up with my friend Jason of Mt. Baker Mining.

This week I finally started a project I've wanted to do for the past 5 years. It involved getting A LOT of specific wood, which took me to Washington to meet up with my friend Jason of Mt. Baker Mining. There, we headed to his property, collected some downed trees and went to the mill!\n\nThe result was a bunch of beautiful new lumber and the start to building a recording studio at Cerro Gordo. \n\nIf you're interested in getting involved with the studio, email: studio@cerrogordomines.com \n\nCheck out Jason's other videos: https://www.youtube.com/@SJForestProducts\n\nCheck out Haley's music: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCROTb09JwXcLOlLxxTIfqPA\n\nMore behind the scenes action on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/\n\nCerro Gordo T-Shirts and more: https://store.cerrogordomines.com/ \n\nMailing Address: PO Box 490, Lone Pine, CA 93545\n\nThank you all so much!!"

            "description": "Stephen Thompson | September 29, 2023\nWhat you've got here is a perfect 20-minute distillation of The Sam Smith Experience: The Grammy-winning 2014 ballad that kicked off the singer's career (\"Stay With Me\"), a sleek dance-pop banger (\"How Do You Sleep\") and a chart-topping dollop of debauched hedonism (\"Unholy\") bundled together with \"Lay Me Down,\" in which Smith performed a gorgeous duet with LaDonna Harley-Peters. From the stately to the louche and bawdy — Smith even introduced \"Unholy\" with a perfect summation of their recent artistic direction: \"Let's get saucy!\" — it's all here.\n\nPerforming with an 11-person choir and two instrumentalists — sadly, Kim Petras wasn't there to emerge from between Smith's legs as if she were being birthed — Smith brought an overflowing bag of tricks to the proceedings. But what really shone through was a sense of movement: Each song swayed and played effervescently, centering Smith while also elevating every other magnificent voice in support. This set may not serve as anyone's introduction to the music of Sam Smith, but it's still a hell of a gateway — and a joy to behold.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Stay With Me\"\n\"How Do You Sleep\"\n\"Lay Me Down (feat.

I'm praying this reaches everyone who need it and uplifts those who feel the weight of the world crushing them. I believe in this one. Share it with everyone and anyone and let's make an IMPACT with music for the PEOPLE spread by the PEOPLE. Someone out there needs this. Love y'all...Thank you.\n\nClick here to listen: https://dax.lnk.to/whatislife\n\nFollow DAX: @  thatsdax\nShot by: Logan Meis\nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#life #dax #faith #motivation #god #uplifting #countrymusic #rap #countryrap #whatislife \n\n\nLyrics:\n\nThis life gets real hard and sometimes you may feel your out of place\nYou may take think there’s time then blink and find it’s gone and you can’t waste\nYou gotta take a hold embrace it close your eyes and walk by faith\nAnd go today Don’t wait go today\nDon’t wait don’t wait go today \n\nLife is crazy it could switch up in a second school of hard knocks taught me how to deal with my aggression\nI was never one to cry my face was blank with no expression\nHad to keep a strong face go to war with my depression\nI hurting inside battling with my faith but God ain’t never gave me nothing I can’t overtake\nHe put me in position to get stronger through the pain to appreciate the sun after the rain \nWe gotta remind that it gets better with time and we got one life to live and it’s guaranteed that we die\nSo when we open our eyes and take a look in the sky just be thankful then conquer the day yeah\n\nThis life gets real hard and sometimes you may feel your out of place\nYou may take think there’s time then blink and find it’s gone and you can’t waste\nYou gotta take a hold embrace it close your eyes and walk by faith\nAnd go today Don’t wait go today\nDon’t wait don’t wait go today \n\nGo today don’t wait for tomorrow\nIt isn’t promised all the time you gots borrowed\nDon’t live your life for other people don’t bottle \nYour emotions till they crack and fill a cup with your sorrows ah\nTake yo mind and refocus go get a paper \nWrite your goals down throw your middle fingers at your haters \nAdd some hard-work and on top of it mix in consistent prayer say ya never gonna quit sayonara and see you later \nCause I gotta remind that we not meant to survive We’re meant to live on the moment and make the best of our lives \nSo when we open our eyes and take a look in the sky just be thankful then conquer the day yeah\n\nThis life gets real hard and sometimes you may feel your out of place\nYou may take think there’s time then blink and find it’s gone and you can’t waste\nYou gotta take a hold embrace it close your eyes and walk by faith\nAnd go today Don’t wait go today\nDon’t wait don’t wait go today \n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. This song has been one i've been using to uplift my spirits and remind myself to attack and be grateful for each and every single day and i'm glad I can finally share it with you all.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread. I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout LIFE. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world. Much love!",

                "description": "[LYRICS BELOW] \"LIFE\" is an uplifting song I wrote about seizing the moment and attacking each day. I'm praying this reaches everyone who need it and uplifts those who feel the weight of the world crushing them. I believe in this one. Share it with everyone and anyone and let's make an IMPACT with music for the PEOPLE spread by the PEOPLE. Someone out there needs this. Love y'all...Thank you.\n\nClick here to listen: https://dax.lnk.to/whatislife\n\nFollow DAX: @  thatsdax\nShot by: Logan Meis\nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#life #dax #faith #motivation #god #uplifting #countrymusic #rap #countryrap #whatislife \n\n\nLyrics:\n\nThis life gets real hard and sometimes you may feel your out of place\nYou may take think there’s time then blink and find it’s gone and you can’t waste\nYou gotta take a hold embrace it close your eyes and walk by faith\nAnd go today Don’t wait go today\nDon’t wait don’t wait go today \n\nLife is crazy it could switch up in a second school of hard knocks taught me how to deal with my aggression\nI was never one to cry my face was blank with no expression\nHad to keep a strong face go to war with my depression\nI hurting inside battling with my faith but God ain’t never gave me nothing I can’t overtake\nHe put me in position to get stronger through the pain to appreciate the sun after the rain \nWe gotta remind that it gets better with time and we got one life to live and it’s guaranteed that we die\nSo when we open our eyes and take a look in the sky just be thankful then conquer the day yeah\n\nThis life gets real hard and sometimes you may feel your out of place\nYou may take think there’s time then blink and find it’s gone and you can’t waste\nYou gotta take a hold embrace it close your eyes and walk by faith\nAnd go today Don’t wait go today\nDon’t wait don’t wait go today \n\nGo today don’t wait for tomorrow\nIt isn’t promised all the time you gots borrowed\nDon’t live your life for other people don’t bottle \nYour emotions till they crack and fill a cup with your sorrows ah\nTake yo mind and refocus go get a paper \nWrite your goals down throw your middle fingers at your haters \nAdd some hard-work and on top of it mix in consistent prayer say ya never gonna quit sayonara and see you later \nCause I gotta remind that we not meant to survive We’re meant to live on the moment and make the best of our lives \nSo when we open our eyes and take a look in the sky just be thankful then conquer the day yeah\n\nThis life gets real hard and sometimes you may feel your out of place\nYou may take think there’s time then blink and find it’s gone and you can’t waste\nYou gotta take a hold embrace it close your eyes and walk by faith\nAnd go today Don’t wait go today\nDon’t wait don’t wait go today \n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. This song has been one i've been using to uplift my spirits and remind myself to attack and be grateful for each and every single day and i'm glad I can finally share it with you all.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread. I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout LIFE. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world. Much love!"
