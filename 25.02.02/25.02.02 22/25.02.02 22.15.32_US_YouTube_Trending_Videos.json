            "title": "Benavidez vs Morrell HIGHLIGHTS: February 1, 2025 | PBC on Prime Video",
            "description": "Undoubtedly one of the best fights of the year, David Benavidez and David Morrell battled for 12 grueling rounds for Benavidez to unify the light heavyweight division by winning the WBC & WBA titles.\n\nIn a battle of unbeaten fighters in the primes of their careers, Mexican star David “El Monstro” Benavidez continued his rise to the top of the sport with a bruising unanimous decision victory over Cuban sensation David Morrell Jr. headlining a PBC Pay-Per-View event on Prime Video Saturday night from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. With the victory, Benavidez retains his Interim WBC Light Heavyweight Title and picks up the WBA Light Heavyweight Title.\n \n\"This is 'El Monstro's' world,” said Benavidez. “Shout out to Morrell, I knew he'd be tough and that's why I prepared so hard for this. I'm happy we were able to give the fans a great show tonight.”\n \n\"It was a good fight,” said Morrell. “This is boxing, some days you win and some days you lose. Tonight was my turn. I'm young and I'll keep pushing for another opportunity.”\n \nWith both fighters promising fireworks throughout the promotion, Benavidez (30-0, 24 KOs) and Morrell (11-1, 9 KOs) backed up their words from the jump, engaging in a high-octane contest that saw each fighter provide the other with the stiffest competition of their careers so far. The early Fight of the Year frontrunner featured over 1000 combined punches thrown and ended with Benavidez earning the judges favor by scores of 118-108 and 115-111 twice.\n \nAfter a back-and-forth start, Benavidez took control punch by punch, never letting Morrell breathe with his trademark series of thundering hooks and uppercuts. While the two fighters put forth a similar output of punches thrown (601 for Morrell vs. 553 for Benavidez), it was Benavidez who held a distinct edge in accuracy (40.5% vs. 27.5%) and shots landed (224 vs. 165) according to CompuBox.  \n \n\"I wasn't surprised by anything he did because I knew he was a great fighter and that I had to prepare for everything,” said Benavidez. “I knew my defense had to be good. I actually thought he'd hit harder once we were in here. He was easier to hit than I expected. Every opportunity that I saw, I went for it.”\n \nMorrell proved his championship mettle in defeat, and nearly put the momentum back in his favor in round 11 as he caught an off-balance Benavidez with a counter right hand that put him down for just the second time in his career. However, Morrell connected on a punch that was thrown after the bell ended round 11 and was deducted a point by referee Thomas Taylor.\n \nAfter yet another action packed round in the 12th, the two rivals who had shared heated exchanges and altercations throughout the lead up to fight night, embraced and showed the mutual respect gained after sharing the ring.\n \n\"It was never bad blood for me,” said Morrell. “This moment feels great because we were able to give everyone a good show. I'm going to work my way back. We'll watch this fight and learn from what I didn't do well. We'll practice more and train harder and earn another fight against Benavidez. I know I can beat him.”\n \nAfter applauding Morrell’s efforts, Benavidez then set his sights on his continued rise at 175-pounds.\n \n\"I just want to be the best of my era,” said Benavidez. “Whoever I need to fight next, I'll be ready for them. I want to unify all four titles, so if that's next, then that's next.”\n\n#DavidBenavidez #BenavidezMorrell #DavidMorrell \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

            "description": "Former world champion Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz (27-3-1, 18 KOs) edges out all-action contender Angel Fierro (23-3-2, 18 KOs) via unanimous decision (98-92, 97-93, 96-94) after 10 rounds of super lightweight action in an instant 2025 Fight of the Year contender that saw the fighters combine to throw 1,410 punches.\n \n\"I came here to fight and show the world the best of what I can do and I think I did that,” said Cruz. “I entertained the crowd and gave them a show. I'm so happy that I gave the fans a great fight with a lot of pressure like I always do and I'm proud to do it with my family here watching.”\n \n\"I came here to give the fans a great fight and leave it all in the ring,” said Fierro. “I don't care about the judges, I care about the fans. But I do hope that 'Pitbull' gives me a rematch, because I think I deserve it.”\n \nCruz and Fierro lived up to their promise to give the fans an “all-out Mexican war” as they went toe-to-toe from the opening bell, throwing powerful shots right from the outset. Mexico City’s Cruz set the tone with a huge first round, landing over 50% of his shots, including a career-best 39 power shots.\n \nTijuana’s Fierro struck back in round three, landing a powerful right hook to the temple that knocked Cruz off balance and grabbed his attention, eventually leading to a wild final minute of the round that saw both fighters land huge blows. With the back-and-forth nature of the fight set early, both continued to fight in close range until the final bell.\n \nFierro was able to keep up his impressive activity throughout the fight, throwing 786 punches to Cruz’s 624, while Cruz out landed Fierro 248 to 238. True to form, the two combatants spent the final two rounds in a pitched toe-to-toe battle that ended with the crowd on its feet in appreciation for what they had witnessed.\n \n\"I trained for eight weeks and worked really hard to leave everything in the ring,” said Fierro. “My name will stand forever, because Angel Fierro did his thing tonight. I went into the ring with determination and I fought with my heart. We showed everything that Mexican boxing is all about tonight.\"\n \n\"Fierro deserves all the respect in the world and I take my hat off to him,” said Cruz. “Thank you to all the fans who came to support me, because that's who I fight for.\"\n\n#IsaacCruz  #CruzFierro #AngelFierro \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

                "description": "Former world champion Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz (27-3-1, 18 KOs) edges out all-action contender Angel Fierro (23-3-2, 18 KOs) via unanimous decision (98-92, 97-93, 96-94) after 10 rounds of super lightweight action in an instant 2025 Fight of the Year contender that saw the fighters combine to throw 1,410 punches.\n \n\"I came here to fight and show the world the best of what I can do and I think I did that,” said Cruz. “I entertained the crowd and gave them a show. I'm so happy that I gave the fans a great fight with a lot of pressure like I always do and I'm proud to do it with my family here watching.”\n \n\"I came here to give the fans a great fight and leave it all in the ring,” said Fierro. “I don't care about the judges, I care about the fans. But I do hope that 'Pitbull' gives me a rematch, because I think I deserve it.”\n \nCruz and Fierro lived up to their promise to give the fans an “all-out Mexican war” as they went toe-to-toe from the opening bell, throwing powerful shots right from the outset. Mexico City’s Cruz set the tone with a huge first round, landing over 50% of his shots, including a career-best 39 power shots.\n \nTijuana’s Fierro struck back in round three, landing a powerful right hook to the temple that knocked Cruz off balance and grabbed his attention, eventually leading to a wild final minute of the round that saw both fighters land huge blows. With the back-and-forth nature of the fight set early, both continued to fight in close range until the final bell.\n \nFierro was able to keep up his impressive activity throughout the fight, throwing 786 punches to Cruz’s 624, while Cruz out landed Fierro 248 to 238. True to form, the two combatants spent the final two rounds in a pitched toe-to-toe battle that ended with the crowd on its feet in appreciation for what they had witnessed.\n \n\"I trained for eight weeks and worked really hard to leave everything in the ring,” said Fierro. “My name will stand forever, because Angel Fierro did his thing tonight. I went into the ring with determination and I fought with my heart. We showed everything that Mexican boxing is all about tonight.\"\n \n\"Fierro deserves all the respect in the world and I take my hat off to him,” said Cruz. “Thank you to all the fans who came to support me, because that's who I fight for.\"\n\n#IsaacCruz  #CruzFierro #AngelFierro \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"

            "description": "After the White House confirmed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods would go into affect on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced incoming counter tariffs against the U.S.\n \n“Tonight, I am announcing Canada will be responding to the U.S. trade action with 25 per cent tariffs against a $155 billion worth of American goods,” Trudeau said in an address to the nation Saturday evening.\n\nTrudeau said this will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days’ time to “allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.”\n\nThis comes after weeks of Trump repeatedly warning Mexico and Canada — two of the United States’ top trading partners — he will impose tariffs if the two countries do not end fentanyl trafficking and the flow of migrants across U.S. border.\n \nSince the initial threat, Trudeau has held several meetings with Canada’s premiers, working through plans to bolster their respective border security efforts.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/10992959/donald-trump-tariffs-canada-feb-1/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #Tariffs #JustinTrudeau #Trump",

                "description": "After the White House confirmed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods would go into affect on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced incoming counter tariffs against the U.S.\n \n“Tonight, I am announcing Canada will be responding to the U.S. trade action with 25 per cent tariffs against a $155 billion worth of American goods,” Trudeau said in an address to the nation Saturday evening.\n\nTrudeau said this will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days’ time to “allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives.”\n\nThis comes after weeks of Trump repeatedly warning Mexico and Canada — two of the United States’ top trading partners — he will impose tariffs if the two countries do not end fentanyl trafficking and the flow of migrants across U.S. border.\n \nSince the initial threat, Trudeau has held several meetings with Canada’s premiers, working through plans to bolster their respective border security efforts.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/10992959/donald-trump-tariffs-canada-feb-1/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #Tariffs #JustinTrudeau #Trump"

Tragically, all 64 passengers and crew aboard the jet, as well as the three military personnel on the helicopter, lost their lives. \nCNN.COM\n\nIn this video, Captain Steeeve provides a somber and educational analysis of the events leading up to this tragedy. We delve into the available air traffic control (ATC) communications to understand the sequence of events and explore potential factors that may have contributed to the accident. Our aim is to honor the memory of those lost by learning from this incident and highlighting the critical importance of aviation safety protocols.\n\nSpecial thanks to VASAviation for putting the ATC audio and video together.

            "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

Not only have we never seen this many racers participate in a drag and drive, the caliber of cars is unbelievable! Day 1 was a bit messy.

                "title": "Il mio vivarium gigante delle zone umide tropicali è completo",
                "description": "Ho creato un gigantesco vivarium tropicale di zone umide, il mio terzo gigantesco vivarium ecosistemico! Dopo mesi di pianificazione, costruzione dell'acquario e sistemazione della vasca con legni e rocce, era giunto il momento di piantare le nostre piante acquatiche e terrestri. Dai muschi alle viti, dalle felci coreane alle felci di Giava, la collezione di piante in questo acquascape era strabiliante. Quando il vivarium fu completato, la vasca era pronta per GAIA 3, l'aggiunta di animali delle zone umide per completare finalmente il nostro ecosistema delle zone umide. Spero che vi piaccia questa Stagione 4, Episodio 3 della mia serie Ecosystem Vivarium. Amore per le formiche per sempre!

                "title": "My NEW Giant Tropical Wetlands Vivarium is Finally Complete",
                "description": "I've finally completed my dream Tropical Wetlands Vivarium! After months of planning, tank construction, and hardscaping, it was time to add in our vast collection of terrestrial and aquatic plants. From Bromeliads to Bucephilandras, mosses to vines, Korean ferns to java ferns, the collection of plants in this paludarium aquascape was a total dream. It required me and my team to apply principles of aquascape, as pioneered by the godfather of modern aquascaping, the late Takashi Amano. Once completed, our beautiful wetlands were ready for the addition of animals (GAIA 3) to complete the wetlands ecosystem. Hope you enjoy this Season 4, Episode 3 of my Ecosystem Vivarium Series.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling!

Sind Sie schon einmal für einen längeren Zwischenstopp am Flughafen gestrandet und haben gedacht – wow, das ist wirklich das **Schlimmste**? Nun, das passiert uns ständig. Aber wir hören seit Jahren, wie großartig der Changi Airport in Singapur ist, also mussten wir ihn uns bei unserem Besuch in Singapur und Malaysia im vergangenen Sommer ansehen und 24 Stunden lang gründlich testen – um zu sehen, ob er den ganzen Hype wirklich wert ist. \n\nDas heutige Video ist also ein Schnelldurchlauf all der Dinge, die wir an einem Tag am „besten Flughafen der Welt“ besuchen konnten – wir haben viel im botanischen Garten gearbeitet, eingekauft, gegessen, Verkaufsautomaten bedient, geschwommen, (ein bisschen) geschlafen und sogar himmlischen Sex gehabt … das volle Programm. Was meint ihr? Ist das der beste Flughafen der Welt??\n\nKurzer Haftungsausschluss: Anscheinend können Sie den „Mastercard Walkway“ im The Jewel jetzt auch ohne Mastercard überqueren.

            "description": "Chapter 4 will have alot of characters, from new villains like Yarnaby, to big money makers like the Nightmare Critters, and today we talk about the new trailer!!\n\n\n#projectplaytime #poppyplaytime \n\nDescription (From Wikipedia) Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1 - A Tight Squeeze, commonly known as Chapter One or abbreviated as CH1, is the first chapter for Poppy Playtime. It was released on October 13 on Steam. It revolves around the unamed player, an ex-employee of the toy manufacturing business Playtime Co. whose employees when missing abruptly one day, and receives a letter from an anonymous sender stating that 'we're still here'. This incites the protagonist to go back to the abandoned factory and investigate it to find out what is happening. Playtime Co. is a toy-making company, and the location where the game takes place. It was likely established in the 1950s, considering the aesthetic and lack of deeply advanced technology. However, the factory likely made its demise some time past the 80s depending. In this game, you play as an ex-employee of a company labelled \"Playtime Co.\" Playtime Co. was once a corporate giant company that was in the toy manufacturing industry - that was until everybody inside the factory went missing. Now, years later, you return to the factory to investigate these unknown missing cases. One of the main mascots of PlayTime Co, he was one of the best sellers and found a place in the hearts of many children across the globe due to the fact that he was programmed to hug people, or because he was found to be cute. Nobody really knows what made him so appealing. However, due to experimentation on the toys at Playtime Co., a Huggy Wuggy seems to have come to life and gone rogue, killing everyone that crosses its path. The Player is the main protagonist of Poppy's Playtime and is the person you currently play as during Chapter 1: A Tight Squeeze. There is not much to say about The Player since we never get an introduction to who they could be. However, there's a recurring theory that the live toys, such as the murderous HH, were actually human experiments. There's a theory that the player has ties to whoever was running the operation, or looked similar to them, which is why they were so ferociously attacked. This is not canon, and this may be disputed later on as more lore is revealed. Poppy Playtime is a minor character inside Chapter 1, and will most likely be an important character for the upcoming chapters. Poppy is a highly intelligent toy, she has the ability to properly converse with a child. She's also programmed to talk and communicate like a real little girl. Her first debut is in Chapter 1 and is featured inside the first VHS tape the player receives in the game, in which she appears in her own commercial tape. The Grab Pack was shown to have been used by factory workers to do heavy lifting and general tasks that would have been hard for the average man to do alone, or even in groups. Not to mention, that in the chase scene, the player used it to pull a huge box over an entrance to deter a murderous Huggy Wuggy, and instead destroys the entire mesh floor with the box and takes Huggy Wuggy down with it. This shows that it's incredibly powerful, managing to pull down a box like that with ease. In VHS 2, it's also shown that it can easily decapitate a person with relative ease. In VHS 2, because of this, it was strongly advised to use these with care for that very reason. Decapitating your coworker is not ideal. (Steam Page) You must stay alive in this horror/puzzle adventure. Try to survive the vengeful toys waiting for you in the abandoned toy factory. Use your GrabPack to hack electrical circuits or nab anything from afar. Explore the mysterious facility... and don't get caught.\n\nThe game has been a little controversial for accusations relating to NFTs, tracing renders, and of course being deemed as \"money hungry\" for selling tons of plushes on their website, amazon marketplace, and even making toys like Nightmare critters debatedly for the purpose of making money. Regardless, the games are still super high quality, and I still love talking about it and playing it!",

Now my attempt at this challenge is a rip on this incredible video by the wonderful @ambiguousamphibian https://youtu.be/0hBpDWiMzK0?si=qCrBCJ1-kwzgmueN\n\nIn this video AA attempts to survive without leaving his starting house. A seemingly impossible challenge however it is enthralling. Now I similarly am in a tricky situation. Trapped inside a single house on the edge of rosewood our goal is to survive longer than AA manages and exploit the games new overpowered mechanics bugs and glitches along the way! But who knows what weird tricks and turns we might find along the way...\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nChapters: \n00:00 - Intro\n02:22 - Character Creation\n03:32 - Day 1\n10:56 - Day 2\n16:29 - Day 3\n17:38 - Day 4\n18:46 - Day 5\n20:52 - Day 6\n22:53 - Day 7\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\n#gaming #challenge #trapped",
