Visit SimpliSafe dot com slash BAILEY to customize yours. There’s No Safe Like SimpliSafe.\n\n_________\n\n*LAST CHANCE* ... tickets are available until November 12th to watch a replay of MURDER MYSTERY & MAKEUP - A Live Digital Premiere over to https://moment.co/mmm.\n\nI aired my first ever live event on October 15. And it's honestly really hard to explain how much fun it all was. We laughed, we got spiritual and I shared some things I've never really talked about before. Vulnerability! Thank you, to everyone, who bought tickets and joined me. I'll never forget this experience.\n\nNow... if you missed the event... don't you worry. I got you. For the next 28 days, you can still buy a ticket to watch MMM Live. Now why would you buy a ticket to a live event that is no longer live, you ask? Good question.\n\nWell... this is an exclusive episode that cannot be seen anywhere else. Including YouTube. After November 12th... this story, all the hot gos and insider makeup tips are... POOF... gone forever.\n\n***GET TICKETS at https://moment.co/mmm***\n\nThis was a one night only event you don't want to miss and it cannot be seen anywhere else but Moment by Patreon.\n\n_________\n\nHi friends, happy Monday!\n\nHow far would you go for love? Well... for one woman named Dolly... there was no such thing as \"too far.\" I mean... I gotta hand it to her. This woman knew what she wanted romantically and she went and got it.\n\nBut at a certain point, Dolly's thirst for steamy, sultry romance turned into something much more sinister. And a whole bunch of men got caught up in her web of destruction.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n00:00 - INTRO\n04:03 - EARLY LIFE & MARRIAGE\n07:00 - DOLLY TAKES A LOVER\n10:17 - THE ATTIC CONDITIONS & FRED'S SUSPICIONS \n12:04 - THE MOVE TO L.A.\n14:18 - MOMENT!\n16:18 - A FATEFUL FIGHT\n19:44 - THE GRIEVING WIDOW'S STORY COLLAPSES\n23:30 - OTTER'S CONFESSION & DOLLY'S CHARGES\n26:24 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  :\n\nFACE\n\n-Neogen Calming Micellar Cleansing Oil\nhttps://bit.ly/4fjeXrs\n\n-Neogen Calming Cicatree Micellar Cleansing Foam\nhttps://howl.link/t160aamhz496r\n\n-Neogen Bio-Peel + Gauze Peeling Wine\nhttps://howl.link/okje9m9bfp93u\n\n-Neogen Hyal Glow Rose Essence\nhttps://howl.link/mkmh6y00qic30\n\n-Neogen Real Heartleaf Soothing Daily Mask\n​​https://howl.link/qdguzzg8w6bms\n\n-d’Alba White Truffle Double Serum & Cream\nhttps://howl.link/75265zpoki922\n\nEYES\n\n-Neogen Extra Clear Eye Remover\nhttps://bit.ly/3O2RjDq\n\n-Peter Thomas Roth 24K Gold Hydra-Gel Eye Patches\nhttps://howl.link/vxjpi07ua6qg5\n\n-Saturday Skin Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream\nhttps://howl.link/gzwu379dm0qwl\n\nLIPS\n\n-La Roch-Posay Cicaplast Lips Hydration Restore Lip Balm\nhttps://howl.link/e8mdfq4w0s3f7",

I talk about heat pumps a lot. They really are the most energy efficient way to heat and cool things, but the study of caloric cooling represents the potential for a new, solid-state-esque approach to managing heat. Yup, solid state. That comes with the possibility of achieving significantly higher efficiencies without refrigerants. Caloric cooling holds massive implications for the way we cool our homes, our vehicles, and maybe even ourselves. So, how does it all work?

            "description": "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is streaming February 13 on Peacock: https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-movies/bridget-jones-mad-about-the-boy\n\nTwo-time Academy Award® winner Renée Zellweger returns to the role that established a romantic-comedy heroine for the ages, a woman whose inimitable approach to life and love redefined an entire film genre.   \n  \nBridget Jones first blasted onto bookshelves in Helen Fielding’s literary phenomenon Bridget Jones’s Diary, which became a global bestseller and a blockbuster film. As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug-Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.  \n \nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark (Oscar® winner Colin Firth) was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 9-year-old Billy and 4-year-old Mabel, and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends and even her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  \n  \nPressured by her Urban Family —Shazzer, Jude and Tom, her work colleague Miranda, her mother, and her gynecologist Dr. Rawlings (Oscar® winner Emma Thompson) — to forge a new path toward life and love, Bridget goes back to work and even tries out the dating apps, where she’s soon pursued by a dreamy and enthusiastic younger man (White Lotus’s Leo Woodall). Now juggling work, home and romance, Bridget grapples with the judgment of the perfect mums at school, worries about Billy as he struggles with the absence of his father, and engages in a series of awkward interactions with her son’s rational-to-a-fault science teacher (Oscar® nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor). The returning cast includes Oscar® winner Jim Broadbent and BAFTA winner Gemma Jones as Bridget’s parents and, as a new character, Isla Fisher (Now You See Me, The Great Gatsby) as Rebecca, Bridget’s neighbor.  \n \nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Michael Morris (To Leslie, Better Call Saul), from a screenplay by BAFTA nominee Helen Fielding, based on her novel, with contributions from Emmy winner Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady, Eric) and Oscar® nominee Dan Mazer (I Give it A Year, Bridget Jones’s Baby).  \n \nThe film is produced for Working Title by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, whose films, including The Danish Girl, Darkest Hour, Fargo, Les Misérables and The Theory of Everything, among others, have earned 14 Academy Awards® and six Best Picture nominations. The film is also produced by Jo Wallett (Wicked Little Letters, Catherine Called Birdy). The film is executive produced by Helen Fielding, Renée Zellweger, Amelia Granger and Sarah-Jane Wright. Working Title has produced all the Bridget Jones films.  \n \nUniversal Pictures and StudioCanal and Miramax present a Working Title production, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. The film will be released in theaters internationally by Universal Pictures and will stream exclusively on Peacock in the U.S.\n\n#BridgetJonesMovie #peacock  #officialtrailer",

            "description": "Cars once promised independence and transportation for all Americans. Now, they are a luxury product that cost about $50,000, nearly 30% higher than just a few years ago. Affordable vehicles, especially those below the price of $20,000, have nearly disappeared. And while Automakers pulled in record profits in 2023, slim margins combined with deep investments into EV batteries, software and other technology is making it hard to produce cars much cheaper. Chinese automakers can, but they're impeded by tariffs and rules. Insiders say that is just a bandage - automakers need to compete.\n\nChapters:\n00:56 Title card - Why American automakers can’t make cheap cars \n1:05 Chapter 1 - Affordability \n3:02 Chapter 2 - How cars got so expensive \n6:07 Chapter 3 - Making a cheaper car\n9:08 Chapter 4 - Competing with China \n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Evan Lee Miller\nAnimation: Jason Reginato, Christina Locopo\nAdditional Camera: Natalie Rice\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ford, Getty Images, GMC, Hyundai, Rivian Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

                "title": "Why American Cars Are So Expensive",
                "description": "Cars once promised independence and transportation for all Americans. Now, they are a luxury product that cost about $50,000, nearly 30% higher than just a few years ago. Affordable vehicles, especially those below the price of $20,000, have nearly disappeared. And while Automakers pulled in record profits in 2023, slim margins combined with deep investments into EV batteries, software and other technology is making it hard to produce cars much cheaper. Chinese automakers can, but they're impeded by tariffs and rules. Insiders say that is just a bandage - automakers need to compete.\n\nChapters:\n00:56 Title card - Why American automakers can’t make cheap cars \n1:05 Chapter 1 - Affordability \n3:02 Chapter 2 - How cars got so expensive \n6:07 Chapter 3 - Making a cheaper car\n9:08 Chapter 4 - Competing with China \n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Evan Lee Miller\nAnimation: Jason Reginato, Christina Locopo\nAdditional Camera: Natalie Rice\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ford, Getty Images, GMC, Hyundai, Rivian Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

            "description": "Discover the journey that forged a kingdom. \n\nWatch the new trailer for #Mufasa: The Lion King and see the movie only in theaters December 20.\n\nExploring the unlikely rise of the beloved king of the Pride Lands, “Mufasa: The Lion King” enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny—their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe. The film features an all-star roster of talent, including Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr., John Kani, Tiffany Boone, Kagiso Lediga, Preston Nyman, Mads Mikkelsen, Thandiwe Newton, Lennie James, Anika Noni Rose, Keith David, Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, Donald Glover, Blue Ivy Carter, Braelyn Rankins, Theo Somolu, Folake Olowofoyeku, Joanna Jones, Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, Abdul Salis, Dominique Jennings and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter. Blending live-action filmmaking techniques with photoreal computer-generated imagery, the all-new feature film is directed by Barry Jenkins, produced by Adele Romanski & Mark Ceryak, and executive produced by Peter Tobyansen. Featuring songs by award-winning songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda, “Mufasa: The Lion King” opens only in theaters on Dec. 20, 2024.",
