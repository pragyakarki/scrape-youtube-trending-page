            "description": "Brasil parece no poder encontrar su rumbo y, después de haber logrado dos victorias en la última doble fecha, se tuvo que contentar con un empate por 1-1 ante Venezuela, en el marco de las Eliminatorias Sudamericanas.\n\nDesde el inicio, el Scratch parecía más decidido a romper el cero en el marcador. Así, la acumulación de chances en favor del equipo de Dorival Junior se hacía presente, incluso con un remate en el palo de Vinicius que, tras el rebote, Gerson no pudo enviar al fondo de la red.\n\nVenezuela resistía, pero los errores desde el fondo en Brasil le presentaban oportunidades. Sin embargo, la falta de puntería también se hizo presente en la Vinotinto que, si no se encontraba con la humanidad de Ederson, tampoco le embocaba al arco. De todas maneras, el primer tiempo era de ida y vuelta y los 22 jugadores dentro del campo de juego entretenían a los presentes.\n\nLa igualdad finalmente se rompería sobre el final del primer tiempo, de la mano de un potente tiro libre de Raphinha a los 42 minutos que logró engañar a Rafael Romo, quien no logró contener el remate a pesar de que el mismo fue hacia su palo. La reacción de los locales no tardó en aparecer y un centro frontal encontró a Salomón Rondón, pero el capitán del equipo de Fernando Batista no pudo rematar con comodidad y su intento quedó en las manos de Ederson.\n\nEl vértigo persistió en el segundo tiempo ya que, antes del minuto de juego, Telasco Segovia conectó un lindo centro atrás de Jefferson Savarino para romperle el arco a Ederson y poner las cosas 1-1 en el marcador, para el delirio de los hinchas locales. La alegría, sin embargo, duró poco ya que, a los 13 minutos, una infracción sobre Vinícius en el borde del área fue sancionada con un penal -VAR mediante- para Brasil. De todas maneras, para fortuna del equipo del Bocha Batista, el delantero de Real Madrid malogró su intento desde los 12 pasos y también en el rebote, luego de que Romo evite la caída de su valla.\n\nLa expulsión de Alexander González sobre el final del partido amagó con generar espacios para que Brasil encuentre la victoria, pero poco tiempo quedaba en el reloj para que el Scratch consiga el gol de la diferencia. Así, las cosas terminaron 1-1 en Maturín, un empate que dejó a Brasil en el tercer puesto de las Eliminatorias con 17 unidades, mientras que Venezuela se consolida, momentáneamente, en el 7° puesto con 12 unidades, en zona de repechaje.\n\nAhora, el equipo de Batista vistará a Chile el próximo 19 de noviembre para cerrar la doble fecha, mientras que los brasileños recibirán a Uruguay en el último partido de la jornada, el mismo día.\n\nPara más información, visitá http://www.tycsports.com",

            "description": "Journey back to 1964 and experience Beatlemania like never before. \n\nFrom producer Martin Scorsese and director David Tedeschi, stream Beatles '64, an original documentary, only on @disneyplus November 29.\n\nThe film captures the electrifying moment of The Beatles’ first visit to America.  On February 7, 1964, The Beatles arrived in New York City to unprecedented excitement and hysteria. From the instant they landed at Kennedy Airport, met by thousands of fans, Beatlemania swept New York and the entire country. Their thrilling debut performance on The Ed Sullivan Show captivated more than 73 million viewers, the most watched television event of its time. Beatles ’64 presents the spectacle, but also tells a more intimate behind the scenes story, capturing the camaraderie of John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they experienced unimaginable fame.\n\nThe film includes rare footage filmed by pioneering documentarians Albert and David Maysles, beautifully restored in 4K by Park Road Post in New Zealand. The live performances from The Beatles’ first American concert at the Washington, DC Coliseum and their Ed Sullivan appearances were demixed by WingNut Films and remixed by Giles Martin. Spotlighting this singular cultural moment and its continued resonance today, the music and footage are augmented by newly filmed interviews with Paul and Ringo, as well as fans whose lives were transformed by The Beatles.\n\nBeatles ’64 is directed by David Tedeschi and produced by Martin Scorsese, Margaret Bodde, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison, Sean Ono Lennon, Jonathan Clyde, and Mikaela Beardsley, with Jeff Jones and Rick Yorn serving as executive producers.\n\n@johnlennon @PaulMcCartney @GeorgeHarrisonOfficial @ringostarr",

The all-new espionage thriller opens in theaters nationwide April 11, 2025.\n\nCharlie Heller (Malek) is a brilliant, but deeply introverted decoder for the CIA working out of a basement office at headquarters in Langley whose life is turned upside down when his wife is killed in a London terrorist attack. When his supervisors refuse to take action, he takes matters into his own hands, embarking on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible, his intelligence serving as the ultimate weapon for eluding his pursuers and achieving his revenge. The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, Danny Sapani, and Laurence Fishburne. “The Amateur” is directed by James Hawes. The screenplay is by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli based on the novel by Robert Littell. The film is produced by Hutch Parker, p.g.a., Dan Wilson, p.g.a., Rami Malek, Joel B. Michaels, with JJ Hook serving as executive producer.",

Watch the full episode of British Vogue’s ‘In The Bag,’ as Molly-Mae Hague gives us a sneak peek inside her Bottega Veneta bag.\r\n\r\n#MollyMae #LoveIsland #Vogue\r\n\r\nBritish Vogue recommends:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AktnCu1Ulho\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7dfwKMa_gs\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff4CEmLjaOE\r\n\r\nWatch more from British Vogue | In The Bag:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHlfmUA9UkXboTP1VQSiVafeE1TywnEM8\r\n\r\nWatch more from British Vogue:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDNMF5QjkTU\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ltxqt-hF4\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLgLbdiBLCU\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDirector\r\nJack Bowden\r\n\r\nEditor\r\nRachel Kosminsky \r\n\r\nDirector of Photography\r\nChaimuki \r\n\r\nFeaturing\r\nMolly-Mae Hague\r\n\r\nDirector of Creative Production\r\nMinnie J Carver\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nProducer \r\nRashida Josiah\r\n\r\nCreative Production Coordinator\r\nMotunrayo Soyannwo\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nCamera Operator\r\nIrys Steel\r\n\r\nGaffer\r\nDylan Schultz-Soo\r\n\r\nSound Recordist \r\nJermaine Monero\r\n\r\nRunner\r\nNur Pangarker\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nStylist\r\nJessica Gerardi\r\n\r\nFashion Assistant\r\nRosa Weait\r\n\r\nMake-up Artist\r\nErin Green\r\n\r\nHairstylist\r\nClaire Moore\r\n\r\nHairstylist’s Assistant\r\nJay Doan\r\n\r\nManicurist\r\nSaffron Goddard\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nPost Production Supervisor\r\nAlexa Deutsch\r\n\r\nSupervising Editor \r\nErica DeLeo\r\n\r\nPost Production Coordinator\r\nHolly Frew\r\n\r\nAssistant Editor\r\nFynn Lithgow\r\n\r\nAssociate Director, Post Production\r\nNicholas Ascanio\r\n\r\nExecutive Producer\r\nRahel Gebreyes\r\n\r\nVice President, Video\r\nThespena Guatieri\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\nBlooming Haus\r\nThe Kensington Hotel\n\nSubscribe to British Vogue►► https://www.youtube.com/britishvogue?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nCONNECT WITH BRITISH VOGUE\r\nWeb: https://www.vogue.co.uk\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/britishvogue\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/britishvogue\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/britishvogue\r\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/britishvogue\r\nNewsletter: https://www.vogue.co.uk/newsletters\r\nSubscribe: https://www.vogue.co.uk/subscribe\r\n\r\nABOUT BRITISH VOGUE\r\nBritish Vogue is the world’s leading premium lifestyle and fashion entertainment channel.

Visit SimpliSafe dot com slash BAILEY to customize yours. There’s No Safe Like SimpliSafe.\n\n_________\n\n*LAST CHANCE* ... tickets are available until November 12th to watch a replay of MURDER MYSTERY & MAKEUP - A Live Digital Premiere over to https://moment.co/mmm.\n\nI aired my first ever live event on October 15. And it's honestly really hard to explain how much fun it all was. We laughed, we got spiritual and I shared some things I've never really talked about before. Vulnerability! Thank you, to everyone, who bought tickets and joined me. I'll never forget this experience.\n\nNow... if you missed the event... don't you worry. I got you. For the next 28 days, you can still buy a ticket to watch MMM Live. Now why would you buy a ticket to a live event that is no longer live, you ask? Good question.\n\nWell... this is an exclusive episode that cannot be seen anywhere else. Including YouTube. After November 12th... this story, all the hot gos and insider makeup tips are... POOF... gone forever.\n\n***GET TICKETS at https://moment.co/mmm***\n\nThis was a one night only event you don't want to miss and it cannot be seen anywhere else but Moment by Patreon.\n\n_________\n\nHi friends, happy Monday!\n\nHow far would you go for love? Well... for one woman named Dolly... there was no such thing as \"too far.\" I mean... I gotta hand it to her. This woman knew what she wanted romantically and she went and got it.\n\nBut at a certain point, Dolly's thirst for steamy, sultry romance turned into something much more sinister. And a whole bunch of men got caught up in her web of destruction.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n00:00 - INTRO\n04:03 - EARLY LIFE & MARRIAGE\n07:00 - DOLLY TAKES A LOVER\n10:17 - THE ATTIC CONDITIONS & FRED'S SUSPICIONS \n12:04 - THE MOVE TO L.A.\n14:18 - MOMENT!\n16:18 - A FATEFUL FIGHT\n19:44 - THE GRIEVING WIDOW'S STORY COLLAPSES\n23:30 - OTTER'S CONFESSION & DOLLY'S CHARGES\n26:24 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  :\n\nFACE\n\n-Neogen Calming Micellar Cleansing Oil\nhttps://bit.ly/4fjeXrs\n\n-Neogen Calming Cicatree Micellar Cleansing Foam\nhttps://howl.link/t160aamhz496r\n\n-Neogen Bio-Peel + Gauze Peeling Wine\nhttps://howl.link/okje9m9bfp93u\n\n-Neogen Hyal Glow Rose Essence\nhttps://howl.link/mkmh6y00qic30\n\n-Neogen Real Heartleaf Soothing Daily Mask\n​​https://howl.link/qdguzzg8w6bms\n\n-d’Alba White Truffle Double Serum & Cream\nhttps://howl.link/75265zpoki922\n\nEYES\n\n-Neogen Extra Clear Eye Remover\nhttps://bit.ly/3O2RjDq\n\n-Peter Thomas Roth 24K Gold Hydra-Gel Eye Patches\nhttps://howl.link/vxjpi07ua6qg5\n\n-Saturday Skin Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream\nhttps://howl.link/gzwu379dm0qwl\n\nLIPS\n\n-La Roch-Posay Cicaplast Lips Hydration Restore Lip Balm\nhttps://howl.link/e8mdfq4w0s3f7",

            "description": "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is streaming February 13 on Peacock: https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-movies/bridget-jones-mad-about-the-boy\n\nTwo-time Academy Award® winner Renée Zellweger returns to the role that established a romantic-comedy heroine for the ages, a woman whose inimitable approach to life and love redefined an entire film genre.   \n  \nBridget Jones first blasted onto bookshelves in Helen Fielding’s literary phenomenon Bridget Jones’s Diary, which became a global bestseller and a blockbuster film. As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug-Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.  \n \nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark (Oscar® winner Colin Firth) was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 9-year-old Billy and 4-year-old Mabel, and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends and even her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  \n  \nPressured by her Urban Family —Shazzer, Jude and Tom, her work colleague Miranda, her mother, and her gynecologist Dr. Rawlings (Oscar® winner Emma Thompson) — to forge a new path toward life and love, Bridget goes back to work and even tries out the dating apps, where she’s soon pursued by a dreamy and enthusiastic younger man (White Lotus’s Leo Woodall). Now juggling work, home and romance, Bridget grapples with the judgment of the perfect mums at school, worries about Billy as he struggles with the absence of his father, and engages in a series of awkward interactions with her son’s rational-to-a-fault science teacher (Oscar® nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor). The returning cast includes Oscar® winner Jim Broadbent and BAFTA winner Gemma Jones as Bridget’s parents and, as a new character, Isla Fisher (Now You See Me, The Great Gatsby) as Rebecca, Bridget’s neighbor.  \n \nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Michael Morris (To Leslie, Better Call Saul), from a screenplay by BAFTA nominee Helen Fielding, based on her novel, with contributions from Emmy winner Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady, Eric) and Oscar® nominee Dan Mazer (I Give it A Year, Bridget Jones’s Baby).  \n \nThe film is produced for Working Title by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, whose films, including The Danish Girl, Darkest Hour, Fargo, Les Misérables and The Theory of Everything, among others, have earned 14 Academy Awards® and six Best Picture nominations. The film is also produced by Jo Wallett (Wicked Little Letters, Catherine Called Birdy). The film is executive produced by Helen Fielding, Renée Zellweger, Amelia Granger and Sarah-Jane Wright. Working Title has produced all the Bridget Jones films.  \n \nUniversal Pictures and StudioCanal and Miramax present a Working Title production, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. The film will be released in theaters internationally by Universal Pictures and will stream exclusively on Peacock in the U.S.\n\n#BridgetJonesMovie #peacock  #officialtrailer",

She’s now a single mother to 9-year-old Billy and 4-year-old Mabel, and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends and even her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  \n  \nPressured by her Urban Family —Shazzer, Jude and Tom, her work colleague Miranda, her mother, and her gynecologist Dr. Rawlings (Oscar® winner Emma Thompson) — to forge a new path toward life and love, Bridget goes back to work and even tries out the dating apps, where she’s soon pursued by a dreamy and enthusiastic younger man (White Lotus’s Leo Woodall). Now juggling work, home and romance, Bridget grapples with the judgment of the perfect mums at school, worries about Billy as he struggles with the absence of his father, and engages in a series of awkward interactions with her son’s rational-to-a-fault science teacher (Oscar® nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor). The returning cast includes Oscar® winner Jim Broadbent and BAFTA winner Gemma Jones as Bridget’s parents and, as a new character, Isla Fisher (Now You See Me, The Great Gatsby) as Rebecca, Bridget’s neighbor.  \n \nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Michael Morris (To Leslie, Better Call Saul), from a screenplay by BAFTA nominee Helen Fielding, based on her novel, with contributions from Emmy winner Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady, Eric) and Oscar® nominee Dan Mazer (I Give it A Year, Bridget Jones’s Baby).  \n \nThe film is produced for Working Title by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, whose films, including The Danish Girl, Darkest Hour, Fargo, Les Misérables and The Theory of Everything, among others, have earned 14 Academy Awards® and six Best Picture nominations. The film is also produced by Jo Wallett (Wicked Little Letters, Catherine Called Birdy). The film is executive produced by Helen Fielding, Renée Zellweger, Amelia Granger and Sarah-Jane Wright. Working Title has produced all the Bridget Jones films.  \n \nUniversal Pictures and StudioCanal and Miramax present a Working Title production, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. The film will be released in theaters internationally by Universal Pictures and will stream exclusively on Peacock in the U.S.\n\n#BridgetJonesMovie #peacock  #officialtrailer"
