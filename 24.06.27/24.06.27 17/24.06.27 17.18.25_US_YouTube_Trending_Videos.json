I mean, perhaps somewhere deep down in their cold, dead hearts they still do? But Mike asks Rich to watch The Acolyte because Mike knows Rich is one of the most honest, unbiased people he's ever met. Rich will tell it like it is. He’ll never sugar-coat anything. Now, this video is less about The Acolyte and more about the culture war surrounding it. After Ghostbusters 2016, they felt we were all past this as human beings. A movie or show is good or bad based on the quality and nothing else. Mike saw the figurative streets set on fire after the “Lesbian Witch” episode and his curiosity was piqued. What is this? What’s all the fuss? Then there is the now famous \"R2D2 is a lesbian\" clip. NOW Mike is REALLY interested because he always considered R2D2 to be straight or maybe bi. \n\nAll this madness stems from one thing tearing us all apart: Politics. Specifically identity politics. This show has become the figurative rope in a tug-of-war match between people that don’t want certain things in their Star War and people that do. Mike and Rich really don’t give two shits. They wanted to step back and look at this whole circus (note to editor: find more circus music) and comment on why it is happening now and what we all can do to prepare for the future (invest in canned foods and shotguns). We harbor no ill will towards anyone on the internet whose content we’ve referenced. From those that produce content complaining about The Acolyte and those that defend it. Everyone has a right to their ppinion and free speech on this topic and that includes us. We wanted to look at this whole situation, analyze it, discuss how we got here and possibly offer solutions. This world has become an unbearable nightmare and I want my ashes shot into a black hole. Part of me hopes that a huge solar flare from the sun reaches Earth and knocks out everything that runs on electricity. Then we can all then stop and listen to the sounds of nature. Get off social media for a while. See the beauty of this world we all share together... and then think about how outrageous it is that they called R2D2 a lesbian!!!!!!",

If you’re eliminated you’ll have the chance to rift back into gameplay over the course of the match until the reboot timer expires. Either your entire squad is wiped and it’s onto the next match or you find yourself at the top taking out all rifted, rebooted, and reloaded enemies to claim a Victory Royale. \n\nSquaddies reboot in Fortnite Reload, so long as one member of the team remains.  Reload is a 40-player Squads experience on a tighter map featuring familiar locations like Tilted Towers and Retail Row. The Storm is closing in… fast! And so are your opponents.

                "description": "Rift, Reboot, Reload in Fortnite’s newest game mode: Fortnite Reload - fn.gg/Reload\n\nFortnite Reload is a fast-paced, high-action game that is all about carrying the squad to Victory. If you’re eliminated you’ll have the chance to rift back into gameplay over the course of the match until the reboot timer expires. Either your entire squad is wiped and it’s onto the next match or you find yourself at the top taking out all rifted, rebooted, and reloaded enemies to claim a Victory Royale. \n\nSquaddies reboot in Fortnite Reload, so long as one member of the team remains.  Reload is a 40-player Squads experience on a tighter map featuring familiar locations like Tilted Towers and Retail Row. The Storm is closing in… fast! And so are your opponents. A full team wipe means Game Over! Whether you choose build or Zero Build, the last squad standing wins.\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fortnite/​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FortniteGame​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FortniteGame/​\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Fortnite\n\nLearn More: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home"

Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a ¼ sheet pan. Line the bottom and two longer sides with a piece of parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles. Melt chocolate and butter in a large bowl set over a double boiler, stirring often with a flexible heat-proof spatula.

Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a ¼ sheet pan. Line the bottom and two longer sides with a piece of parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles. Melt chocolate and butter in a large bowl set over a double boiler, stirring often with a flexible heat-proof spatula. Remove from the heat and add the sugar, yolks, salt, and vanilla and whisk vigorously. Add the flour and fold thoroughly with the spatula until you have a homogenous dough. Spread into the prepared pan with an offset spatula in a smooth, even layer. Bake in a water bath until the brownies are set, 18 to 22 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely."
