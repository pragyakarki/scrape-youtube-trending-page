Now, she finds herself once again in the waiting room of Brighter Days Inc., but this time for a very different appointment. The company now offers advanced memory restoration, allowing her to revisit a curated selection of moments from her life—both cherished and painful. As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today. She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma. In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there’s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\n \nSet against the music of eternal sunshine deluxe: brighter days ahead, and directed by frequent collaborators Christian Breslauer and Ariana Grande, this film explores love, loss, growth, and the fleeting nature of memory, delivering a heartfelt cinematic experience that closes the door on this eternal sunshine album era.\n\n►Subscribe to Ariana Grande: http://ArianaGrande.lnk.to/subscribe\n \n►Follow Ariana Grande\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/arianagrande/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/arianagrande \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@arianagrande\nWebsite: https://www.arianagrande.com/ \n \n#arianagrande #brighterdaysahead #eternalsunshine\n\n\nMusic video by Ariana Grande performing brighter days ahead.© 2025 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.",

Antes, Mbappé había adelantado a los de Ancelotti al convertir un penalti a lo Panenka. Había que dar la vuelta al marcador tras el paso por los vestuarios y nada más salir llegó el empate. Bellingham, sin apenas espacio, se sacó en el 47’ un disparo dentro del área que obtuvo como respuesta una gran estirada de Dmitrovic. El rechazo llegó a Brahim y su remate fue repelido por Tapia sobre la línea de gol, pero el balón golpeó en el larguero y Bellingham apareció para llevarlo a la red con un remate acrobático. Transcurrían los minutos y en el 76’ llegó el merecido premio del tercer gol. Lo firmó Mbappé en un magistral libre indirecto desde la frontal del área. Segundo doblete consecutivo del galo. De ahí hasta el final, los de Ancelotti supieron mantener la renta obtenida y sumar los tres puntos. \n#RealMadridLeganés | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT"

Like what happens after Wendy falls? Did she die? What does Peter do? Fairies are still dying so like, thats still a problem. \n\nI had lots of fun with this one as you can probably tell! I wanted it to feel stylistically the same as the previous song with some new ideas and with a good finish to the story so that Tinks story could have a nice sharp full stop so that’s what we’ve attempted to do here. I hope you love it as much as we loved making it!!\n\nHUGE thank you to all the incredible people that helped this project some to life!! I’ll be crediting them all below this \nstory so do go check out their work! \n\nVILLAIN STORY \n\nWendy is dead. Finally Tink and her friends were safe again, but was that a step too far? Tinkerbell had no other choice right? If she’d let Wendy live then Peter Pan would’ve left Neverland, left Tinkerbell and stopped believing in fairies. Tinks very existence had rested on a knife edge. So Wendy had to go. \n\nThe first laugh of a newborn baby is what brings fairies into existence and, as Tink previously discovered, it is that same child that stops believing that then ends the same fairies life. Tink and her friends had found the children they were connected to, Peter Pan and the Lost boys. And Wendy and her brothers had almost taken them away until she’d intervened. Now Tink and her friends were safe it was their responsibility to help the whole of Pixie Hollow. Fairies were still dying out, the other inhabitants were fading at an alarming rate.\n\nTo ensure their people’s continued existence Tink and her friends would have to do something bigger, something drastic to ensure humans never stopped believing in fairies.\n\nLuckily Tink has been experimenting with Pixie Dust, searching for a way to bring fairies back from the dead. Sadly, she never did find a way to revive fawn and Silvermist. But she did happen upon a way to enhance their powers, weaponise them, to create an army charged with Pixie Dust. Tinkerbell knew that much power in one fairies hands was wrong, but with the crisis she was facing she didn’t have a choice. \n\nNow with almost limitless power at her fingertips, Tink and her friends finally had a solution to their problem. But she has another foe to face first. Peter Pan won’t sit idly by after the death of Wendy. Tink crossed a line she may well regret crossing very soon…\n\n\nByyyeeeee\n\nPS.

In true Wicked Makers fashion, we didn’t stop at scary… we cranked it up to horrifying. Using steel, pneumatics, and a whole lot of trial and error, we created a terrifying DIY Halloween animatronic and then tested its bite strength with a ballistic gel arm to see if Yarnaby could really take a chunk out of someone. Spoiler: it got messy. If you're into DIY Halloween props, animatronic builds, or just love ridiculous horror props, you're going to love this chaotic creation.\n\nThis video is packed with behind-the-scenes madness, prop-making tips, and a full breakdown of how we built Yarnaby from scratch. Whether you're making your own haunted house props, dreaming up Halloween decor, or just love creepy DIY animatronics, this is the ultimate Poppy Playtime build for the spooky season. And if you love mascot horror, we’ve got a ton more custom animatronics from FNAF, Poppy Playtime, and even The Walten Files on our channel. Subscribe for more Wicked DIY horror projects and join Jay and Jaimie as we test the limits of what a homemade Halloween animatronic can actually do.

Authorities in the Thai capital have already received 169 calls about building damage.\n\nA British holidaymaker described how window panes started “popping out of the side” of the building next to his hotel as the earthquake hit Bangkok.\n\n“We were out by the pool on the 11th floor at the Rembrandt Hotel and my girlfriend asked me if the floor was moving when she was lying on the bed. And then suddenly I realised it was also moving,” Kurt Bull, from Norwich, said.\n\nHe is spending ten days on holiday in Thailand with his Swedish partner, Sigrid.\n\n“Then the building beside the Rembrandt started moving a lot and was really creaking,” he said. “You could hear cracking of the structure, and the smaller glass windows were popping out at the side of the building.\n\n“When we went to leave the pool area, all of the tiles and some of the roof in the stairwell had come down and smashed all over the floor, and I had no shoes with me so I was barefoot, so I didn’t want to go through the tower.”\n\nRead the best of our journalism: https://www.thetimes.com/\nSubscribe to The Times and The Sunday Times YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=timesonlinevideo\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/timesandsundaytimes/\nFind us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thetimes\nFind us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thetimes/\n\n#thailand #warthquake #bangkok",

And then suddenly I realised it was also moving,” Kurt Bull, from Norwich, said.\n\nHe is spending ten days on holiday in Thailand with his Swedish partner, Sigrid.\n\n“Then the building beside the Rembrandt started moving a lot and was really creaking,” he said. “You could hear cracking of the structure, and the smaller glass windows were popping out at the side of the building.\n\n“When we went to leave the pool area, all of the tiles and some of the roof in the stairwell had come down and smashed all over the floor, and I had no shoes with me so I was barefoot, so I didn’t want to go through the tower.”\n\nRead the best of our journalism: https://www.thetimes.com/\nSubscribe to The Times and The Sunday Times YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=timesonlinevideo\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/timesandsundaytimes/\nFind us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thetimes\nFind us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thetimes/\n\n#thailand #warthquake #bangkok"

            "description": "In Part 2 of our sit-down with Drake Bell, we pick up right where we left off—unpacking everything that came after the show ended. From personal regrets to private reconciliations, we reflect on the years apart, the moments that shaped us, and how we finally found our way back to friendship.\n\nWe talk openly about what drove us apart and what’s bringing us back together. Drake shares unbelievable stories—playing a private concert in Switzerland for eight kids, becoming a children’s menu icon in Mexico, and his surreal trip to Brunei with Pamela Anderson. But he also opens up about the real stuff: going to rehab, becoming a father, learning to survive—and then choosing to live fully.\n\nWe revisit our shared past with fresh perspective and a whole lot more grace. It’s funny, it’s heartbreaking, it’s hopeful—and it’s the closure we didn’t know we needed.\n\nWe love this episode. We love Drake.

The unpredictable situations will test even the strongest competitor, as food is scarce, rewards and supplies are minimal, and the mental and physical challenges force players to make impossible decisions and adjust their strategies, while still navigating the complex social game. The individuals competing are from diverse backgrounds and bring a fresh perspective to this new era of the game, but the goal remains the same: to outwit, outplay and outlast, and in the end, only one will remain to claim the title of Sole Survivor and win the $1 million prize.

            "description": "'The Bachelor' star Grant Ellis opens up about the moment he knew Juliana Pasquarosa was the one. He recalls their instant connection from the first moment he saw her, saying, “Her personality drew me in.” Juliana shares her first impression of Grant, admitting, “He calmed my nerves more than I thought he would, and he’s a lot taller and a lot more handsome in person.” The couple reflects on their trip to Edinburgh, Scotland, where they truly bonded, and Juliana talks about how everything seemed to fall into place, from her sister signing her up for 'The Bachelor' to discovering that Grant — her top choice — was the lead. “I had no doubts. I think I knew from night one that you were my man,” she says.\n\nGrant and Juliana also discuss their engagement on 'The Bachelor' finale and the stunning emerald-cut diamond ring with a gold band that Grant chose for her. Juliana’s verdict? “He hit the nail on the head,” she says. The couple shares an update on their future together, with Juliana revealing their next steps: “[Grant’s] going to come out to Boston, and we’ll take a peek at some apartments and see what our vibe is like and where we want to be.” As for their wedding plans? Juliana confirms, “It’s definitely going to be in Italy!” For now, they’re enjoying the excitement of their new chapter together: “We want to live life together for a minute.”\n\nSubscribe to People ►► http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.

This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, 3D cameras, and a VR headset. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. GeorgeNotFound, Sapnap and I are on a team of 3, and are trying to speedrun and beat the game before we die to the titan.\n\nIf someone dies, they cannot respawn. If I die, the challenge is over. The titan's compass points to me at all times.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. \n\nIf this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll make my next video another one :)\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.
