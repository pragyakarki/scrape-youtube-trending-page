New trailer out now!\n--\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@minions\nFacebook:  https://uni.pictures/MinionsFB\nX: https://uni.pictures/MinionsTW\nInstagram:  https://uni.pictures/MinionsIG\nOfficial Site:  https://despicable.me\n--\nIn the first Despicable Me movie in seven years, Gru, the world’s favorite supervillain-turned-Anti-Villain League-agent, returns for an exciting, bold new era of Minions mayhem in Illumination’s Despicable Me 4. \n\nFollowing the 2022 summer blockbuster phenomenon of Illumination’s Minions: The Rise of Gru, which earned almost $1 billion worldwide, the biggest global animated franchise in history now begins a new chapter as Gru (Oscar® nominee Steve Carrell) and Lucy (Oscar® nominee Kristen Wiig) and their girls —Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Madison Polan)—welcome a new member to the Gru family, Gru Jr., who is intent on tormenting his dad.\n\nGru faces a new nemesis in Maxime Le Mal (Emmy winner Will Ferrell) and his femme fatale girlfriend Valentina (Emmy nominee Sofia Vergara), and the family is forced to go on the run.  \n\nThe film features fresh new characters voiced by Joey King (Bullet Train), Emmy winner Stephen Colbert (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert) and Chloe Fineman (Saturday Night Live). Pierre Coffin returns as the iconic voice of the Minions and Oscar® nominee Steve Coogan returns as Silas Ramsbottom. \n\nPacked with non-stop action and filled with Illumination’s signature subversive humor, Despicable Me 4 is directed by a co-creator of the Minions, Oscar® nominee Chris Renaud (Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets), and is produced by Illumination’s visionary founder and CEO Chris Meledandri and by Brett Hoffman (executive producer, The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Minions: The Rise of Gru). The film is co-directed by Patrick Delage (animation director Sing 2 and The Secret Life of Pets 2), and the screenplay is by the Emmy winning creator of White Lotus, Mike White, and the veteran writer of every Despicable Me film, Ken Daurio.",

            "description": "Pound-for-pound great Canelo Álvarez turned in a vintage performance by dropping the previously unbeaten Jaime Munguia Saturday night on his way to earning a unanimous decision as Canelo Promotions presented the all-Mexican clash headlining a PBC Pay-Per-View event on Prime Video from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nMaking the fourth defense of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO 168-pound world titles, Canelo delivered another Cinco de Mayo weekend masterpiece as he took home the decision by scores of 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112. Munguia fought valiantly and was extremely busy in the ring, but Canelo consistently landed the cleaner shots across the 12 rounds.\n \n“This win means a lot,” said Canelo. “I’m glad that I gave him this opportunity. Munguia is a great guy and a great champion. He’s gonna have a great career. I’m very proud that the whole world is watching us Mexicans.”\n \n\"I came out strong and was winning the early rounds,” said Munguia. “I let my hands go, but he’s a fighter with a lot of experience. The loss hurts because it's my first loss and I felt strong.”\n \nMunguia appeared to have the momentum after he closed round three with a right hand that appeared to snap Canelo’s head back. However, Canelo responded like the future Hall of Famer he is and delivered the highlight of the fight in round four with a left hook-uppercut that put Munguia on the mat.\n \n“I took my time,” said Canelo. “I have a lot of experience. Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong and smart. But I have 12 rounds to win the fight and I did. I did really good and I’m proud of it. He’s strong, but he’s a little slow. I could see every punch. That’s why I’m the best.”\n \n\"There’s no doubt I would have beaten anyone else tonight,” said Munguia. “He has a lot of experience. I started well, but he’s a fighter who creates a lot of problems.\"\n \nCanelo rode the momentum from that moment to dominate the final eight rounds on the way to his unanimous decision. While Munguia threw more punches than Canelo according to CompuBox (663-536), it was Canelo who held the edge in shots landed (234-170) and connect rate (44% to 26%).\n \nAfter sweeping the final three rounds on all of the cards, Canelo discussed his place in boxing history and his plans for what comes next.\n \n“When I retire, my numbers will say what position I'm in,” said Canelo. “I know there's a lot of great Mexican fighters in the past, but I’m the best fighting right now. I’m gonna rest and enjoy my family. If the money is right, I can fight right now. I’ve fought everyone and I can do what I want.\"\n\n#CaneloMunguia #Canelo #JaimeMunguia \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

For Remy, it’s through food and cooking, and they talk about how everyone has their own medium of art. Alan talks about the art of filmmaking, both from his perspective and genius director Brad Bird. Jonathan explains how finding your passion is foundational to loving and accepting yourself. And they come up with some wild theories about Remy’s psychosis.\n\nSupport us!\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/CinemaTherapy\nMerch: https://store.dftba.com/collections/cinema-therapy\nInternet Dads Popcorn: http://ctpopcorn.com\n\nCinema Therapy is:\nWritten by: Megan Seawright, Jonathan Decker, and Alan Seawright\nProduced by: Jonathan Decker, Megan Seawright, Alan Seawright, and Corinne Demyanovich\nEdited by: Nathan Judd\nDirector of Photography: Bradley Olsen\nEnglish Transcription by: Anna Preis\n\nConnect with us!\nWebsite: https://www.thecinematherapy.com\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/NmbFhr8tfu\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/therapy_cinema\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@therapy_cinema\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@therapy_cinema\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/therapy_cinema\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/therapycinema"

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #afterhours",

Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #afterhours"

            "description": "During the three-part reunion, Andy Cohen and the Vanderpump Rules cast give their real-time reactions to the final moments of Season 11. Watch Vanderpump Rules Tuesdays at 8/7c on Bravo and streaming next day on Peacock.\n\n►► SUBSCRIBE: http://bravo.ly/Subscribe\n►► WATCH FULL EPISODES NOW: https://bravo.app.link/Bravo-YT\n►► VISIT BRAVO’S OFFICIAL SITE: http://bravo.ly/Official\n#Bravo #PumpRules #Reunion #TomSandoval #ArianaMadix\n\nAbout Vanderpump Rules:\nAs a mentor and confidant to the group, Lisa is working to restore some peace between two feuding exes as she attempts to provide perspective. Lisa is refocusing her expertise on opening a new restaurant in Lake Tahoe and continuing her success with additional ventures in Las Vegas.   \n\nAriana’s life was turned upside down after a devastating breakup, but she’s determined to make the best of a difficult situation. Although she still shares a home with her ex, Ariana is moving on and dating a new long-distance boyfriend. While working to open the doors to her and Katie’s sandwich shop, Something About Her, Ariana is embracing the countless opportunities that have come her way.\n  \nRecently proclaimed #1 guy in the group, James’ friendships within the circle are stronger than ever and his DJ career is booming. He bought a house in the Valley and is settling into suburban life with his girlfriend, Ally Lewber, along with their cat and a dog from James’ past.\n  \nWith more distance from her divorce, Katie is exploring life as a single woman and dating, even if her pursuits strike too close to home for her ex-husband, Tom. A previous indiscretion comes to light and threatens to upend her and Scheana’s renewed friendship as well as her cordial post-divorce relationship with Tom.\n  \nLala is still in the midst of a challenging custody battle, but being the best mom to Ocean remains her priority. Lala explores fertility treatments and looks for a sperm donor as a single mother. She finds an unlikely connection with Tom Schwartz, forming a friendship that neither saw coming, but creating tension between her and the rest of the girls as her forgiveness for the Toms grows.\n  \nCelebrating their one-year wedding anniversary, Scheana and husband Brock are struggling to connect as they leave the honeymoon stage and settle into their life with a toddler. Scheana works on new music as a way to express herself. She finds herself straddling the lines in the sand within the group as she navigates her relationships with her longtime friends, and feuding exes, Ariana and Tom.\n  \nIn the aftermath of a scandal that changed his romantic relationships, dynamics within the group and the success of his businesses, Sandoval is working on bettering himself. In a fragile state, he focuses on repairing the foundations of his friendships. When he isn’t on the road touring with his band, Tom Sandoval and the Most Extras, he and Ariana live under the same roof ... locked in a stalemate for the house.\n  \nTom is mending a challenged friendship after taking the heat for his part in his best friend’s shocking deception. Embracing a new identity, Tom bleaches his hair, evades exclusivity with a friend-potentially-turned-girlfriend, and winds up in a surprising love triangle with a new flame and his ex-wife.\n\nCast:\nLisa Vanderpump\nAriana Madix\nJames Kennedy\nKatie Maloney\nLala Kent\nScheana Shay\nTom Schwartz\nTom Sandoval\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

                "title": "SNEAK PEEK: Your First Look at the Vanderpump Rules Season 11 Reunion! | Vanderpump Rules | Bravo",
                "description": "During the three-part reunion, Andy Cohen and the Vanderpump Rules cast give their real-time reactions to the final moments of Season 11. Watch Vanderpump Rules Tuesdays at 8/7c on Bravo and streaming next day on Peacock.\n\n►► SUBSCRIBE: http://bravo.ly/Subscribe\n►► WATCH FULL EPISODES NOW: https://bravo.app.link/Bravo-YT\n►► VISIT BRAVO’S OFFICIAL SITE: http://bravo.ly/Official\n#Bravo #PumpRules #Reunion #TomSandoval #ArianaMadix\n\nAbout Vanderpump Rules:\nAs a mentor and confidant to the group, Lisa is working to restore some peace between two feuding exes as she attempts to provide perspective. Lisa is refocusing her expertise on opening a new restaurant in Lake Tahoe and continuing her success with additional ventures in Las Vegas.   \n\nAriana’s life was turned upside down after a devastating breakup, but she’s determined to make the best of a difficult situation. Although she still shares a home with her ex, Ariana is moving on and dating a new long-distance boyfriend. While working to open the doors to her and Katie’s sandwich shop, Something About Her, Ariana is embracing the countless opportunities that have come her way.\n  \nRecently proclaimed #1 guy in the group, James’ friendships within the circle are stronger than ever and his DJ career is booming. He bought a house in the Valley and is settling into suburban life with his girlfriend, Ally Lewber, along with their cat and a dog from James’ past.\n  \nWith more distance from her divorce, Katie is exploring life as a single woman and dating, even if her pursuits strike too close to home for her ex-husband, Tom. A previous indiscretion comes to light and threatens to upend her and Scheana’s renewed friendship as well as her cordial post-divorce relationship with Tom.\n  \nLala is still in the midst of a challenging custody battle, but being the best mom to Ocean remains her priority. Lala explores fertility treatments and looks for a sperm donor as a single mother. She finds an unlikely connection with Tom Schwartz, forming a friendship that neither saw coming, but creating tension between her and the rest of the girls as her forgiveness for the Toms grows.\n  \nCelebrating their one-year wedding anniversary, Scheana and husband Brock are struggling to connect as they leave the honeymoon stage and settle into their life with a toddler. Scheana works on new music as a way to express herself. She finds herself straddling the lines in the sand within the group as she navigates her relationships with her longtime friends, and feuding exes, Ariana and Tom.\n  \nIn the aftermath of a scandal that changed his romantic relationships, dynamics within the group and the success of his businesses, Sandoval is working on bettering himself. In a fragile state, he focuses on repairing the foundations of his friendships. When he isn’t on the road touring with his band, Tom Sandoval and the Most Extras, he and Ariana live under the same roof ... locked in a stalemate for the house.\n  \nTom is mending a challenged friendship after taking the heat for his part in his best friend’s shocking deception. Embracing a new identity, Tom bleaches his hair, evades exclusivity with a friend-potentially-turned-girlfriend, and winds up in a surprising love triangle with a new flame and his ex-wife.\n\nCast:\nLisa Vanderpump\nAriana Madix\nJames Kennedy\nKatie Maloney\nLala Kent\nScheana Shay\nTom Schwartz\nTom Sandoval\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

                "description": "My giant cloud rainforest ecosystem vivarium, Pantdora, has been a dream tank. Its unique plethora of flora and fauna, all connected via the food web, and lead to some amazing insights into the workings of Mother Nature! But the time has come to create a second ecosystem vivarium, an attachment to Pantdora, as an extension to the biological world we created. In this episode, I travel to the biodiverse island of Borneo and Australia to explore different biomes, and decide on what animals, plants, and fungi, I might be able to house in our next world. Hope you enjoy this Episode 5, Season 2 of my ecosystem vivarium series. Ant love forever!

It's going to be quite a journey...  \n\nAs Bethesda have just released starfield that has been a relatively bug free game excluding all of the exploits I felt it was important to go back in time and see if we can compare the release build of Fallout 4 to a starfield review of sorts. Now as Todd Howard would never lie and every one of his games have the it just works seal of gameplay approval it is impossible for us to have a non perfectly balanced experience!

Remember my secret gaming room to hide from my mom, my sister, and my dad? Well, I've leveled up since then. I've become so good at building hidden gaming rooms that I decided to create one with a twist—a hidden doomsday bunker in the wild! To really test my skills, I threw in a new challenge: I have a bounty hunter on my trail, trying to find me in my new hidden bunker. It's the ultimate game: to prove how well I can blend in and stay undetected. Building this public doomsday bunker was insane, intense, and absolutely incredible. It took all my team’s wit, creativity, and a bit of stealth gaming magic. I've had a blast putting this together and can't wait for you to see how it all went down. From dodging curious onlookers to setting up the perfect  setup in my hidden bunker, it's been an adventure like no other.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a hidden doomsday bunker!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Backyard Underground Bunker Tour/Update 5 years on, But Hidden Bed Entrance to EPIC Bunker, But We Explored the World’s Largest Doomsday Community (575 underground bunkers), But I Built a SECRET Survival Bunker, But Texan maker's underground survival bunkers are real batcaves, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But Surviving inside Tiny vs GIANT Underground Bunkers, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But $1 vs $1,000,000 Secret Gaming Base, But I Survived 50 Hours In A Nuclear Bunker, But Surviving Overnight in $60 Million Doomsday Bunker, But DIY Container Bunker Construction: Pro Tips from @AtlasSurvivalShelters, But I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But Uncovering my Underground Bunker after an ENTIRE Year, But I Spent 24 Hours In A Doomsday Bunker, But I Survived a Nuke, or any other video like AllWeDoIsFun, Unspeakable, Airrack, JStu, colinfurze, Ben Azelart, The Container Guy, MrBeast, Dangie Bros, Kirsten Dirksen, Kara and Nate, Chris & Emily, FrenchieFries, or Faze Rug would make.

Remember my secret gaming room to hide from my mom, my sister, and my dad? Well, I've leveled up since then. I've become so good at building hidden gaming rooms that I decided to create one with a twist—a hidden doomsday bunker in the wild! To really test my skills, I threw in a new challenge: I have a bounty hunter on my trail, trying to find me in my new hidden bunker. It's the ultimate game: to prove how well I can blend in and stay undetected. Building this public doomsday bunker was insane, intense, and absolutely incredible. It took all my team’s wit, creativity, and a bit of stealth gaming magic. I've had a blast putting this together and can't wait for you to see how it all went down. From dodging curious onlookers to setting up the perfect  setup in my hidden bunker, it's been an adventure like no other.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a hidden doomsday bunker!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Backyard Underground Bunker Tour/Update 5 years on, But Hidden Bed Entrance to EPIC Bunker, But We Explored the World’s Largest Doomsday Community (575 underground bunkers), But I Built a SECRET Survival Bunker, But Texan maker's underground survival bunkers are real batcaves, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But Surviving inside Tiny vs GIANT Underground Bunkers, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But $1 vs $1,000,000 Secret Gaming Base, But I Survived 50 Hours In A Nuclear Bunker, But Surviving Overnight in $60 Million Doomsday Bunker, But DIY Container Bunker Construction: Pro Tips from @AtlasSurvivalShelters, But I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But Uncovering my Underground Bunker after an ENTIRE Year, But I Spent 24 Hours In A Doomsday Bunker, But I Survived a Nuke, or any other video like AllWeDoIsFun, Unspeakable, Airrack, JStu, colinfurze, Ben Azelart, The Container Guy, MrBeast, Dangie Bros, Kirsten Dirksen, Kara and Nate, Chris & Emily, FrenchieFries, or Faze Rug would make.
