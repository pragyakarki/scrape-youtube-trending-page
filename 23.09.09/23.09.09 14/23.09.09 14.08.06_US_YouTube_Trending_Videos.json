encantas pero no me conviene\nHabla toa esa mierda en las redes pero tu y tu novio saben que yo soy el nene\nYo se que no es lo mismo cuando te vienes, este bicho y esta perla el no la tiene\nYo se que tu me extrañas y yo te extraño aunque no hablamos\nTo el mundo te habla mierda pero yo vuelvo y te gano\nToas tus amigas te dicen que soy un diablo pero tu me conoces soy mas puro que un kilo

es tu cuerpo mas ninguno toco\nLo de nosotros fue fuera de lo normal Tu dime si me equivoco\n\nYo quisiera volver pero es que hice tan poco\nNo me conviene tampoco\nPrefiero morir con el corazon roto (Bis)\n\nSiempre pienso en ti cuando enrolo y prendo un blunt\nRecuerdo tu totito mojao en mi balcon\nMi instinto me decia que tu eres un error\nDe toas mis desiciones tu fuiste la peor\nTu me encantas pero no me conviene\nHabla toa esa mierda en las redes pero tu y tu novio saben que yo soy el nene\nYo se que no es lo mismo cuando te vienes, este bicho y esta perla el no la tiene\nYo se que tu me extrañas y yo te extraño aunque no hablamos\nTo el mundo te habla mierda pero yo vuelvo y te gano\nToas tus amigas te dicen que soy un diablo pero tu me conoces soy mas puro que un kilo de\nPablo\nUo oo oo\nUo oo oo\nUo oo oo oo\nTaba viendo nuestras fotos\nY pensando como los locos\nYo vuelvo y te lambo esos 3 rotos brr\nFreaky\nRompimo una piki\nPor la mitad vete conmigo miti miti\nBaby no sigas jugando conmigo que te la meto como Curry en Golden State City\n\nPensando como los locos\nQue si no es tu cuerpo mas ninguno toco\nLo de nosotros fue fuera de lo normal Tu dime si me equivoco\n\nYo quisiera volver pero es que hice tan poco\nNo me conviene tampoco\nPrefiero morir con el corazon roto\n\nMi vida se inunda y me monto el jetsko\nHasta los papelones baby te los agradezco\nTo estas depresiones se que me las merezco\nPorque siempre estoy pidiendo mucho mas de lo que ofrezco\n\nPero sin ti me enamore de la vida\nLo que sube siempre baja y si le bajo ríete de mi caida\nMe dicen que te han visto con las nuevas amigas\nMas feliz haciendo fila\nQue mentira\n\nMe gradue e' pendejo sin birrete y sin la toga\nAlomejor siempre fuiste la cabra y yo la soga\nEn droga se nos caen los polvos como las hojas\nEse culo se me antoja\nPero no ando en paradojas mami\n\nCorazon roto cámbialo por otro y dile a\nTu amiguita que no likee a mis fotos baby si antes no perdonaba ahora si que toy devoto\nY con algun toto mas rico el golpe boto\n\nYa paso, tu tiempo ya paso\nPues pal carajo\nSi pa ti esto no vale na’\nTu me quieres ver rogar y eso nunca va a pasar\nTe quiero lejos\nYo se que tu las vas a pagar\n\nPensando como los locos\nQue si no es tu cuerpo mas ninguno toco\nLo de nosotros fue fuera de lo normal Tu dime si me equivoco\n\nYo quisiera volver pero es que hice tan poco\nNo me conviene tampoco\nPrefiero morir con el corazon\n\nYo creo que caímos en la rutina\nLa frialdad nos congeló los sentimientos\nY si te sientes sola, yo estoy solo también\nSi tienes roto el cora, yo estoy roto también\nTu lo llamas orgullo pero baby eso es amor propio\nTu estás diciendo que yo tengo gatas de más y a ninguna le copio\nSi nos parchábamos a la F, cuando no tenía nada ni efe.\nSi otras te hablan mierda no te dejes\nYo to’ los días te cantaba y hasta te mostraba mis refes, pero no nos vemos hace meses.\nYo quisiera volver pero eso no nos conviene\nYo que soñaba contigo viendo crecer los nenes\nMi corazón quiere llamarte y mi mente me detiene\nHasta la gente se burla y me ve como un meme\n\nBaby paga el entierro que\nSi no es el culo no lo quiero\nQue puñeta hago ahora los 14 de febrero\nMe tienes depresivo Cancerbero\nLa mente alcohólica\nMoñas exóticas\nTe hiciste un onlyfans y estas erotica\nDe noche con una migraña chronic\nTu me llamas y llego rápido a lo Sonic\nChavos en la fanny pero el corazón empty\nVeo tus fotos y siempre te ves tempting\nSi , te hiciste el cuerpo y ahora te ves racing\nTu aprendiste ingles pues bebe te ves amazing\n\nCuando me vas a contestar\nBaby si me cogen preso algún día aunque sea mándame una postal\nContéstame los voice\nTe dedique una canción de Prince Royce chequea el celular\ntu a mi no me

            "description": "👾 My Discord Server: https://discord.gg/5ZYbXPf\n🔴  Live Channel:  @lukestephenslive \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nStarfield is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was announced during Bethesda's E3 presentation in 2018. The game takes place in a space-themed setting, and is the first new intellectual property developed by Bethesda in 29 years. It is set to release for Windows and Xbox Series X/S on September 6, 2023.\n\nStarfield is an action role-playing video game. Players can switch between a first-person and third-person perspective any time in the game. Starfield features an open world in the form of an area within the Milky Way galaxy, containing both fictional and non-fictional planetary systems, with players being able to land on more than 1,000 planets and an unspecified number of moons and space stations. The majority of the landscapes within the game were procedurally generated; they were subsequently modified and handcrafted content was developed around them. The game will generate the terrain and the alien flora and fauna of a planet depending on the star of its system and its atmosphere, as well as locations of interest as the player approaches a planet. The largest city in the game, New Atlantis, is the largest fictional city Bethesda has developed.

Now, on Friday, October 13, a new chapter begins. From Blumhouse and director David Gordon Green, who shattered the status quo with their resurrection of the Halloween franchise, comes The Exorcist: Believer.  \n\nSince the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar® nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami, Hamilton) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls) on his own. \n\nBut when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia O’Neill), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil. \n\nFor the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar® winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before.\n\nThe film also stars Emmy winner Ann Dowd (The Handmaid’s Tale, Hereditary) as Victor and Angela’s neighbor, and Grammy winner Jennifer Nettles (Harriet, The Righteous Gemstones) and two-time Tony winner Norbert Leo Butz (Fosse/Verdon, Bloodline) as the parents of Katherine, Angela’s friend. \n\nWhen The Exorcist, based on the best-selling book by William Peter Blatty, was released, it changed the culture forever, obliterating box office records and earning 10 Academy Award® nominations, becoming the first horror film ever nominated for Best Picture.  \n\nThe Exorcist: Believer is directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Sattler (Camp X-Ray) and David Gordon Green, from a story by Scott Teems (Halloween Kills), Danny McBride (Halloween trilogy) and David Gordon Green, based on characters created by William Peter Blatty. \n\nThe film is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse and by David Robinson and James G. Robinson for Morgan Creek Entertainment. \n\nThe executive producers are Danny McBride, David Gordon Green, Stephanie Allain, Ryan Turek and Atilla Yücer.

            "description": "Suraya Mohamed | September 5, 2023\nChlöe Bailey and her band were scheduled to fly in the day before this show. But with thousands of flights delayed or canceled at the start of the 4th of July holiday weekend, one member couldn't make it into town. Because the arrangements were designed for two background vocalists, it didn't make sense to have just one and the team decided the ensemble would go without.\n\nBut you would never know something was missing here. Chlöe filled the room with a stunning vocal performance, her positive spirit and light radiated throughout the entire room. The band exuded a special energy too.

                "description": "Suraya Mohamed | September 5, 2023\nChlöe Bailey and her band were scheduled to fly in the day before this show. But with thousands of flights delayed or canceled at the start of the 4th of July holiday weekend, one member couldn't make it into town. Because the arrangements were designed for two background vocalists, it didn't make sense to have just one and the team decided the ensemble would go without.\n\nBut you would never know something was missing here. Chlöe filled the room with a stunning vocal performance, her positive spirit and light radiated throughout the entire room. The band exuded a special energy too. Right from the first note, they locked into a groove that felt really good. \"Surprise,\" a hit from 2022, started out the set with a sexy bump and grind, R&B vibe that segued right into the body-popping \"Body Do.\" Next up was \"I Don't Mind,\" an afrobeat-infused party jam that really demonstrates her wide vocal range.\n\nThe party mood stayed strong with \"Worried,\" another favorite from her 2023 debut album In Pieces.

            "description": "Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances – either side if the interval – and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

                "description": "Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances – either side if the interval – and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

Order yourself a LARQ Swig Top Bottle to go plastic free and enjoy ice cold water throughout the entire day.  https://bylarq.com/undecided3 CODE: MATT10. The growth of solar energy has exploded in the past few years. According to Our World in Data, solar power’s share of global electricity production jumped from 0.15% percent in 2010 to over 4.52% in 2022. This has left even the most optimistic solar energy adoption predictions in the dust. And everyone from skeptical naysayers to the loudest cheerleaders have been taken by surprise. In a 2012 Harvard Business School paper, researchers referred to solar energy as “the most expensive renewable energy.” Compare that to about a decade later where we’re entering solar power’s “terawatt age.” The sun is now widely regarded as the cheapest way to generate electricity.

Today is another episode from my series Thrift Store Makeovers, where I take a used, worn out item (OR sometimes from yard sales or  off of ebay) clean it up, fix it up and decorate it.

I've definitely missed these thrift flips and I want to do more thrifting soon.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Today is another episode from my series Thrift Store Makeovers, where I take a used, worn out item (OR sometimes from yard sales or  off of ebay) clean it up, fix it up and decorate it. I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. I've definitely missed these thrift flips and I want to do more thrifting soon.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up.
