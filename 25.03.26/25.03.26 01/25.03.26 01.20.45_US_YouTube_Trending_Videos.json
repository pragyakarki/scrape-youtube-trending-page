            "description": "'The Bachelor' star Grant Ellis opens up about the moment he knew Juliana Pasquarosa was the one. He recalls their instant connection from the first moment he saw her, saying, “Her personality drew me in.” Juliana shares her first impression of Grant, admitting, “He calmed my nerves more than I thought he would, and he’s a lot taller and a lot more handsome in person.” The couple reflects on their trip to Edinburgh, Scotland, where they truly bonded, and Juliana talks about how everything seemed to fall into place, from her sister signing her up for 'The Bachelor' to discovering that Grant — her top choice — was the lead. “I had no doubts. I think I knew from night one that you were my man,” she says.\n\nGrant and Juliana also discuss their engagement on 'The Bachelor' finale and the stunning emerald-cut diamond ring with a gold band that Grant chose for her. Juliana’s verdict? “He hit the nail on the head,” she says. The couple shares an update on their future together, with Juliana revealing their next steps: “[Grant’s] going to come out to Boston, and we’ll take a peek at some apartments and see what our vibe is like and where we want to be.” As for their wedding plans? Juliana confirms, “It’s definitely going to be in Italy!” For now, they’re enjoying the excitement of their new chapter together: “We want to live life together for a minute.”\n\nSubscribe to People ►► http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.

This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, 3D cameras, and a VR headset. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. GeorgeNotFound, Sapnap and I are on a team of 3, and are trying to speedrun and beat the game before we die to the titan.\n\nIf someone dies, they cannot respawn. If I die, the challenge is over. The titan's compass points to me at all times.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. \n\nIf this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll make my next video another one :)\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.
