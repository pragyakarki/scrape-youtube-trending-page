            "description": "'The Bachelor' star Grant Ellis opens up about the moment he knew Juliana Pasquarosa was the one. He recalls their instant connection from the first moment he saw her, saying, “Her personality drew me in.” Juliana shares her first impression of Grant, admitting, “He calmed my nerves more than I thought he would, and he’s a lot taller and a lot more handsome in person.” The couple reflects on their trip to Edinburgh, Scotland, where they truly bonded, and Juliana talks about how everything seemed to fall into place, from her sister signing her up for 'The Bachelor' to discovering that Grant — her top choice — was the lead. “I had no doubts. I think I knew from night one that you were my man,” she says.\n\nGrant and Juliana also discuss their engagement on 'The Bachelor' finale and the stunning emerald-cut diamond ring with a gold band that Grant chose for her. Juliana’s verdict? “He hit the nail on the head,” she says. The couple shares an update on their future together, with Juliana revealing their next steps: “[Grant’s] going to come out to Boston, and we’ll take a peek at some apartments and see what our vibe is like and where we want to be.” As for their wedding plans? Juliana confirms, “It’s definitely going to be in Italy!” For now, they’re enjoying the excitement of their new chapter together: “We want to live life together for a minute.”\n\nSubscribe to People ►► http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.

                "description": "'The Bachelor' star Grant Ellis opens up about the moment he knew Juliana Pasquarosa was the one. He recalls their instant connection from the first moment he saw her, saying, “Her personality drew me in.” Juliana shares her first impression of Grant, admitting, “He calmed my nerves more than I thought he would, and he’s a lot taller and a lot more handsome in person.” The couple reflects on their trip to Edinburgh, Scotland, where they truly bonded, and Juliana talks about how everything seemed to fall into place, from her sister signing her up for 'The Bachelor' to discovering that Grant — her top choice — was the lead. “I had no doubts. I think I knew from night one that you were my man,” she says.\n\nGrant and Juliana also discuss their engagement on 'The Bachelor' finale and the stunning emerald-cut diamond ring with a gold band that Grant chose for her. Juliana’s verdict? “He hit the nail on the head,” she says. The couple shares an update on their future together, with Juliana revealing their next steps: “[Grant’s] going to come out to Boston, and we’ll take a peek at some apartments and see what our vibe is like and where we want to be.” As for their wedding plans? Juliana confirms, “It’s definitely going to be in Italy!” For now, they’re enjoying the excitement of their new chapter together: “We want to live life together for a minute.”\n\nSubscribe to People ►► http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.

This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, 3D cameras, and a VR headset. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. GeorgeNotFound, Sapnap and I are on a team of 3, and are trying to speedrun and beat the game before we die to the titan.\n\nIf someone dies, they cannot respawn. If I die, the challenge is over. The titan's compass points to me at all times.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 What is Havasupai?\n02:06 winter vs summer here\n09:00 the Secret Village explained\n10:40 Havasu Falls!!\n12:47 our private campsite\n19:27 Mooney falls\n25:06 Beaver falls\n27:28 MDS fail\n29:38 Final thoughts",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 What is Havasupai?\n02:06 winter vs summer here\n09:00 the Secret Village explained\n10:40 Havasu Falls!!\n12:47 our private campsite\n19:27 Mooney falls\n25:06 Beaver falls\n27:28 MDS fail\n29:38 Final thoughts"

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.

The couple also cruise around the city reminiscing on their favorite dates and the early days of their relationship.\n\nPresave I Said I Love You First on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/prerelease/4hecGMYcqKj9t26Kp7CSa9?si=3bcc937912054f3f \n\nListen to Selena Gomez on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0C8ZW7ezQVs4URX5aX7Kqx?si=szh8xI-sRw6Bi5MC3QoHYg \n\nListen to Benny Blanco on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/5CiGnKThu5ctn9pBxv7DGa?si=YvQaF0OtTS6758j9CRuRlg \n\nSpotify Music Studios\nExecutive Producers: Isabelle Homola, Sarah Patellos\nProducers: Ashley Graver, Jana Coffey, Bella Jackson, Sara Madani \nAdditional Editor: Stefano Sanchez\n\nMGX Creative\nDirector: Karam Gill\nExecutive Producers: Karam Gill, Andrew Primavera\nHead of Production: Blase Biello\nHead of Post-Production: Harrison Kunz\nProducer: Maggie Phillips\n1st AD: Constantin Preda\nKey Production Assistant: Andrew Jensen\nProduction Assistants: Kelsey Lorensen, Jake Bergman, Chris Peters\nDirector of Photography: Elijah Guess\nCamera Operators: Steven Wetrich, Onyinyechi Ogomaka, Selena Webb\n1st ACs: Aaron Seller, Carolina Rodriguez\n2nd ACs: Sabrina Mendez, George Arevalo\nStills Photographer: Tracy Nguyen\nDIT: Erin Teevens\nGaffer: Hiram Borges\nBBE: Chris Ginnaven\nKey Grip: Zane Tan\nBBG: Ashley Petrie\nG&E Swing: Justin Schultz \nAudio Mixer: Randall Good\nEditor: Emily Ventura\nPost Production Coordinator: Erin Teevens\nColorist: Greyson Sawyer\nSound Design: Troy Pierce\n\nManagement\nSelena Gomez Management: Aleen Keshishian & Zack Morgenroth\nbenny blanco Management: Andrew Luftman & Ashlyn Banner\n\nLabel\nMichelle An\nRay Kurzeka\nHannah Gold \nForrest Lipton \n\nHair, Makeup, and Styling:\nSelena Gomez Makeup: Hung Vanngo using Rare Beauty\nSelena Gomez Hair: Marissa Marino\nSelena Gomez Styling: Erin Walsh\nbenny blanco Hair and Makeup - Christine Nelli\nbenny blanco Styling - Chloe Badawy"
