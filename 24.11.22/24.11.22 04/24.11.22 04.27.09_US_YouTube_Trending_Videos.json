Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. \n\nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge. \n\nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, blocky wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. \n\nOscar nominee Hess (“Ninety-Five Senses,” “Nacho Libre”) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing. \n\nThe director’s creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (“127 Hours,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “The Meg”), editor James Thomas (“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu”, the “Borat” films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (“The Jungle Book,” “The Batman”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“The Meg,” “What We Do in the Shadows”). Casting is by Rachel Tenner. The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (“Thor: Ragnarok,” the “LEGO®” movies). \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Mojäng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, “A Minecraft Movie.” The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025.",

            "title": "How To Train Your Dragon | Official Teaser Trailer",
            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future.

                "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois.

            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon",

                "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon"

Sorry about that. I was starting to lose steam at the end there. I know my uploading schedule has slowly slowed down. As I’ve come to realize I’m a bit burnt out. I’ve been doing Fool’s Gold for almost 7 years now, STRAIGHT. I’ve only had 2 vacations and now it’s starting to bite me in the butt. I want to keep going but my brain and body need a bit of a break. I will be taking the rest of this year off to try and recharge. Along with in January- Feb, Felix and I are getting married! Meaning I have a lot to do to get that all planned. So expect ep. 37 to be a bit of a wait. I know it can be frustrating, but I do really appreciate all your patience with me and my process. I hope you all still enjoy things! \n\nKickstarter stuff seems to be going well as I see lots of people getting their stuff. Canada, unfortunately was left last for the shipping services, meaning Canadians should start to be getting their rewards in the next two weeks.

Sorry about that. I was starting to lose steam at the end there. I know my uploading schedule has slowly slowed down. As I’ve come to realize I’m a bit burnt out. I’ve been doing Fool’s Gold for almost 7 years now, STRAIGHT. I’ve only had 2 vacations and now it’s starting to bite me in the butt. I want to keep going but my brain and body need a bit of a break. I will be taking the rest of this year off to try and recharge. Along with in January- Feb, Felix and I are getting married! Meaning I have a lot to do to get that all planned. So expect ep. 37 to be a bit of a wait. I know it can be frustrating, but I do really appreciate all your patience with me and my process. I hope you all still enjoy things! \n\nKickstarter stuff seems to be going well as I see lots of people getting their stuff. Canada, unfortunately was left last for the shipping services, meaning Canadians should start to be getting their rewards in the next two weeks.

            "description": "Save up to 50% sitewide for Piloti’s Black Friday Sale from November 21st – December 2nd  https://bit.ly/3OdZRHX\n\nThe 2025 BMW M5 ($135,000 starting in Canada, $119,500 starting in the US) is all new this year and has a lot to prove. Today’s drag race will see it pitted against the ferocious Audi RS7 ($145,150 starting in Canada, $128,600 starting in the US) and the mighty Mercedes-AMG E63 S ($139,000 starting in Canada, $112,800 starting in the US). The new M5 is the horsepower and torque leader of the bunch, but it is also the heaviest by quite a margin. Will its new hybrid tech help propel it to victory? Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race - especially when there is a surprise contender added to the mix! We hope you enjoy the episode. Subscribe!\n\nHuge thanks to Alpha Auto Sales for lending us their E63.

                "description": "Save up to 50% sitewide for Piloti’s Black Friday Sale from November 21st – December 2nd  https://bit.ly/3OdZRHX\n\nThe 2025 BMW M5 ($135,000 starting in Canada, $119,500 starting in the US) is all new this year and has a lot to prove. Today’s drag race will see it pitted against the ferocious Audi RS7 ($145,150 starting in Canada, $128,600 starting in the US) and the mighty Mercedes-AMG E63 S ($139,000 starting in Canada, $112,800 starting in the US). The new M5 is the horsepower and torque leader of the bunch, but it is also the heaviest by quite a margin. Will its new hybrid tech help propel it to victory? Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race - especially when there is a surprise contender added to the mix! We hope you enjoy the episode. Subscribe!\n\nHuge thanks to Alpha Auto Sales for lending us their E63.

            "description": "After only 37 days since the last Starship launch, this afternoon we watched the sixth attempt, and it was very eventful. Due to the fact that this launch is set to be the last time we see a V1 Starship fly, the company made some final alterations to the flight profile and vehicle itself to gather as much data as possible before the switch to V2. \n\nThis included a more aggressive booster catch attempt, a steeper and therefore hotter ship reentry, a raptor relight in space, etc. \n\nFor more space-related content check out - https://thespacebucket.com/\n\nCredit: \nSpaceX - https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:30 - Flight Test 6",

                "description": "Finally we get to see the 2nd reveal of A Minecraft Movie... and it is leaps and bounds ahead of that first trailer. Looking a whole lot less like green screen: the movie, now we can see some actual set design, as well as an additional video of the behind the scenes of the production. The bare minimum of a video game adaptation seems to be met. And with extra effort focusing on other YouTube Minecraft influencers seeing the sights I can't help but get the sense that this enitre 2nd trailer is an apology for the first impressions of the teaser trailer. But will it work out for them come April? I guess we'll just have to see how it turns out. But from here, it very much look like The 2nd Minecraft Movie Trailer Is An Apology...\n\n#dazzreviews #Minecraft #TrendingTrailers #MinecraftMovie #DreamWorks #trailer #MinecraftTrailer #analysis   \n\nMORE VIDEOS:\n►So...

            "description": "A powerful bomb cyclone associated with a major atmospheric river is forecast to drench the West Coast, from Washington to California, this week and could potentially lead to life-threatening flooding and blizzard conditions.\n\nThe term \"bomb cyclone\" comes from the meteorological term \"bombogenesis\" or \"explosive cyclogenesis.\" This happens when a storm system's central pressure drops at least 24 millibars within 24 hours. \n\nThis storm could be of historic strength.

A MINECRAFT MOVIE coming April 4, 2025. Only in theaters.\n \nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. \n \nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge. \n \nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, blocky wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. \n \nOscar nominee Hess (“Ninety-Five Senses,” “Nacho Libre”) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing. \n \nThe director’s creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (“127 Hours,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “The Meg”), editor James Thomas (“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu”, the “Borat” films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (“The Jungle Book,” “The Batman”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“The Meg,” “What We Do in the Shadows”). Casting is by Rachel Tenner. The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (“Thor: Ragnarok,” the “LEGO®” movies). \n \nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Mojäng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, “A Minecraft Movie.” The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025. \n \nCredits not final, subject to change",

Will Indominus 3.0 need to be created? or will 2.0 be enough to face the challenge?\n\nIndom 2.0 Mod here: https://www.nexusmods.com/jurassicworldevolution2/mods/2798\nGet Merch Here: \nhttps://gojicenter.creator-spring.com/\n\n**To clarify** There is absolutely no serious rivalry between GojiCenter and GojiGuy. This is a friendly response to their friendly response to the creation of Indominus 2.0. We at GojiCenter value them as friends of the channel and fellow creators.

Then one day someone decided to make an attempt at killing our Hybrid, and went as far as proclaiming him dead. Today GojiCenter will respond to this challenge and set the matter straight. Will Indominus 3.0 need to be created? or will 2.0 be enough to face the challenge?\n\nIndom 2.0 Mod here: https://www.nexusmods.com/jurassicworldevolution2/mods/2798\nGet Merch Here: \nhttps://gojicenter.creator-spring.com/\n\n**To clarify** There is absolutely no serious rivalry between GojiCenter and GojiGuy. This is a friendly response to their friendly response to the creation of Indominus 2.0. We at GojiCenter value them as friends of the channel and fellow creators. That said, please remember to treat everyone with respect that they deserve, have fun and thank you all for the support! \n\nGojiGuy challenge video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZjbWvYWZY8&t=63s\n\nSpecial thanks to Jack Blackburn - Research Consultant//Script Development"

            "description": "Watch live coverage as SpaceX launches a Falcon 9 rocket with 20 second-generation Starlink internet satellites. Liftoff from pad 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base is scheduled for Sunday, November 17, at 9:53 p.m. PDT (12:53 a.m. EDT, 0553 UTC).
