Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family. He respects and values the morals and traditions of his family and refuses to let the family down.\n\nMeerab’s life takes an unexpected turn when she finds out about her family’s decision regarding her and Murtasim’s life. Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself. On the other hand, Meerab who is used to living her life on her own terms refuses to accept Murtasim’s family traditions and unnecessary social barriers.\n\nSoon their lives go through a series of emotional sufferings and misunderstandings where it becomes difficult for them to coexist. Despite their hatred towards each other, will Meerab and Murtasim accept their true feelings or will the dynamics of ego and self-respect force them to stay apart?\n\nWriter: Nooran Makhdoom\nDirector: Siraj ul Haq\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nYumna Zaidi as Meerab\nWahaj Ali as Murtasim\nBushra Ansari as Salma\nSohail Sameer as Anwar\nSabeena Farooq as Haya\nHira Soomro as Maryam\nFazila Qazi as Aneela\nFarhan Ally Agha as Waqas\nSeemi Pasha as Sabra\nMahmood Aslam as Malik Mukhtaar\nHaris Waheed\nAgha Mustafa\n\n#terebin \n#yumnazaidi \n#wahajali",

Share the News. Spread the word.\n\nTere Bin Episode 21 Teaser - 2nd March 2023 - HAR PAL GEO\n\nMeerab is an ambitious and beautiful young girl who wants to pursue higher studies. Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family. He respects and values the morals and traditions of his family and refuses to let the family down.\n\nMeerab’s life takes an unexpected turn when she finds out about her family’s decision regarding her and Murtasim’s life. Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself. On the other hand, Meerab who is used to living her life on her own terms refuses to accept Murtasim’s family traditions and unnecessary social barriers.\n\nSoon their lives go through a series of emotional sufferings and misunderstandings where it becomes difficult for them to coexist. Despite their hatred towards each other, will Meerab and Murtasim accept their true feelings or will the dynamics of ego and self-respect force them to stay apart?\n\nWriter: Nooran Makhdoom\nDirector: Siraj ul Haq\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nYumna Zaidi as Meerab\nWahaj Ali as Murtasim\nBushra Ansari as Salma\nSohail Sameer as Anwar\nSabeena Farooq as Haya\nHira Soomro as Maryam\nFazila Qazi as Aneela\nFarhan Ally Agha as Waqas\nSeemi Pasha as Sabra\nMahmood Aslam as Malik Mukhtaar\nHaris Waheed\nAgha Mustafa\n\n#terebin \n#yumnazaidi \n#wahajali"

As neighboring countries that share a long and porous border, Pakistan and Afghanistan have a deeply intertwined history that has been marked by conflict, cooperation, and occasional periods of stability.\n\nIn this video, we delve into the key issues that have shaped the relationship between these two countries, from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s to the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s and the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. We also explore the role of regional and international actors in shaping the dynamic between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including India, Iran, China, and the United States.\n\nOur video features interviews with experts and analysts who provide insights into the complex geopolitical and security challenges facing both countries. We also examine the economic and cultural ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the ongoing efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.\n\nWhether you're a student of international relations, a history buff, or simply curious about the complex relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, our video is a must-watch.

            "description": "ज़िंदा है Bani! | Thapki Pyar Ki | थपकी प्यार की | Full Episode | Ep. 639\n\nTina's birthday proves to be a blessing for Thapki as Bani, who looks just like Thapki, turns out to be alive. Will Thapki ever find out that Bani is alive? While Thapki still refuses to accept the fact that Bihaan is dead, Vasundhara urges her to face the reality and move on in her life.\n\nThe bright and beautiful Thapki is pretty much perfect... except for one minor flaw - she stammers. But that doesn't hold her back. All she needs is an encouraging pat on the back,a 'thapki', which soon becomes her name. Over the course of the show, Thapki falls in love with Dhruv, but is duped into getting married to his brother, Bihaan. In spite of this cruel twist of fate, Thapki doesn't let her spirit fade and does all she can to be the ideal bahu. What does destiny hold for this charming girl with an unbeatable spirit?\n\nWatch more videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX18mvVSh-bzmIBfH3sKcKbGZQJ_OGGIg\n\nTo download the Voot app please click on the link: https://voot.onelink.me/eIb4/9b2f5423\n\nTo subscribe to this channel, go to: https://www.youtube.com/c/ColorsRishtey1/featured\n\nFollow us on: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/colorsrishteyindia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rishteytv/\n\n#ColorsRishtey #ThapkiPyarKi #थपकीप्यारकी\n\nThe accuracy, completeness, currency and/or suitability of the above video description is not endorsed by its licensor or broadcaster or the Channel.

                "description": "ज़िंदा है Bani! | Thapki Pyar Ki | थपकी प्यार की | Full Episode | Ep. 639\n\nTina's birthday proves to be a blessing for Thapki as Bani, who looks just like Thapki, turns out to be alive. Will Thapki ever find out that Bani is alive? While Thapki still refuses to accept the fact that Bihaan is dead, Vasundhara urges her to face the reality and move on in her life.\n\nThe bright and beautiful Thapki is pretty much perfect... except for one minor flaw - she stammers. But that doesn't hold her back. All she needs is an encouraging pat on the back,a 'thapki', which soon becomes her name. Over the course of the show, Thapki falls in love with Dhruv, but is duped into getting married to his brother, Bihaan. In spite of this cruel twist of fate, Thapki doesn't let her spirit fade and does all she can to be the ideal bahu. What does destiny hold for this charming girl with an unbeatable spirit?\n\nWatch more videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX18mvVSh-bzmIBfH3sKcKbGZQJ_OGGIg\n\nTo download the Voot app please click on the link: https://voot.onelink.me/eIb4/9b2f5423\n\nTo subscribe to this channel, go to: https://www.youtube.com/c/ColorsRishtey1/featured\n\nFollow us on: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/colorsrishteyindia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rishteytv/\n\n#ColorsRishtey #ThapkiPyarKi #थपकीप्यारकी\n\nThe accuracy, completeness, currency and/or suitability of the above video description is not endorsed by its licensor or broadcaster or the Channel.
