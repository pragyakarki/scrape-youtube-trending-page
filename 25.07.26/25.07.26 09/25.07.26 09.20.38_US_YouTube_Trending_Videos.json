            "description": "We’re not done with you. #FNAF2movie in theaters December 5.\n\n--\n\nThey’re not just at Freddy’s anymore. \n \nIn 2023, Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

wasn’t braced and kissed my face\nWith the scope of my rifle\nI had shot it from a blind as in you’d be blind not to see\nThat there’s a man in the doorway\nOf a mother fucking mansion\nAiming at the feeder where you’d sat to take a feast\nThat’s what I said that’s what I did\nAnd it did not cut one corner\nAs I carved that fat neck mother right down to the bone\nI let him hang for several days\nAnd then I cut off hide and scriffin’\nI cut it thin then throw it in a tupperware to soak\nFried some pieces while I worked\nIt tasted like I made it\nFried in Wagner casted butter in a quiet country place\nWith albums gold and platinum\nOverflowing to the ceiling\nEatin big time is a feelin’ with the friends that I have made\nKeep my time on my Weiss\nYa goddamn right I’m flexing\nCause a thousand dollar watch is fine enough flex for me\nHave you ever got to hold and blow a thousand fucking dollars\nIt runs for 40 hours and then it winds itself to sleep\nIt’s fought for like a bitch and it’s a bitch to keep it goin’\nWhen they ain’t nobody knowin’\nAny prayer you’ve ever sang\nSee me now I’m on the sow\nAnd I’m riding to your city\nEatin big time ain’t she pretty ain’t she witty ain’t she great\nAin’t she great ain’t she grand\nIn my world she’s irreplaceable\nI’m her surfboard in the kitchen\nMy blessings come in waves\nShe’s my rebirth she’s my lemonade\nMy gravy and my biscuits\nMama I’ve been out there huntin’ Imma need you to make a plate\nShe pets my head and whispers “You poor thing you must be famished”\nI just knew that this would happen I got all the fixins made\nI’ll get tick full ‘fore I ever pull myself off of this table\nEatin big time ain’t she pretty just rollin’ in the shade\nEatin big time in the holler ain’t it lovely ain’t it

Players are thrown into a tiny world with almost no rules, except survive as long as possible.\n\nIn Past Life, we will be playing through the older versions of Minecraft and updating to a newer one each episode.\n\n3+ Lives = Green Player\n2 Lives = Yellow Player\n1 Life = Red Player\n\nRed Players are given the goal of killing all the other players in the game.

While Vaani writes, Krish sings and they both make music together. Though poles apart in their lives, beliefs and backgrounds, Vaani and Krish are perfect with each other and for each other. Will they understand that truth despite their age, their problems? \n\nThey say flawed, imperfect people make for a perfect love story…and Saiyaara is about celebrating that one love story that is so deep, so pure and so caring that it is absolutely unconditional.\n\nVaani and Krish will have to navigate life, their problems, their insecurities to hopefully realise that only love can be the answer to everything. Saiyaara is a film that celebrates every season of love through the eyes of Vaani & Krish and poses a simple question…do you love someone so much that you would bet everything to keep that person in your life?\n\n#yrfnewreleases #yrf #yashrajfilms #yrfmovies #yrfmusic #mohitsuri #akshayewidhani #ahaanpanday #aneetpadda #mithoon #arijitsingh #arijitsinghsongs #dhun #dhunsong #newsong #bollywoodsongs #hindiromanticsong #newmusichindi #dhunlyrical\n\n© Yash Raj Films Pvt.

A través de la tecnología, se preserva el legado de Big Boy, acercando su música a nuevas audiencias y manteniendo viva la historia de una canción que marcó época.\n\nLetra l Mis Ojos Lloran Por Ti\n\nEl tiempo pasó…\nComo una estrella fugaz… ✨\nY nuestro amor falleció sin razón… Baby 💔\n\nQuisiera volver\nA aquel tiempo otra vez y poderte detener…\nPues ya no puedo… oh-oh-oh ⏳\n\nSin tu amor… no sé qué vaya a hacer conmigo… 😔\nSin tu amor… no sé cuál sea mi destino…\nSin tu amor… el mundo caerá sobre mí… Baby 🌍💥\n\nQuisiera volver a amarte…\nVolver a quererte…\nVolver a tenerte cerca de mí… Girl 💘\nMis ojos lloran por ti… 😢\nQuisiera volver a amarte…\nVolver a quererte…\nVolver a tenerte cerca de mí… Girl\nMis ojos lloran por ti… 😭\n\nMe haces tanta falta, no lo puedo negar…\nNo sé cómo de mi vida te pudiste marchar…\nArrancaste mi corazón como un trozo de papel…\nJugaste con mi vida y ahora me pregunto: ¿por qué?... 💔\n\n¿Por qué tuve que enamorarme de ti…?\nQuererte como te quise y luego te perdí…\nYo creo que eso no es justo ante los ojos de Dios…\nTe di tanto amor, y tú me pagaste con dolor… 😞\n\nPero algún día tú te darás cuenta de lo que sentía por ti…\nY pensarás en mí, aunque estés lejos de mí…\nAhora sólo me quedan aquellos recuerdos…\nY en mi corazón, una voz que dice: te quiero… 🫶\n\nSin tu amor… no sé qué vaya a hacer conmigo… 😔\nSin tu amor… no sé cuál sea mi destino…\nSin tu amor… el mundo caerá sobre mí… 🌧️\n\nDime si algún día, chica, yo te fallé.\nCometí mis errores, pero jamás te fui infiel…\nNunca me atreví a abandonarte sin pensar\nEn las cosas bonitas que entre nosotros pudieron pasar… 🕯️\n\nTus besos, tus caricias, tu forma de hacer el amor…\nSon cosas que quedaron para siempre en mi corazón…\nY te juro que si algún día yo me vuelvo a enamorar,\nMe aseguraré de que ella tenga tu misma forma de amar… ❤️‍🔥\n\nCréeme, pues mi alma te habla y no te miente.\nMis ojos se acostumbraron a ti solamente…\nY hoy lloran porque tu presencia se disolvió\nEntre el odio, el rencor y la desesperación… 😢\n\nDaría yo mi vida para volver junto a ti…\nY vivir aquellos momentos que me hicieron tan feliz…\nQuisiera volver a amarte, volver a quererte,\nVolver a tenerte cerca de mí… Girl\nMis ojos lloran por ti… 😭\n…lloran por ti…\n\nQuisiera encontrar,\nCaminando en la ciudad,\nAlguien que me diga\nDónde tú estás… Baby 🚶‍♂️🌃\n\nDeseo saber\nCómo es tu vida ahora sin mí…\nY saber si en verdad\nEl amor en ti existe… ❓❤️\n\nQuisiera volver a amarte,\nVolver a quererte,\nVolver a tenerte cerca de mí…\nMis ojos lloran por ti… 🥺\n\nSiento en el alma un vacío tan grande,\nPues tú no te das cuenta de todos los planes que arruinaste…\nVeo las olas del mar, cómo vienen y van,\nY por cada ola que pasa,\nRoba una lágrima más… 🌊\n\nMiro hacia el cielo para ver si encuentro\nLa luz que me ilumine el camino hasta donde estés tú…\nY poder besarte como si fuera la primera vez…\nNaufragar en tu corazón como un triste pez… 🐠💔\n\nQue te ama, te quiere, por ti se enloquece…\nPero qué lástima que las cosas\nNo salen como uno quiere a veces…\nSólo se quedan los momentos en mi mente para siempre…\nTorturan mis sentimientos, pues ya no puedo verte… 😞\n\nMi corazón te extraña y no lo puedo controlar,\nPues contigo fue con quien yo aprendí a amar… 💞\n\nQuisiera volver a amarte, volver a quererte,\nVolver a tenerte cerca de mí…\nMis ojos lloran por ti… 😭\nMis ojos lloran por ti… 😭\n\nSin tu amor… no sé qué vaya a hacer conmigo…\nSin tu amor… no sé cuál sea mi destino…\nSin tu amor… el mundo caerá sobre mí… 🌙\n\n--\nSuscríbete a nuestro canal\n👉🏻  https://musicalatina.tv/jnmusicgroup\n--\nSíguenos:\nhttps://twitter.com/JNMusicgroup\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JNMusicGroup/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jnmusicgroup/\n\nContáctanos: \n☎️ Bookings: +1 (305) 629-8880\n📩 Email: booking@jnrecords.com\n📀 JN Music Group 👈🏼 \n💼 https://jnmusicgroup.com\n--\n#MusicaLatina #Clasicos #VideoMusical\n--\n©️ 2025 - JN Music Group",

Have a great day :)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFollow me on Twitter!\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnstoneYT\n\nFollow me on Twitch!\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/johnstone\n\nFollow my Twitch Highlights Channel!\n@johnstonevods \n\n#johnstone #pokemonchallenge #professoroak \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:00 - Day 1\n13:59 - Day 2\n16:13 - Day 3\n20:42 - Days 4 and 5\n24:53 - Day 6\n31:00 - The Final Grind",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Tickets and meet and greets @ Caskeytour.com \n\n\nLyrics: I HATE EVERYBODY\n\nMoney talks but quiet is how the money sounds\nI’d beat a rapper up again but that’s punching down\nPut on my boots and recognize that it’s funny how\nJellyroll popped and everybody doing country now\nThat ain’t a diss it’s an observation\nIf the shoe fits wear it like your occupation \nPack a bag move to Nashville it’s obligation\nI ain’t a mother fucking star I’m a constellation \nUh\nBlack sheep I don’t follow trends\nI do the opposite put the hollow tips into the hollow end\nMake it Halloween have everyone hollering\nCuz honestly, y’all doing too much dick swallowing\nIt’s bar season I’m bar readyI’m petty as Tom Petty\nI hop out the car with my arm steady\nAnd it’s a workout to walk out the house\nCuz you know what the crown weighs \nAnd not to mention my charm heavy\nThe Glock four pounds\nThe chain is a kilogram\nI leave these peons with black eyes Will I Am\nHe dissed me I guess he was tryna kill a man\nBut his money blew my way \nI guess he still a fan\nFuck with me and you gone find out\nAte him for lunch while he stood at attention \nI guess the nines out\nSo sick of hearing raps coming out your lying mouth\nYou started this so what you crying bout\nI increase the crime rate\nAll of y’all verse me\nI’ll wash every single one of y’all and do the laundry\nMan that’s like Vanilla Ice verses Andre\nIt’s like a hundred little kids verses one Harambe\nBitch please\nYou don’t want none with me\nI’ma change the climate if I turn up one degree\nI should bring back MTV\nOr VH1 \nCuz I clock tea Flavor Flav\nAnd I’m sucker free\nThe goat that’s what I’m paid for\nI did it take one I ain’t make it to take four\nThe crib sitting pretty there off at the lake shore\nI saw Kendrick at the Super Bowl and realized I should hate more\nI hate how every rapper nowadays wanna sound like Yeat\nI hate it when they act mysterious and get on Playboi Carti beats\nAnd think that shit elite \nMan y’all ain’t saying nothing and all that shit is weak \nI’m geeked\nAnd when I say it’s hate I don’t mean it’s tongue and cheek\nI mean your shelf life gone be gone in a week\nI mean that every classic album was saying something\nSo go back to the studio and give that shit a tweak\nI hated it when Drake made it cool to hate on Meek\nCuz he one of the goats when he get onto a streak\nI hated everybody tryna party in L.A. doing coke at Diddy’s house\nTryna turn into a freak\nI hate it when my album drop cuz everybody sleep\nAnd maybe that’s the reason for the anger on this beat\nHate when they say I’ve won\nThey comparing me to rappers \nWho ain’t worth the gum at the bottom of my cleats\nAnd if that struck a nerve go and write a sixteen\nBut when I drop a diss it ain’t gonna be like Drake\nTelling Kendrick that he wifed a mixed queen\nIma’ make em’ kill they self \nKill they whole self esteem\nKill they team\nHave their body stretched like a fucking limousine \nWash their whole mouth out with the listerine \nTurn em’ to a fiend for respect\nCuz he thought that he was up next\nThen he got the guillotine \n\nPussy ass boy\nBitch ass boy\nPussy ass sucker ass fuck ass dumb ass \nBItch ass boy\n\n\n\nFollow:\n▶ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Caskey407\n▶ Instagram: www.instagram.com/caskey"
