            "description": "We’re not done with you. #FNAF2movie in theaters December 5.\n\n--\n\nThey’re not just at Freddy’s anymore. \n \nIn 2023, Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

wasn’t braced and kissed my face\nWith the scope of my rifle\nI had shot it from a blind as in you’d be blind not to see\nThat there’s a man in the doorway\nOf a mother fucking mansion\nAiming at the feeder where you’d sat to take a feast\nThat’s what I said that’s what I did\nAnd it did not cut one corner\nAs I carved that fat neck mother right down to the bone\nI let him hang for several days\nAnd then I cut off hide and scriffin’\nI cut it thin then throw it in a tupperware to soak\nFried some pieces while I worked\nIt tasted like I made it\nFried in Wagner casted butter in a quiet country place\nWith albums gold and platinum\nOverflowing to the ceiling\nEatin big time is a feelin’ with the friends that I have made\nKeep my time on my Weiss\nYa goddamn right I’m flexing\nCause a thousand dollar watch is fine enough flex for me\nHave you ever got to hold and blow a thousand fucking dollars\nIt runs for 40 hours and then it winds itself to sleep\nIt’s fought for like a bitch and it’s a bitch to keep it goin’\nWhen they ain’t nobody knowin’\nAny prayer you’ve ever sang\nSee me now I’m on the sow\nAnd I’m riding to your city\nEatin big time ain’t she pretty ain’t she witty ain’t she great\nAin’t she great ain’t she grand\nIn my world she’s irreplaceable\nI’m her surfboard in the kitchen\nMy blessings come in waves\nShe’s my rebirth she’s my lemonade\nMy gravy and my biscuits\nMama I’ve been out there huntin’ Imma need you to make a plate\nShe pets my head and whispers “You poor thing you must be famished”\nI just knew that this would happen I got all the fixins made\nI’ll get tick full ‘fore I ever pull myself off of this table\nEatin big time ain’t she pretty just rollin’ in the shade\nEatin big time in the holler ain’t it lovely ain’t it

                "description": "#theequalizer4 #denzelwashington #jasonstatham\n\nBekijk deze \"THE EQUALIZER 4 – Fan-Made Concept Trailer\"\n\nTwee legendes. Eén missie. Geen ruimte voor fouten.\nIn deze explosieve, door fans gemaakte concepttrailer brengt The Equalizer 4 Denzel Washington en Jason Statham samen als onwaarschijnlijke bondgenoten in een race tegen de klok om de Derde Wereldoorlog te stoppen. Wanneer een meedogenloos wereldwijd meesterbrein – gespeeld door Giancarlo Esposito – zijn plan in gang zet, moet McCall de krachten bundelen met een dodelijke ex-huurling om de dreiging van binnenuit te ontmantelen.\n\nDit fantasievolle vervolg is rauw, intens en gedreven door morele overwegingen en duikt diep in wereldwijde samenzweringen, brute gevechten en de prijs van rechtvaardigheid in een gebroken wereld.\n\nWaar vrede faalt, spreekt de wraak.\n\nDisclaimer:\nDit is een door fans gemaakte concepttrailer, puur voor entertainmentdoeleinden. Het is een niet-commercieel project zonder banden met Sony Pictures, Antoine Fuqua of een andere officiële Equalizer-productie. Alle rechten op The Equalizer en gerelateerde personages behoren toe aan hun respectievelijke eigenaren.\n\nNaast door fans gemaakte trailers deel ik ook filmrecensies, nieuws en updates uit de entertainmentwereld.

Zero margine di errore.\nIn questo esplosivo concept trailer creato dai fan, The Equalizer 4 riunisce Denzel Washington e Jason Statham come improbabili alleati in una corsa contro il tempo per fermare la Terza Guerra Mondiale. Quando una spietata mente globale, interpretata da Giancarlo Esposito, mette in atto il suo piano, McCall deve unire le forze con un letale ex mercenario per smantellare la minaccia dall'interno.\n\nGrezzo, intenso e alimentato da un ripensamento morale, questo sequel immaginario si immerge in cospirazioni globali, combattimenti brutali e il prezzo della giustizia in un mondo frammentato.\n\nQuando la pace fallisce, la vendetta parla.\n\nAvvertenza:\nQuesto è un concept trailer creato dai fan e creato esclusivamente a scopo di intrattenimento.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Determined to restore Carthage’s glory, he took command of its army at age 26 and led a daring invasion of Italy from Iberia, famously crossing the Alps with his army and 37 war elephants. Hannibal secured major victories at Trebia and Lake Trasimene, with his most famous success at the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C., where he employed a masterful double envelopment to crush a much larger Roman force – a tactic that’s still studied in military strategy today.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\n\nLyric video created by: Bonez Studios \n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.\n\n#Sabaton #Legends #LightningAtTheGates",

Determined to restore Carthage’s glory, he took command of its army at age 26 and led a daring invasion of Italy from Iberia, famously crossing the Alps with his army and 37 war elephants. Hannibal secured major victories at Trebia and Lake Trasimene, with his most famous success at the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C., where he employed a masterful double envelopment to crush a much larger Roman force – a tactic that’s still studied in military strategy today.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\n\nLyric video created by: Bonez Studios \n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.\n\n#Sabaton #Legends #LightningAtTheGates"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\nMusic\n\nBuisness Email: aidanguyen08888@gmail.com",

                "description": "CAS planes have long reigned supreme in War Thunder's top tier ground battles, but that has changed with the addition of vehicles like the german IRIS-T and SLAMRAAM SPAA. The Swedish got the EldE 98, which is the worst top tier SPAA in the game. It has no range, no ammo, and no mobility. Rest assured, it dies to Su-34s and F-15s quite often.\n\nCheck the channel \"About\" section for the link to the creator of my profile picture.\n\nSongs used (in order from first to last):\nHalo OST\nC&C: Generals Soundtrack\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/spookston\n\n#warthundertanks #warthunder​​​​​​​​​​​​ #tanks​​​​​​​​​​​​ #warthundergameplay\nThe WORST Top Tier CAS Killer - Spookston"
