ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

Following a season of historic rivalries, epic comebacks, and unforgettable moments, the world’s top teams now gather at Champions Paris.\n\nFrom September 12 to October 5, the journey continues through Group Stage and Playoffs before the epic conclusion at the Grand Final with the crowning of the next World Champion. The Group Stage will feature 16 teams spread across four groups, with each group hosting one team from VALORANT's four International Leagues. In this stage, teams will battle through a double elimination format, advancing two teams out of each group. The 8 teams who make it out will be randomly seeded into a double elimination bracket, with teams from the same group placed on opposite sides of the bracket. Teams will compete through Best-of-3 matches until the final 2 matches which will be a Best-of-5. The last team standing will claim the title of VALORANT World Champion!\n\nWe’re proud to work with our fantastic partners throughout 2025: AWS, Coinbase, EWC, HyperX, Mastercard, OMEN, Red Bull, Secretlab, and Verizon.\n\nMake sure to follow the official VALORANT Esports social channels for additional information:\nTwitter/X: @valorantesports\nFacebook: /valorantesports\nInstagram: @valorantesports\nTikTok: @valorantesports\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/valorant\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@ValorantEsports\nPhotos from the Event: https://www.flickr.com/photos/valorantesports/\nOfficial VALORANT Esports News: https://valorantesports.com/news\nWeb: https://valorantesports.com\n#VCT #VALORANTChampions",

                "description": "Welcome to the climax of the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour! The biggest stage in VALORANT is ready, the lights of Paris are shining, and the countdown has begun. Following a season of historic rivalries, epic comebacks, and unforgettable moments, the world’s top teams now gather at Champions Paris.\n\nFrom September 12 to October 5, the journey continues through Group Stage and Playoffs before the epic conclusion at the Grand Final with the crowning of the next World Champion. The Group Stage will feature 16 teams spread across four groups, with each group hosting one team from VALORANT's four International Leagues. In this stage, teams will battle through a double elimination format, advancing two teams out of each group. The 8 teams who make it out will be randomly seeded into a double elimination bracket, with teams from the same group placed on opposite sides of the bracket. Teams will compete through Best-of-3 matches until the final 2 matches which will be a Best-of-5. The last team standing will claim the title of VALORANT World Champion!\n\nWe’re proud to work with our fantastic partners throughout 2025: AWS, Coinbase, EWC, HyperX, Mastercard, OMEN, Red Bull, Secretlab, and Verizon.\n\nMake sure to follow the official VALORANT Esports social channels for additional information:\nTwitter/X: @valorantesports\nFacebook: /valorantesports\nInstagram: @valorantesports\nTikTok: @valorantesports\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/valorant\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@ValorantEsports\nPhotos from the Event: https://www.flickr.com/photos/valorantesports/\nOfficial VALORANT Esports News: https://valorantesports.com/news\nWeb: https://valorantesports.com\n#VCT #VALORANTChampions"

Meanwhile, after an emotional family reunion, the MacKenzies needed to decide where and when to settle next, and a haunting cliffhanger left fans questioning the true fate of Claire and Jamie’s first daughter, Faith.\n\nAs Season 8 begins, Jamie and Claire soon find the war has followed them home to Fraser’s Ridge, now a thriving settlement that has grown and flourished in their absence. With new arrivals and changes made during their years away, the Frasers are confronted with the question of what they are willing to sacrifice for the place they call home and, more importantly, what they would sacrifice to stay together. While the Frasers keep a united front against outside intruders, family secrets finally coming to light threaten to tear them apart from the inside. Although they’ve left the war for America’s freedom behind, their fight for Fraser’s Ridge has only just begun."
