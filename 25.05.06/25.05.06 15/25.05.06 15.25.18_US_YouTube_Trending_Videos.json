Follow the trail of destruction and uncover the mysteries of the continent to learn not just how to confront the dragons, but how to overcome them. Prepare potions, craft gear and level yourself up to do battle with the most powerful force on the continent. Make history, or become history. The smart money's on the dragon. But we do love an underdog!\n\n\nChop Trees! Shield yourself with runic energy! Turn bones into... peaches?\n\nJourney through the vast, vibrant regions of Ashenfall and unveil the ruins of forgotten civilisations to discover why wild, transformative magic spills from its fractured lands. Explode ore veins with a snap of your fingers. Conjure a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in an instant. The Anima-rich landscape of Ashenfall offers you a power unlike any other.\n\n\nEmbark on quests, level skills and wield runes to shape the world around you.\n\nExplore a stunning, hand-crafted landscape ravaged by Anima. This all-new adventure blends High Fantasy, light RPG elements, and iconic RuneScape lore into a never-before-seen continent. Venture into a land hidden since time immemorial, uncover ancient secrets, and battle legendary RuneScape creatures alongside entirely new foes like the fearsome Garou. Prepare to face a world filled with mystery, danger, and unforgettable encounters.\n\n\nAs with all RuneScape games, community is at the heart of everything we do.\n\nRuneScape: Dragonwilds is being shaped by player feedback every step of the way, from alpha through to 1.0 and beyond! The expansive continent of Ashenfall remains uncharted, and what lies beyond the veil is still a mystery… for now. Together, we’ll uncover its secrets. Our community will continue to help build and guide our roadmap, a living document that will change and adapt to make this adventure the best it can be. We can't wait!\n\n\nRuneScape: Dragonwilds started Alpha testing in late 2024, and is launching into Early Access in Spring 2025. From here, our humble team of heroes is developing the project with player feedback at the very core.\n\nThis Steam Early Access game is currently not a finished game and may or may not change significantly over the course of development.

Follow the trail of destruction and uncover the mysteries of the continent to learn not just how to confront the dragons, but how to overcome them. Prepare potions, craft gear and level yourself up to do battle with the most powerful force on the continent. Make history, or become history. The smart money's on the dragon. But we do love an underdog!\n\n\nChop Trees! Shield yourself with runic energy! Turn bones into... peaches?\n\nJourney through the vast, vibrant regions of Ashenfall and unveil the ruins of forgotten civilisations to discover why wild, transformative magic spills from its fractured lands. Explode ore veins with a snap of your fingers. Conjure a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in an instant. The Anima-rich landscape of Ashenfall offers you a power unlike any other.\n\n\nEmbark on quests, level skills and wield runes to shape the world around you.\n\nExplore a stunning, hand-crafted landscape ravaged by Anima. This all-new adventure blends High Fantasy, light RPG elements, and iconic RuneScape lore into a never-before-seen continent. Venture into a land hidden since time immemorial, uncover ancient secrets, and battle legendary RuneScape creatures alongside entirely new foes like the fearsome Garou. Prepare to face a world filled with mystery, danger, and unforgettable encounters.\n\n\nAs with all RuneScape games, community is at the heart of everything we do.\n\nRuneScape: Dragonwilds is being shaped by player feedback every step of the way, from alpha through to 1.0 and beyond! The expansive continent of Ashenfall remains uncharted, and what lies beyond the veil is still a mystery… for now. Together, we’ll uncover its secrets. Our community will continue to help build and guide our roadmap, a living document that will change and adapt to make this adventure the best it can be. We can't wait!\n\n\nRuneScape: Dragonwilds started Alpha testing in late 2024, and is launching into Early Access in Spring 2025. From here, our humble team of heroes is developing the project with player feedback at the very core.\n\nThis Steam Early Access game is currently not a finished game and may or may not change significantly over the course of development. To learn more about Steam Early Access, please visit the Steam Early Access FAQs."

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard."

I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.\n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. Peace!\n—\n🎬 *CREDITS:*\nDIRECTOR/HOST » Sonny Side\nCAMERA OPERATOR » Tiep Tran\nEPISODE EDITOR » Ha Nhat Linh\nCOLOR & MASTER » Nguyễn Quang Dũng\nPRODUCER » Terryh Nguyen\nLOCAL GUIDE » Reza (Co-Host) & Hoda (Wife) Kiani https://www.instagram.com/feedkiani https://www.youtube.com/@Feedkiani\n\nSelected tracks via Audio Network 🛆\n*Business Inquiries:*\n✉️ marketing@befrs.com"

Veamos cómo se comparan.\n\nEl Jesko Absolut, que empieza con un V8 biturbo de 5 litros, produce 1600 CV y ​​1500 Nm cuando funciona con E85. La potencia se transmite a las ruedas traseras a través de una caja de cambios multiembrague de 9 velocidades y pesa 1390 kg. Nuevo, cuesta alrededor de 5 millones de libras.\n\nY luego está el Regera. También está propulsado por un V8 biturbo de 5 litros, ¡pero también está equipado con tres motores eléctricos! Al combinarlos con el E85, produce 1500 CV y ​​2000 Nm. La potencia se envía a las ruedas traseras a través de una caja de cambios de convertidor de par de una sola velocidad, y alcanza los 1590 kg. Nuevo, cuesta alrededor de 3 millones de libras.\n\nAsí que el Jesko puede tener un poco más de potencia, ¡pero el Regera tiene tres motores eléctricos! ¿Serán la diferencia? Solo hay una manera de descubrirlo... ¡A CORRER!\n\nSuscríbete a @Carwow-Drags\n\nCambia tu coche con Carwow: https://bit.ly/Change-Your-Car-0305\n\nChiron Super Sport vs. Jesko Attack: https://bit.ly/Chiron-SS-v-Jesko-Attack-0305"

The music stands alone on a foundation anchored by his impressive sonic proficiency (across drums, bass, keys, and guitar) and airtight arena-size hooks with unforgettable vocals. He harbors an irresistible signature sound, inventive vision, and incomparable identity vaunted by a fervent global fanbase. For as unique as the music is, his story so far proves to be just as unprecedented. This is arguably the first hard rock act to genuinely break out from ground zero in the 2020’s, generating north of 100 million streams, toppling charts, and selling out headline tours less than five years since its debut. Back in 2021, Mammoth’s first offering, Mammoth WVH, took flight, bowing at #12 on the Billboard 200 and capturing #1 on three Billboard charts—Top Hard Rock Albums, Top Independent Albums, and Top Rock Albums. “Distance” soared as the first of two #1 Rock Radio Hits and earned a GRAMMY® Award nomination for “Best Rock Song.” Two years later, Mammoth II only saw him pick up the pace. It debuted in the Top 5 of the Billboard Top Album Sales Chart in addition to bringing him back to #1 on the Top Hard Rock Albums Chart. It incited widespread applause from Rolling Stone, Guitar World, GRAMMY.com, Classic Rock, American Songwriter, and KERRANG! The band canvased the globe with Metallica and Pantera and supported Foo Fighters in North America as well as filling houses on their own. They performed on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!, at MusiCares 2024 gala in honor of Jon Bon Jovi, and Wolf took the stage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame® Induction of Ozzy Osbourne. Now, Wolfgang pushes forward on Mammoth’s third full-length LP.\n\nConnect with Mammoth at:\nWebsite: www.mammoth.band\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MammothWVH\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mammothwvh/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MammothWVH\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@MammothWVH \n\nLyrics:\nWake up\nOpen up your tired eyes\nIt’s way down\nBurning up inside\n\nFade out\nAll of the surrounding noise and\nStand tall\nNow is not the time for burning out\n\nBreak me out of this\nHere we are ignoring it\nTake your hand in mine and \nWatch the end with me\n\nNo love\nBleeding out and bleeding over\nNo trust\nWho are you to me?\n\nToo loud\nBlind to all the ins and outs\nYou’re too proud\nHow?

                "title": "Mammoth: The End (Official Video)",
                "description": "Mammoth - The End (Official Video)\n\nDirected By: Robert Rodriguez & Greg Nicotero\n\nWritten by: Wolfgang Van Halen & Robert Rodriguez\n\nStarring: Danny Trejo, Wolf and Andraia Van Halen, Garrett Whitlock, Jon Jourdan, Ronnie Ficarro, Frank Sidoris, Valerie Bertinelli, Rogue Rodriguez, Rhiannon Rodriguez, Myles & Selena Kennedy and Slash.\n\nCheck out The End here: https://Mammoth.lnk.to/TheEndID\n\nCheck out The End Tour here: https://mammoth.os.fan\nOct 31 – Show information to come soon\nNov 1 – Las Vegas, NV – House of Blues\nNov 4 – Dallas, TX – House of Blues\nNov 5 – Houston, TX – House of Blues\nNov 7 – Lake Buena Vista, FL – House of Blues\nNov 8 – Atlanta, GA – Tabernacle \nNov 9 – Charlotte, NC – The Fillmore\nNov 11 – Silver Spring, MD – The Fillmore Silver Spring\nNov 12 – Show information to come soon\nNov 14 – Montclair, NJ – The Wellmont Theater\nNov 15 – Pittsburgh, PA – Roxian Theatre\nNov 18 – Cleveland, OH – The Agora \nNov 19 – Detroit, MI – The Fillmore Detroit\nNov 20 – Columbus, OH – KEMBA Live!\nNov 22 – Onamia, MN – Grand Casino Mille Lacs Event Center\nNov 23 – Green Bay, WI – EPIC Event Center\nNov 25 – Chesterfield, MO – The Factory at The District\nNov 26 – Chicago, IL – House of Blues\nNov 28 – Oklahoma City, OK – Diamond Ballroom\nNov 29 – Show information to come soon\nDec 2 – Kansas City, MO – Uptown Theater\nDec 3 – Denver, CO – Ogden Theatre\nDec 6 – Tempe, AZ – Marquee Theatre\nDec 7 – Show information to come soon\n\n\nGRAMMY® Award-nominated songwriter, vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Wolfgang Van Halen continues to separate Mammoth from the pack. The music stands alone on a foundation anchored by his impressive sonic proficiency (across drums, bass, keys, and guitar) and airtight arena-size hooks with unforgettable vocals. He harbors an irresistible signature sound, inventive vision, and incomparable identity vaunted by a fervent global fanbase. For as unique as the music is, his story so far proves to be just as unprecedented. This is arguably the first hard rock act to genuinely break out from ground zero in the 2020’s, generating north of 100 million streams, toppling charts, and selling out headline tours less than five years since its debut. Back in 2021, Mammoth’s first offering, Mammoth WVH, took flight, bowing at #12 on the Billboard 200 and capturing #1 on three Billboard charts—Top Hard Rock Albums, Top Independent Albums, and Top Rock Albums. “Distance” soared as the first of two #1 Rock Radio Hits and earned a GRAMMY® Award nomination for “Best Rock Song.” Two years later, Mammoth II only saw him pick up the pace. It debuted in the Top 5 of the Billboard Top Album Sales Chart in addition to bringing him back to #1 on the Top Hard Rock Albums Chart. It incited widespread applause from Rolling Stone, Guitar World, GRAMMY.com, Classic Rock, American Songwriter, and KERRANG! The band canvased the globe with Metallica and Pantera and supported Foo Fighters in North America as well as filling houses on their own. They performed on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!, at MusiCares 2024 gala in honor of Jon Bon Jovi, and Wolf took the stage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame® Induction of Ozzy Osbourne. Now, Wolfgang pushes forward on Mammoth’s third full-length LP.\n\nConnect with Mammoth at:\nWebsite: www.mammoth.band\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MammothWVH\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mammothwvh/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MammothWVH\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@MammothWVH \n\nLyrics:\nWake up\nOpen up your tired eyes\nIt’s way down\nBurning up inside\n\nFade out\nAll of the surrounding noise and\nStand tall\nNow is not the time for burning out\n\nBreak me out of this\nHere we are ignoring it\nTake your hand in mine and \nWatch the end with me\n\nNo love\nBleeding out and bleeding over\nNo trust\nWho are you to me?\n\nToo loud\nBlind to all the ins and outs\nYou’re too proud\nHow? I’ll never-\nHow? I’ll never know\n\nBreak me out of this\nHere we are ignoring it\nTake your hand in mine and \nwatch the end with me\n\nWatch it end with me\n\nBreak me out of this\nHere we are ignoring it\nTake your hand in mine and \nWatch the end and...\n\nBreak me out of this\nHere we are ignoring it\nTake your hand in mine and \nWatch the end with me\n\n#mammothwvh #wolfgangvanhalen #mammoth"

Use my code TREE for $20 off your first SeatGeek order. https://seatgeek.onelink.me/RrnK/TREE\n\nThe NFL Draft has become a specatcle like none other: A three-day event celebrating the entry of hundreds of men into the league. Some of them will become Hall of Famers. Some of them will have long careers. Some will flame out of the league in next to no time whatsoever. However, for one moment, all of these men have a uniting commonality: They are in the NFL.\n\nThis draft was relatively unpredictable, minus the first overall pick. Prepare for chaos? I think?\n\nSee you in five years when we talk about this draft again. May this video be tribute to the festivities that occurred in the first round... and Shedeur Sanders.",

Use my code TREE for $20 off your first SeatGeek order. https://seatgeek.onelink.me/RrnK/TREE\n\nThe NFL Draft has become a specatcle like none other: A three-day event celebrating the entry of hundreds of men into the league. Some of them will become Hall of Famers. Some of them will have long careers. Some will flame out of the league in next to no time whatsoever. However, for one moment, all of these men have a uniting commonality: They are in the NFL.\n\nThis draft was relatively unpredictable, minus the first overall pick. Prepare for chaos? I think?\n\nSee you in five years when we talk about this draft again. May this video be tribute to the festivities that occurred in the first round... and Shedeur Sanders."

            "description": "Start a business with Shopify today: https://shopify.com/whyfiles Thanks Shopify for sponsoring this video!\n\nMysteries of the Sea Vol 2: Ghost Ships & Desert Galleons | Unexplained Maritime Disappearances\n\nThroughout maritime history, ships have been found drifting with crews mysteriously vanished, leaving behind half-eaten meals and personal belongings undisturbed. The Mary Celeste in 1872, the Carroll A. Deering in 1921, and even modern vessels like the Kaz II in 2007 share the same eerie pattern – perfectly seaworthy ships abandoned in an instant.\n\nSome ghost ships reveal more disturbing scenes, like the Ourang Medan, where an entire crew was found dead with faces frozen in terror.

Mary Celeste pada tahun 1872, Carroll A. Deering pada tahun 1921, dan bahkan kapal-kapal modern seperti Kaz II pada tahun 2007 memiliki pola yang sama – kapal-kapal yang masih layak laut ditinggalkan begitu saja dalam sekejap.\n\nBeberapa kapal hantu mengungkap pemandangan yang lebih mengganggu, seperti Ourang Medan, di mana seluruh awak kapal ditemukan tewas dengan wajah membeku ketakutan. Yang lainnya tampaknya melakukan perjalanan waktu, muncul beberapa dekade setelah mereka menghilang atau di lokasi yang mustahil.\n\nYang paling menarik adalah legenda tentang galleon Spanyol yang ditemukan jauh di Gurun Mojave, bermil-mil dari lautan mana pun. Misteri maritim ini membentang sepanjang abad dan samudra, mengingatkan kita bahwa terlepas dari teknologi yang kita miliki, beberapa hal masih berada di luar pemahaman manusia.\n\n#GhostShips #MisteriMaritim #AwakKapalYangMenghilang\n\n〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰\nProduser Eksekutif:\nJennifer Gentile\nGino Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nAnggota Patreon\n\nEditor:\nRyan Fitzgerald\nNate Lata\nBrandon Snyder\nJoe Stone\n\nProduser:\nErik Anderson\nHaley Burke\nJen Gentile\nVictoria Young\n\nRiset:\nHaley Burke\nAJ Gentile\nGino Gentile\nJen Gentile\nVictoria Young\n\nDitulis/Dibawakan oleh:\nAJ Gentile\nHecklefish J.

La Mary Celeste nel 1872, la Carroll A. Deering nel 1921 e persino imbarcazioni moderne come la Kaz II nel 2007 condividono lo stesso inquietante schema: navi perfettamente in grado di navigare abbandonate in un istante.\n\nAlcune navi fantasma rivelano scene più inquietanti, come l'Ourang Medan, dove un intero equipaggio è stato trovato morto con i volti paralizzati dal terrore. Altre sembrano viaggiare nel tempo, riapparendo decenni dopo la loro scomparsa o in luoghi impossibili.\n\nLa più affascinante è la leggenda di un galeone spagnolo ritrovato nel profondo del deserto del Mojave, a chilometri di distanza da qualsiasi oceano. Questi misteri marittimi attraversano secoli e oceani, ricordandoci che, nonostante la nostra tecnologia, alcune cose restano al di là della comprensione umana. #NaviFantasma #MisteriMarittimi #EquipaggiScomparsi\n\n〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰\nProduttori Esecutivi:\nJennifer Gentile\nGino Gentile\nAJ Gentile\nMembri Patreon\n\nEditor:\nRyan Fitzgerald\nNate Lata\nBrandon Snyder\nJoe Stone\n\nProduttori:\nErik Anderson\nHaley Burke\nJen Gentile\nVictoria Young\n\nRicerca:\nHaley Burke\nAJ Gentile\nGino Gentile\nJen Gentile\nVictoria Young\n\nScritto/Presentato da:\nAJ Gentile\nHecklefish J.
