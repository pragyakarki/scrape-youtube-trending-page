You’re going to laugh, cringe, and feel a little better about your own abilities. \n\nTour dates: www.AliSiddiq.com    \nJun 20:  Raleigh           \nJun 21: Nashville        \nAug 1-2: BREA, CA\nAug 8-9:   SALT LAKE CITY, UT\nAug 15-17: West Nyack, NY \nAug 20:   ALBANY, NY \nAugust 22: Atlantic City, NJ\nAugust 29 : Huntsville, AL \nAugust 30 : Chattanooga, TN\nAugust 31 : Greenville, SC \nSeptember 5 : Buffalo, NY \nSeptember 6 : Toronto, ON \nSeptember 12 : Lexington, KY\nSeptember 13 : St Louis, MO \nSeptember 19 : Gulfport, MS \nSeptember 20 : Dothan, AL \nSeptember 26 : San Diego, CA \nOctober 3 : Greensboro, NC \nOctober 4 : Columbia, SC \nOctober 10 : Wichita, KS \nOctober 11 : Fayetteville, AR \nOctober 17 : Louisville, KY \nOctober 18 : Cincinnati, OH  \nOctober 24 : Rockford, IL \nOctober 25 : Flint, MI \nNovember 1 : Little Rock, AR \nNovember 7 : Omaha, NE \nNovember 8 : Kansas City, MO \nNovember 14 : Orlando, FL \nNovember 15 : Tampa, FL \nNovember 21 : Norfolk, VA \nNovember 22 : Richmond, VA \nNovember 28 : Dallas, TX \nDecember 5 : Portland, OR \nDecember 6 : Seattle, WA\nDecember 12 : New Haven, CT\nDecember 13 : Brooklyn, NY \nDecember 19 : Fort Myers, FL \nDecember 20 : Palm Beach, FL \n\n\nConnect on social media!\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alisiddiq/?hl=en\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/ali.siddiq.92\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thealisiddiq\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ali_speaks\n\n#alisiddiq #standupcomedy #standup #comedy #comedian #comedyspecial #funny #trending #jokes"

I witajcie w moim wymarzonym haulu 7-Eleven!! Teraz, podczas naszych poprzednich podróży do Azji Wschodniej, zdecydowanie zauważyliśmy powszechność 7-Eleven niemal wszędzie - i nie tylko byliśmy zaskoczeni, jak szeroko rozpowszechnione i popularne były - szybko zdaliśmy sobie sprawę, że mają wiele naprawdę niesamowitych rzeczy, których nie mamy w Stanach - jak bao, herbaty, sando, makarony, mrożone kawy, unikalne smaki chipsów, kanapki naleśnikowe, lody kukurydziane - i wiele więcej!! A kiedy wróciliśmy - zacząłem zauważać, jak wiele osób online również chodzi do międzynarodowych 7-Eleven i robi zakupy przekąsek - i zdałem sobie sprawę - to ruch sklepów spożywczych!! \n\nWięc podczas naszych podróży w ciągu ostatniego roku zebraliśmy wycieczki i zakupy 7-Eleven w każdym kraju, który odwiedziliśmy - Singapurze, Malezji i Japonii... aby wypróbować kilka wirusowych przekąsek i ogólnie je porównać, ale także głównie po prostu po to, aby ucztować! 7-Eleven w którym kraju powinniśmy odwiedzić następnym razem? \n\nMój Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMój TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nKanał Tylera: https://www.youtube.com/@tylerwilliams \nNasz kanał YouTube Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/@safiyashorts\n\nSprawdź nasz sklep z gadżetami tutaj!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nProducenci wykonawczy: Safiya Nygaard i Tyler Williams\nProducent zarządzający: Lona Smith\nProducent pomocniczy: Ishara Mathews\nRedaktor: Andrew Lainhart\nRedaktor: Malcolm McLean\nMłodszy redaktor: Leslie Alcantar\nAsystent redaktora: Max Winiarski\nProjektant graficzny: Dayana Espinoza\n\nMUZYKA\nZa pośrednictwem AudioNetwork\n\n00:00 Intro\n03:32 Singapurski 7-Eleven (& 7-Cafe)\n07:01 Singapurski test smakowy 7-Eleven\n11:10 Największy 7-Eleven w Malezji\n16:00 Malezyjski test smakowy 7-Eleven\n19:29 The Big Daddy: Japoński 7-Eleven\n23:49 Japoński test smakowy 7-Eleven\n27:57 Finał Rankingi\n\n#vlog #jedzenie #smakosz #przekąski #7eleven"

En nuestros viajes anteriores al este de Asia, notamos la prevalencia de los 7-Elevens en casi todas partes. No solo nos sorprendió su popularidad, sino que enseguida nos dimos cuenta de que tenían un montón de cosas increíbles que no tenemos en Estados Unidos, como baos, tés, sándwiches, fideos, café helado, sabores únicos de papas fritas, sándwiches de panqueques, helado de maíz, ¡y mucho más! Y al regresar, empecé a notar cuánta gente en línea también iba a 7-Elevens internacionales y compraba comida, ¡y me di cuenta de que esto es un movimiento de tiendas de conveniencia!\n\nAsí que, durante nuestros viajes del último año, recopilamos tours y compras de 7-Elevens en cada país que visitamos: Singapur, Malasia y Japón… para probar algunos snacks virales y compararlos, ¡pero también para darnos un festín! ¿Qué 7-Eleven de qué país deberíamos visitar próximamente?\n\nMi Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMi TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nCanal de Tyler: https://www.youtube.com/@tylerwilliams\nNuestro canal de YouTube Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/@safiyashorts\n\n¡Descubre nuestra tienda de merchandising aquí! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nProductores ejecutivos: Safiya Nygaard y Tyler Williams\nProductora ejecutiva: Lona Smith\nProductora asociada: Ishara Mathews\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Malcolm McLean\nEditora junior: Leslie Alcantar\nEditor asistente: Max Winiarski\nDiseñadora gráfica: Dayana Espinoza\n\nMÚSICA\nVía AudioNetwork\n\n00:00 Introducción\n03:32 7-Eleven de Singapur (y 7-Café)\n07:01 Prueba de sabor del 7-Eleven de Singapur\n11:10 El 7-Eleven más grande de Malasia\n16:00 Prueba de sabor del 7-Eleven de Malasia\n19:29 El gran 7-Eleven japonés\n23:49 Prueba de sabor del 7-Eleven de Japón\n27:57 Clasificación final\n\n#vlog #comida #foodie #snacks #7eleven"

En welkom bij de 7-Eleven-vangst van mijn dromen!! Tijdens onze eerdere reizen naar Oost-Azië merkten we zeker de populariteit van 7-Elevens, die we vrijwel overal zagen. We waren niet alleen verrast door hoe wijdverspreid en populair ze waren, we realiseerden ons ook al snel dat ze een heleboel geweldige dingen hadden die we in de Verenigde Staten niet hebben - zoals bao's, thee, sando's, noedels, ijskoffie, unieke smaken chips, pannenkoekensandwiches, maïsijs ​​- en meer! En toen we terugkwamen, begon ik te merken hoeveel mensen online ook naar internationale 7-Elevens gingen en snacks kochten - en ik besefte: dit is een trend in gemakswinkels!\n\nDus tijdens onze reizen van het afgelopen jaar hebben we 7-Eleven-tours en -hauls verzameld in elk land dat we bezochten - Singapore, Maleisië en Japan... om wat virale snacks uit te proberen en ze in het algemeen te vergelijken, maar vooral ook gewoon om te smullen!

Und willkommen zu meinem Traum-7-Eleven-Einkauf! Auf unseren früheren Reisen nach Ostasien fiel uns die flächendeckende Präsenz von 7-Eleven-Läden auf – und wir waren nicht nur überrascht, wie weit verbreitet und beliebt sie waren, sondern merkten auch schnell, dass sie viele tolle Sachen hatten, die es in den USA nicht gibt – wie Baos, Tees, Sandos, Nudeln, Eiskaffee, einzigartige Chipssorten, Pfannkuchensandwiches, Maiseis – und vieles mehr! Nach unserer Rückkehr fiel mir auf, wie viele Leute online auch internationale 7-Eleven-Läden besuchten und Snacks kauften – und mir wurde klar: Das ist eine Convenience-Store-Bewegung!\n\nAlso haben wir auf unseren Reisen im letzten Jahr 7-Eleven-Touren und -Besuche in jedem unserer Länder – Singapur, Malaysia und Japan – gesammelt, um ein paar beliebte Snacks zu probieren und zu vergleichen, aber vor allem auch einfach nur, um zu schlemmen!

E bem-vindos à compra dos meus sonhos na 7-Eleven!! Em nossas viagens anteriores ao Leste Asiático, notamos claramente a presença de 7-Elevens em praticamente todos os lugares – e não só ficamos surpresos com o quão difundidos e populares eles eram, como rapidamente percebemos que eles tinham muitas coisas incríveis que não temos nos Estados Unidos – como baos, chás, sandos, macarrão instantâneo, cafés gelados, sabores únicos de salgadinhos, sanduíches de panqueca, sorvete de milho – e muito mais!! E quando voltamos, comecei a notar quantas pessoas online também estavam indo a 7-Elevens internacionais e comprando lanches – e percebi – que isso é um movimento de lojas de conveniência!!\n\nEntão, em nossas viagens no ano passado, coletamos informações sobre passeios e compras de 7-Elevens em cada país que visitamos – Cingapura, Malásia e Japão… para experimentar alguns lanches virais e compará-los, mas também principalmente para nos deliciarmos!

Dan begitu kami kembali - saya mulai memperhatikan berapa banyak orang daring yang juga pergi ke 7-Eleven internasional dan melakukan pembelian makanan ringan - dan saya menyadari - ini adalah gerakan toko serba ada!! \n\nJadi dalam perjalanan kami selama setahun terakhir, kami telah mengumpulkan tur dan pembelian 7-Eleven di setiap negara yang kami kunjungi - Singapura, Malaysia, dan Jepang… untuk mencoba beberapa makanan ringan yang sedang tren, dan membandingkannya secara umum, tetapi juga sebagian besar hanya untuk berpesta! 7-Eleven negara mana yang harus kami kunjungi selanjutnya?

And welcome to the 7-Eleven haul of my dreams!! Now, on our previous trips to East Asia, we definitely noticed the prevalence of 7-Elevens pretty much everywhere - and not only were we surprised by how widespread and popular they were - we quickly realized, they had a lot of pretty awesome stuff we don’t have in the states - like, baos, teas, sandos, noodles, iced coffees, unique chip flavors, pancake sandwiches, corn ice cream - and more!! And once we returned - I started to notice how many people online were also going to international 7-Elevens and doing snack hauls - and I realized - this is a convenience store movement!! \n\nSo on our travels over the past year, we’ve collected 7-Eleven tours and hauls in each country we visited - Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan… to try out some viral snacks, and generally compare them, but also mostly just to feast! Which country’s 7-Eleven should we visit next? \n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@tylerwilliams \nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/@safiyashorts\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nExecutive Producers: Safiya Nygaard & Tyler Williams\nManaging Producer: Lona Smith\nAssociate Producer: Ishara Mathews\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Malcolm McLean\nJunior Editor: Leslie Alcantar\nAssistant Editor: Max Winiarski\nGraphic Designer: Dayana Espinoza\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\n00:00 Intro\n03:32 Singaporean 7-Eleven (& 7-Cafe)\n07:01 Singapore 7-Eleven Taste Test\n11:10 The Largest 7-Eleven in Malaysia\n16:00 Malaysia 7-Eleven Taste Test\n19:29 The Big Daddy: Japanese 7-Eleven\n23:49 Japan 7-Eleven Taste Test\n27:57 Final Rankings\n\n#vlog #food #foodie #snacks #7eleven"

We flew on Global Airlines first ever flight from Manchester Airport to JFK, New York in first class! This airline was started buy a guy who we've followed on instagram for years and had never met...until today ;)\n\nHuge thanks to James and the Global Airlines team for having us on this unforgettable flight! (and for giving us 50% off our tickets!)\n\nEpisode 962 | Filmed May 2025\n\nSubscribe to our new friend  @jameswarrenolivertravelexpert  :)\n https://youtu.be/W92wnw7Ytq8?si=yj_Jm5asGT03YMJo \n\n——————————————————\n\nWho are Kara and Nate?! \n\n2016-2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s \n\n2020-2024: https://youtu.be/ikAN9e0gBaU?si=G644UGWIqPrOzTYW\n\nOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. \n\nWe discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)\n\nSo after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.\n\nOur goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents.

            "description": "(AP) The man suspected of killing a Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another has been taken into custody, two law enforcement officials said, bringing an end to a nearly two-day search that put the state on edge.\r\n\r\nVance Boelter was arrested Sunday evening. The arrest was confirmed to The Associated Press by law enforcement officials were who were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin home, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away.\r\n\r\nBoelter was captured in Minnesota, though officials didn’t immediately say where.\r\n\r\nA criminal complaint unsealed Sunday night says Boelter faces two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder in the deaths of the Hortmans and the wounding of Hoffman and his wife.\r\n\r\nThe Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champin early Saturday. After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned of that shooting, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans’ home.\r\n\r\nThe complaint says the Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home. It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene.\r\n\r\nEarlier Sunday Drew Evans, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said authorities found a car very early Sunday they believed Boelter was using, a few miles from his home in Green Isle, in the farm country about an hour west of Minneapolis. He also said they found evidence in the car that was relevant to the investigation, but did not provide details.\r\n\r\nAuthorities named Boelter, 57, as a suspect, saying he wore a mask as he posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car.\r\n\r\nEvens confirmed that investigators found a cowboy hat near the vehicle and believe it belonged to Boelter. The superintendent also said authorities interviewed Boelter’s wife and other family members in connection with Saturday’s shootings. He said they were cooperative and were not in custody.\r\n\r\nThe FBI had issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. They circulated a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings.\r\n\r\nMore than 100 law enforcement officers including SWAT teams were searching the area, including nearby homes, Evans said. He also said they had received more than 400 tips from the public.\r\n\r\nThe earlier search happened in rural Sibley County, roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis, where Boelter had a home with his wife and five children. Residents in the area received an emergency alert about the located vehicle that warned them to lock their doors and cars.\r\n\r\nThe shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned.\r\n\r\nBrightly colored flowers and small American flags were placed Sunday on the gray marbled stone of the Minnesota State Capitol along with a photo of the Hortmans. People scrawled messages on small notes including, “You were our leader through the hardest of times. Rest in Power.”\r\n\r\nFull coverage: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/nation-world/minnesota-lawmakers-shooting-suspect-search-hortman-hoffman/507-24c79278-b67b-426c-bb87-ff0d1bc1c1db",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold.

By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialAudio",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

To honor the anniversary, the Pittsburgh emcee assembled a group of Tiny Desk veterans, Pennsylvania natives and his DJ to reimagine highlights from the classic mixtape, plus tracks from Kush & Orange Juice 2, its similar, yet more mature follow-up.\n\nSomething was happening during the entire show and lots of us in the room could feel it. We were waiting for him to engage with us, but he didn’t. I stepped in after a few songs to remind him that it was OK to do so — still, nothing. But then, after “Crime Bud and Women,” Wiz spoke to the audience for the first and only time, wiping away tears: “You made me cry. F*** y’all!” \n\nI can muster up a few guesses as to why the emotion overflowed. Wiz had a host of family and friends present in this very intimate setting, including his father. And he did tell me how much he loves performing.
