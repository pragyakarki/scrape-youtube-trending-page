            "description": "They’re back for seconds. #Meg2 only in theaters August 4.\n\nGet ready for the ultimate adrenaline rush this summer in “Meg 2: The Trench,” a literally larger-than-life thrill ride that supersizes the 2018 blockbuster and takes the action to higher heights and even greater depths with multiple massive Megs and so much more! Dive into uncharted waters with Jason Statham and global action icon Wu Jing as they lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean. Their voyage spirals into chaos when a malevolent mining operation threatens their mission and forces them into a high-stakes battle for survival. Pitted against colossal Megs and relentless environmental plunderers, our heroes must outrun, outsmart, and outswim their merciless predators in a pulse-pounding race against time. Immerse yourself in the most electrifying cinematic experience of the year with “Meg 2: The Trench” – where the depths of the ocean are matched only by the heights of sheer, unstoppable excitement!\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and CMC Pictures present “Meg 2: The Trench,” with Statham and Jing headlining an ensemble cast that also includes Sophia Cai (“The Meg”), Page Kennedy (“The Meg”), Sergio Peris-Mencheta (“Rambo: Last Blood”), Skyler Samuels (“The Gifted”), and Cliff Curtis (“Avatar” franchise).\n“Meg 2: The Trench” is directed by Ben Wheatley (“In the Earth,” “Free Fire”), from a screenplay by Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber (“The Meg,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”) and Dean Georgaris (“The Meg,” “Lara Croft: Toom Raider – The Cradle of Life”), and a screen story by Dean Georgaris and Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber, based on the novel The Trench by Steve Alten. The film is produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura (“The Meg,” “Bumblebee”) and Belle Avery (“The Meg,” “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead”), and executive produced by Jason Statham, Cate Adams, Ruigang Li, Catherine Xujun Ying, Wu Jing, E. Bennett Walsh, Erik Howsam, Gerald R. Molen and Randy Greenberg. \n\nJoining director Wheatley behind the camera are director of photography Haris Zambarloukous (“Belfast,” “Murder on the Orient Express”), production designer Chris Lowe (“The Gray Man,” “No Time to Die”) and editor Jonathan Amos (“Baby Driver,” “Paddington 2”). The visual effects supervisor is Pete Bebb (“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” “Inception”), and costume designer is Lindsay Pugh (“The Matrix Resurrections,” “Krypton”). The music is by Harry Gregson-Williams (“The Meg,” “The Martian”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and CMC Pictures present, in association with DF Pictures, a di Bonaventura/Apelles Entertainment, Inc. production, a Ben Wheatley film, “Meg 2: The Trench.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on August 4, 2023 and internationally beginning 02 August 2023.",

Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. Oscar® winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. \n \nAcademy Award® nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence.\n \nOppenheimer also stars Oscar® winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar® nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. \n \nThe cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). \n \nThe film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. \n\nOppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography. \n\nNolan’s films, including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and The Dark Knight trilogy, have earned more than $5 billion at the global box office and have been awarded 11 Oscars and 36 nominations, including two Best Picture nominations. \n\nSocial Handles:\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/oppenheimermovie    \nTW: https://www.twitter.com/@oppenheimerfilm  \nFB: https://www.facebook.com/OppenheimerMovie \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/OppenheimerMovie/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/oppenheimermovie\nWebsite: https://www.OppenheimerMovie.com   \n#Oppenheimer",

Including an entire secret comedy show I did last night, just to warm up for the Tour. That is the Level TommyInnit goes to for you all. Mmmmm. Mhm.

At the humble age of Ninteteen, I have became a sensation, an inspiration & god among the youth of this world. If you look up to be, keep doing so, as I teach you how to wiggle your way through life.\n\nYou are all so damn welcome that I am Alive\n\nEm = Molly. Same person. (M = the M for Molly! Such a Smart E-Name!)\n\nMy merchandise will be available next week. Because marketing is for fools and I trust you all to buy the good quality things I Offer you, as I am a high level trader, click this link if you just want to see what all the clothes look like. https://imgur.com/QJm68CL \nThe store is unfinished but I do not care because I am a Transparent gamer. The url: tommyinnit.store\n\nAlso my Tour is happening in a month, an excellent, creative show about how to become an Incredibly Successful YouTuber, and you can get tickets here\nhttps://sjm.lnk.to/Tommyinnit\nI know it is somewhat hard to comprehend what a TommyInnit \"comedy show\" actually entails, but do not worry, as over the next month before June 1st (the tour beginning) I will be posting many videos, to make sure you know it's worth coming to this One Time Opportunity. Including an entire secret comedy show I did last night, just to warm up for the Tour. That is the Level TommyInnit goes to for you all. Mmmmm. Mhm. He is \"the best\" of the Lot, if you ask me.\n\nSocials:\nFollow my Twitter - @tommyinnit\nFollow my Instagram - @tommyinnit\n\nvideo edited by Me\nsubtitled by @drawthatredstone (famed twitch moderator & local philantropist)"

The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021’s six-time Academy Award-winning “Dune.”\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Wonka,” “Call Me by Your Name”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “Malcolm & Marie,” “Euphoria”), Rebecca Ferguson (“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning”), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Avengers: End Game,” “Milk”), Oscar nominee Austin Butler (“Elvis,” “Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood”), Oscar nominee Florence Pugh (“Black Widow,” “Little Women”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Thor: Love and Thunder”), Oscar winner Christopher Walken (“The Deer Hunter,” “Hairspray”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Léa Seydoux (the “James Bond” franchise and “Crimes of the Future”), with Stellan Skarsgård (the “Mamma Mia!” films, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), with Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”).\n“Dune: Part Two” will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. \nVilleneuve directed from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts based on Herbert’s novel.  The film is produced by Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Villeneuve, Tanya Lapointe and Patrick McCormick.  The executive producers are Josh Grode, Herbert W. Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, with Kevin J. Anderson serving as creative consultant.\nVilleneuve is again collaborating with his “Dune” creatives: Oscar-winning director of photography Greig Fraser; Oscar-winning production designer Patrice Vermette; Oscar-winning editor Joe Walker; Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert; Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West.  Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer is again on hand to create the score.\n“Dune: Part Two” was filmed on location in Budapest, Abu Dhabi, Jordan and Italy.  The film is slated for a November 3, 2023 worldwide release from Warner Bros. Pictures.",

Then finally I recycled old slag to see if it would produce any more iron.\n\nThe first way was to roast the ore before smelting. This drove off the moisture and volatiles in the ore as well as burning off any sulfur present. The resulting ore produced a higher yield of iron than normal (33g iron as opposed to about 15g iron as usual for the same volume of ore, charcoal and time). \n\nNext lime was added to the smelt as a flux in the form of snail shells. The theory was that the lime would lower the melting point of any silica in the ore to make a runnier slag and help the iron come together more. The result was very bad, no iron was produced apart from 1 or 2 prills. I suspect the ore is already basic in chemistry and adding a basic flux in the form of lime made it so basic that the slag was too viscous. The ore probably won't benefit from a basic flux but might benefit from an acid flux such as sand or slag from previous smelts.\n\nNext I tried smelting slag from previous smelts to see if anymore iron would come out. It did surprisingly, less than fresh ore but still worth doing. For this reason it might be useful to add old slag as a flux to future smelts to help the slag form more easily, while contributing some more iron to the smelt.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

                "description": "Hello and welcome to another video!\n\nToday we’re attempting to make some Japanese aesthetic sandwiches! Safiya and I have seen these all over our Youtube homepage in the form of delicious looking thumbnails, and we figured we should try to make some of our own at home. We’ll be making three different sandwiches - 2 sweet and 1 savory: a strawberry & cream, a fruit flower, and an egg sandwich! It’ll be hard for us to go wrong taste-wise, but how GOOD can we get them to look? Can we match those eye catching thumbnails? We'll have to find out! \n\nps - we did have some technical difficulties with our audio during our second sandwich - it sounds a little tin-y, so if you notice it, it's not just you! sorry about that! \n\nYou can check out our merch here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nProduced & Edited by\nCarly Dawson\nNez Covington\nTyler Williams\nSafiya Nygaard\nAlaina Simmons\nHailey Cox\n\nGFX by\nDayana Espinoza\nElizabeth Pinotti\nCarly Dawson\n\nMUSIC\nVia Audio Network"

Thanks to Steelseries for sponsoring the video.\n--\nRedfall is creatively vapid, amateurishly designed and woefully unfinished. It is a (yet another) stain on Bethesda as a publisher and calls into question the faith one might have put into Xbox this generation. It’s just an absolute catastrophe of a videogame by every single metric and it sits alongside the likes for Fallout 76 and Anthem as one of gaming’s biggest disappointments and cautionary tales.\n\n#Xbox #Redfall #Review\n--\nThanks for taking the time to watch the video.

            "description": "The Met Gala 2023 was fashion's biggest night, and it brought out the best in celebrities. In this OSSA'm video, we'll be exploring all of the Met Gala’s 2023 must-see looks and biggest moments!\n\nIn today's OSSA'm video, you will learn that this year's theme was \"\"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\"\" and celebrities paid homage to the legendary designer. Most celebrities followed Karl's dress code, wearing black and white gowns. Florence Pugh, Olivia Rodrigo, and Jenna Ortega perfectly combined these colors. Celebrities also had fun imitating Karl's favorite cat, Choupette. Jared Leto even brought a giant copy of the cat's head with him. Doja Cat and Lil Nas X took their cat look further. Lil Nas X covered his body with nothing but a thong and a silver tint, while Doja Cat completed her Oscar de la Renta hooded gown with cat ears on the hood. Rihanna made a bold statement, arriving covered with iconic Chanel camellia flowers from head to toe. Cardi B also wore a stunning white dress but later changed to a pink gown that didn't match the dress code of the event. There were also examples of chic and elegance at the event, with Pedro Pascal and Pete Davidson paying tribute to Chanel in their looks. Kim Kardashian arrived at the Met Gala dripping in precious gems, wearing a dress made from 50,000 pearls and 16,000 crystals. Her ex-boyfriend, Pete Davidson, posed on the red carpet alone this time, but they reunited inside for a sweet talk. Meanwhile, Serena Williams announced her second pregnancy at the event.\n\nOverall, the Met Gala 2023 was a night of surprises, and it showcased some of the most memorable fashion moments in recent history.
