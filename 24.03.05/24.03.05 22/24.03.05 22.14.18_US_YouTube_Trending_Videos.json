That's probably a more \"real\" rating for the Barbie movie. \n\nCHAPTERS: \n0:00 - Intro\n0:57 - The Plan\n2:53 - Barbie in the Nutcracker (2001)\n4:42 - Barbie as Rapunzel (2002)\n5:41 - Barbie of Swan Lake (2003)\n6:44 - Barbie as the Princess & The Pauper (2004)\n8:13 - Lore Overview - Day 1\n10:05 - Day 2\n10:32 - Barbie: Fairytopia (2005)\n11:59 - Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus (2005)\n13:12 - Barbie Fairytopia: Mermaidia (2006)\n14:28 - The Barbie Diaries (2006)\n27:08 - Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses (2006)\n28:17 - Barbie Fairytopia: Magic of the Rainbow (2007)\n29:25 - Barbie as the Island Princess (2007)\n30:49 - Barbie Mariposa (2008)\n31:58 - Barbie and the Diamond Castle (2008)\n33:29 - Barbie in ‘A Christmas Carol’ (2008)\n34:16 - Barbie Presents: Thumbelina (2009)\n35:05 - Barbie and the Three Musketeers (2009)\n36:42 - Lore Overview - Day 2\n38:06 - Day 3\n39:15 - Barbie in a Mermaid Tale (2010)\n39:58 - Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale (2010)\n41:20 - Barbie: A Fairy Secret (2011)\n42:19 - Barbie: Princess Charm School (2011)\n43:23 - Barbie: A Perfect Christmas (2011)\n44:23 - Barbie in a Mermaid Tale 2 (2012)\n45:13 - Barbie: The Princess & The Popstar (2012)\n59:09 - Barbie in The Pink Shoes (2013)\n1:00:02 - Barbie: Mariposa and the Fairy Princess (2013)\n1:01:13 - Barbie & Her Sister in a Pony Tale (2013)\n1:02:31 - I am struggling \n1:04:07 - Lore Overview - Day 3\n1:06:40 - Day 4\n1:07:07 - Barbie: The Pearl Princess (2013)\n1:08:14 - Barbie in The Secret Door (2014)\n1:09:19 - Barbie in Princess Power (2015)\n1:10:33 - Barbie in Rock ‘N Royals (2015)\n1:11:33 - Barbie & her Sisters in the Great Puppy Adventure (2015)\n1:12:51 - Barbie: Spy Squad (2016)\n1:13:51 - Barbie: Star Light Adventure (2016)\n1:15:07 - Barbie & Her Sisters in A Puppy Chase\n1:28:29 - Lore Overview - Day 4\n1:30:16 - Day 5\n1:30:37 - Barbie Video Game Hero (2017)\n1:31:52 - Barbie: Dolphin Magic (2017)\n1:32:32 - Barbie Princess Adventure (2021)\n1:33:47 - Barbie and Chelsea: The Lost Birthday (2021)\n1:34:34 - Barbie: Big City Big Dreams (2022)\n1:35:18 - Day 6\n1:35:37 - Barbie: Mermaid Power (2022)\n1:36:12 - Barbie: Epic Road Trip (2022)\n1:37:29 - Barbie: Skipper and the Big Babysitting Adventure (2023)\n1:38:20 - Final Lore Overview\n1:40:47 - Ted’s BCU Theory\n1:46:57 - Finale"

The guys in the shop were able to make this clean light rack for the top of the truck that flows so well with the lines of the truck. We have the lights tied into their own battery bank that we have mounted in the bed of the truck so it doesn't pull any energy from the truck. We love they way they turned out on this truck! If you're in the market for the brightest lights in the game please go check them out!\nhttps://www.bajadesigns.com/\n\nWe also want to give a huge shout out to ArcticFX! I had a vision in my mind on what I wanted but couldn't get it dialed in just right till I handed the design work over to their team. Once design was dialed in they sent the wrap out and made it happen! We've been using ArcticFX for years now helping us with everything from my personal sleds to our giveaway trucks, they are absolute animals in the wrap game. If you are in the market for a new wrap for your sled/UTV/Bike please hit them up. They truly have changed the custom wrap game!\nhttps://www.arcticfxgraphics.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/arcticfxgraphics\n\nWe also want to give a big thanks to the team at @helltraxx! They have built the world’s best tracks! We’ve ran this set on a few different builds and we’re blown away at how well they work! Zero issues on each of the vehicles! Check them out as they do big things! @helltraxx \n\nYou can win one of my personal vehicles by subscribing to all of my channels right now!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/HeavyDSparks\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/HeavyChecklist\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@heavydsparksespanol\n\nCustom Brodozer Yankum Rope: https://brodozerrope.com\n\nAdvertising and partnership inquiries email info@heavydsparks.com\n\nFollow Me on Insta: https://www.instagram.com/heavydsparks\n\n#heavydsparks #tesla #cybertruck",

In their greed for magical power, your ancestors unleashed a pestilence that consumed the world.\n\nEnshrouded is a game of survival, crafting, and Action RPG combat, set within a sprawling voxel-based continent. As you journey across the mountains and deserts of an open world, you are free to choose your path and shape your destiny.\n\nIgnite the Ancient power of the Flame, and piece together the fragments of a story that unfolds below the surface.\n\nSURVIVE THE SHROUD\nYou start with nothing but the will to survive the wilds. You must scrape and scavenge through the ruined remnants of a lost kingdom, and fend off the beasts that hunger for your flesh.\n\nJourney through forests, caves, dungeons, searching for secret knowledge and treasure. Build the strength to venture into the Shroud and bring the fight back to the horrors of the deep.\n\nHEART POUNDING ACTION COMBAT\nThe Shroud consumes the land it corrupts, mutating and guiding all life it encounters. Cleave your way through ravaging factions and formidable bosses, battling Scavenger in the forests, Vukah in the caves, and Fell creatures in the mist.\n\nDuck, parry, and surprise your foes with unexpected fighting skills and powerful spells. Exploit the weaknesses of your enemies as you develop your own unique playstyle with an in-depth skill tree system.\n\nCREATE EPIC BUILDS\nBring life back to the land! Voxel-based building unleashes your creative vision, allowing you to create grand architecture on an epic scale, customized with a vast assortment of materials and furniture.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling!

Using the same amount of ore and charcoal, the original blower yielded 30 g of iron where as the new blower yielded 51 g. The previous all time record was 41 g from several years ago but the new blower it beat that by 10 g on its first run. The energy saved by having the fan spin constantly in one direction no doubt contributes to the better performance of the blower. As with the old blower, the new one produces high carbon iron prills (cast iron blobs) in slag. The brittle slag crushes easily while the iron prills remain intact to be picked out by hand or gravity separated with panning. The iron prills were also quite large and more numerous than smelts done with the old blower.\n\nAlso in this video is a forging experiment. Using iron from previous smelts, a crude bar of iron was melted together into in a mold. The iron prills were placed in a clay mold, put into a forge and heated with charcoal using a flat nozzle tuyere. The process produced a 8cm long, 2.5cm wide bar. This bar was then heated to a red heat with wood for a while to anneal it, making it malleable in theory. However, when I tried to forge it, it crumbled apart. The waste iron was set aside in a pot for re-smelting so as not to lose it. \n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

            "description": "Welcome to the show. #TheWatchers only in theaters June 7.\n\nhttps://www.areyouwatching.com/ #AreYouWatching\n\nFrom producer M. Night Shyamalan comes “The Watchers,” written and directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan and based on the novel by A.M. Shine. The film follows Mina, a 28-year-old artist, who gets stranded in an expansive, untouched forest in western Ireland. When Mina finds shelter, she unknowingly becomes trapped alongside three strangers who are watched and stalked by mysterious creatures each night.\n\nYou can’t see them, but they see everything.\n\n“The Watchers” stars Dakota Fanning (“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “Ocean’s Eight”), Georgina Campbell (“Barbarian,” “Suspicion”), Oliver Finnegan (“Creeped Out,” “Outlander”) and Olwen Fouere (“The Northman,” “The Tourist”). The film is produced by M. Night Shyamalan, Ashwin Rajan and Nimitt Mankad. The executive producers are Jo Homewood and Stephen Dembitzer. \n\nJoining writer/director Shyamalan behind-the-camera are director of photography Eli Arenson (“Lamb,” “Hospitality”), production designer Ferdia Murphy (“Lola,” “Finding You”), editor Job ter Burg (“Benedetta,” “Elle”) and costume design by Frank Gallacher (“Sebastian,” “Aftersun”). The music is by Abel Korzeniowski (“Till,” “The Nun”). \n\nNew Line Cinema presents “The Watchers,” set to open in theaters internationally beginning 5 June 2024 and in North America on June 7, 2024; it will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.",

            "description": "The former president has plenty of valuable assets he could borrow against to pay his legal penalties. Here’s the math behind his path forward.\n\nNew York attorney general Letitia James vowed this week to seize Donald Trump’s assets if he could not pay the roughly $454 million he now owes the state. But make no mistake: Trump’s balance sheet is strong enough for him to pay his penalties—without selling a thing.\n\nTrump, who Forbes most recently estimated to be worth $2.6 billion, owes New York State over $350 million, plus around $100 million (and climbing every day) in interest, and he owes some $88 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll for sexual abuse and defamation verdicts against him. He has around $400 million of liquid assets on hand, so he could simply write a check to pay much of what he owes right now. To cover the rest, though, Trump, who once called himself the “king of debt,” could go another route. He could theoretically borrow money against one or more of the 27 mortgage-free properties in his portfolio, which are collectively worth more than $1.1 billion.\n\nRead the full story on Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/02/23/heres-why-trump-wont-have-to-sell-any-buildings-to-come-up-with-540-million/?sh=13e899521cf8\n\nForbes Daily Briefing shares the best of Forbes reporting on wealth, business, entrepreneurship, leadership and more.

                "description": "The former president has plenty of valuable assets he could borrow against to pay his legal penalties. Here’s the math behind his path forward.\n\nNew York attorney general Letitia James vowed this week to seize Donald Trump’s assets if he could not pay the roughly $454 million he now owes the state. But make no mistake: Trump’s balance sheet is strong enough for him to pay his penalties—without selling a thing.\n\nTrump, who Forbes most recently estimated to be worth $2.6 billion, owes New York State over $350 million, plus around $100 million (and climbing every day) in interest, and he owes some $88 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll for sexual abuse and defamation verdicts against him. He has around $400 million of liquid assets on hand, so he could simply write a check to pay much of what he owes right now. To cover the rest, though, Trump, who once called himself the “king of debt,” could go another route. He could theoretically borrow money against one or more of the 27 mortgage-free properties in his portfolio, which are collectively worth more than $1.1 billion.\n\nRead the full story on Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/02/23/heres-why-trump-wont-have-to-sell-any-buildings-to-come-up-with-540-million/?sh=13e899521cf8\n\nForbes Daily Briefing shares the best of Forbes reporting on wealth, business, entrepreneurship, leadership and more.

The car started to smoke, then completely cut out. We couldnt solve the issue and had to take it to mclaren themselves to fix it. After that @BenCollinsDrives took the 720s for a run around the track but it all ended badly as we tried to push him a little too hard.\n\nThanks so much to @RoadToSuccessOfficialPodcast  & @BenCollinsDrives \n\n👇 FOR MORE CONTENT CHECK OUT MY SECOND CHANNEL 👇\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@matarmstrongmk2\n\n⬇️ ALL MA MERCHANDISE ⬇️\nhttps://matarmstrong.co.uk/\n\n⬇️ Follow Me Here Aswell ⬇️\nhttps://facebook.com/matarmstrongbmx\nhttps://instagram.com/matarmstrongbmx",

            "description": "This Summer the American Saga begins. Horizon: An American Saga - Only in Theaters June 28 #Horizonamericansaga\n\nAcademy Award-winning visionary filmmaker Kevin Costner directs New Line Cinema’s vast “Horizon: An American Saga” Chapters One and Two, a multi-faceted chronicle covering the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West.  A story of America too big for one film, this true\ncinematic event also stars Costner, who co-writes with Jon Baird (“The Explorers Guild”) and produces through his Territory Pictures.  \n\nIn the great tradition of Warner Bros. Pictures’ iconic Westerns, “Horizon: An American Saga” explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won—and lost—through the blood, sweat and tears of many.  Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner’s ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.  \n\nCostner stars alongside an impressive ensemble cast that includes Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Owen Crow Shoe, Tatanka Means, Ella Hunt, Tim Guinee, Danny Huston, Colin Cunningham, Scott Haze, Tom Payne, Abbey Lee, Michael Rooker, Will Patton, Georgia MacPhail, Douglas Smith, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Alejandro Edda, Wasé Winyan Chief, Michael Anganaro, Angus Macfadyen, Jon Beavers, Alex Nibley, Kathleen Quinlan, Etienne Kellici, Amos Jason Charging Cloud, Bodhi Okuma Linton, Gregory Cruz, James Russo, Jeff Fahey, David O’Hara, Chris Conner, Leroy M. Silva, Bernardo Velasco, Tom Everett, Glynn Turman, Giovanni Ribisi and more.\n\nCostner returns to directing for the first time since his 2003 critically acclaimed hit “Open Range,” and revisits Civil War-era America, the setting for his 1990 blockbuster and directorial debut, “Dances with Wolves,” which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.  He produces alongside Howard Kaplan and Mark Gillard, with Danny Peykoff, Robert Scannell, Armyan Bernstein, Charlie Lyons, Barry Berg and Rod Lake executive producing.\n\nCostner is joined behind the camera by director of photography J. Michael Muro (“Billionaire Boys Club,” “Parker”), production designer Derek R. Hill (“Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” “The Magnificent Seven”), editor Miklos Wright (“For All Mankind,” “Open Range”) and costume designer Lisa Lovaas (“Ambulance,” “Transformers: The Last Knight”).  The music is by Oscar nominee John Debney (“The Passion of the Christ,” “The Greatest Showman”).\n\nA New Line Cinema presentation of a Territory Pictures production, “Horizon: An American Saga” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.  The films will be released in theaters nationwide, the first on June 28, 2024, the second on August 16, 2024.",
