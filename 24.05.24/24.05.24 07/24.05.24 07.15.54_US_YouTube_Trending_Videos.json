Oscar-nominated, singular creative visionary Tim Burton and Oscar nominee and star Michael Keaton reunite for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the long-awaited sequel to Burton’s award-winning Beetlejuice.  \n\nKeaton returns to his iconic role alongside Oscar nominee Winona Ryder (Stranger Things, Little Women) as Lydia Deetz and two-time Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara (Schitt$ Creek, Corpse Bride) as Delia Deetz, with new cast members Justin Theroux (Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi, The Leftovers), Monica Bellucci (Spectre, The Matrix films), Arthur Conti (House of the Dragon) in his feature film debut, with Emmy nominee Jenna Ortega (Wednesday, Scream VI) as Lydia’s daughter, Astrid, and Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (Poor Things, At Eternity’s Gate).\n\nBeetlejuice is back!  After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River.  Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened.  With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice's name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.\n\nBurton, a genre unto himself, directs from a screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (Wednesday), story by Gough & Millar and Seth Grahame-Smith (The LEGO® Batman Movie), based on characters created by Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson.  The film’s producers are Marc Toberoff, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Tommy Harper and Burton, with Sara Desmond, Katterli Frauenfelder, Gough, Millar, Brad Pitt, Larry Wilson, Laurence Senelick, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary, Anthony Tittanegro, Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg executive producing.\n\nBurton’s creatives behind the scenes includes director of photography Haris Zambarloukos (Meg 2: The Trench, Murder on the Orient Express); such previous and frequent collaborators as production designer Mark Scruton (Wednesday), editor Jay Prychidny (Wednesday), Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (Alice in Wonderland, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Sleepy Hollow), Oscar-winning creature effects and special makeup FX creative supervisor Neal Scanlan (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and Oscar-nominated composer Danny Elfman (Big Fish, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman); and Oscar-winning hair and makeup designer Christine Blundell (Topsy-Turvy).\n\nA Warner Bros. Pictures presentation, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice will be released only in theaters and IMAX on September 6, 2024 nationwide, and internationally beginning 4 September 2024.

First up, we discuss Bronny James going through the combine and the NBA draft process and what it's like for LeBron as a father. Then we dive into the NBA Playoffs - starting with a conversation around the MVPs of these playoffs - the role players. Guys like Naz Reid, P.J. Washington, T. J. McConnel and more. Then we dive into the Eastern Conference Finals between Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers and Jayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics. We discuss why the Celtics are so difficult to guard and how Indiana makes defenses uncomfortable. Then we dive into the Western Conference Finals between Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and the Minnesota Timberwolves and Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks. LeBron and JJ discuss Ant and Luka's ability to go away from ballscreens like Dwyane Wade and how the Wolves make the court smaller with their defense. Finally, LeBron weighs in on the hate Caitlin Clark has gotten so far in the WNBA with the Indiana Fever.\n\nSubscribe to Mind the Game with LeBron James and JJ Redick YouTube channel today for more NBA insight, analysis, highlights and more.\n\n#nba #mindthegame #lebronjames",

            "description": "Lavell Crawford stops by Club Shay Shay for a laugh-filled discussion with Shannon Sharpe. First, Lavell discusses his friendly feud with Bruce Bruce (which started over Bruce Bruce’s comments on Club Shay Shay) over their similar sizes and recounts getting kicked off a plane for being belligerently drunk.\n\nHe shares his weight loss journey, driven by health complications and his sister, talks about his past food addiction and claims he would’ve eaten 300 hamburgers for $3000 at his heaviest. Lavell addresses the growing use of Ozempic for weight loss, especially among kids, and humorously compares Drake’s alleged BBL to a candy apple. He expresses his preference for cuisine over fast food, inventing the “Real Mac” and appreciating vegan salads.\n\nLavell also incidents of joke theft involving Katt Williams, Cedric the Entertainer and Tyler Perry, and reveals his supportive nature by spilling that he often writes jokes and punchlines for other comedians for free. He talks about the opportunity Steve Harvey gave him at the Hoodie Awards, reminisces about encounters with Rickey Smiley, Michael Jordan, and Charles Oakley, and shares his love story with his wife and their journey through struggles and successes.\n\nThen he recalls the moment he realized he was really big after a doctor recognized his need to lose weight just from a phone call. Lavell explains he decided to lose weight for his family and himself.\n\nHe also opens up about discovering his “dad” wasn’t straight or his biological father and finding his real dad through a private investigator. Lavell talks about landing his role in Breaking Bad and how it changed his comedy career. He shares experiences with crazy fans and working with stars like Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Robin Williams.\n\nEncouraging Shannon to try stand-up, Lavell compares his potential to Steve Austin. Lavell talks about the jealousy some comedians feel toward the success of Adam Sandler, Ray Romano, and Jerry Seinfeld. He addresses Katt Williams' accusations on Club Shay Shay and humorously suggests Shannon make a sex tape to beat allegations sparked by people like Mike Epps. He also discusses being curved by Boosie Badass at the airport.\n\nFinally, Lavell shares his Mount Rushmore of comedians, proudly placing himself among the greats. This episode of Club Shay Shay is a rollercoaster of laughter, personal revelations, and profound insights into the world of comedy and beyond.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #lavellcrawford #shannonsharpe\n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

            "description": "Pound-for-pound great Canelo Álvarez turned in a vintage performance by dropping the previously unbeaten Jaime Munguia Saturday night on his way to earning a unanimous decision as Canelo Promotions presented the all-Mexican clash headlining a PBC Pay-Per-View event on Prime Video from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nMaking the fourth defense of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO 168-pound world titles, Canelo delivered another Cinco de Mayo weekend masterpiece as he took home the decision by scores of 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112. Munguia fought valiantly and was extremely busy in the ring, but Canelo consistently landed the cleaner shots across the 12 rounds.\n \n“This win means a lot,” said Canelo. “I’m glad that I gave him this opportunity. Munguia is a great guy and a great champion. He’s gonna have a great career. I’m very proud that the whole world is watching us Mexicans.”\n \n\"I came out strong and was winning the early rounds,” said Munguia. “I let my hands go, but he’s a fighter with a lot of experience. The loss hurts because it's my first loss and I felt strong.”\n \nMunguia appeared to have the momentum after he closed round three with a right hand that appeared to snap Canelo’s head back. However, Canelo responded like the future Hall of Famer he is and delivered the highlight of the fight in round four with a left hook-uppercut that put Munguia on the mat.\n \n“I took my time,” said Canelo. “I have a lot of experience. Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong and smart. But I have 12 rounds to win the fight and I did. I did really good and I’m proud of it. He’s strong, but he’s a little slow. I could see every punch. That’s why I’m the best.”\n \n\"There’s no doubt I would have beaten anyone else tonight,” said Munguia. “He has a lot of experience. I started well, but he’s a fighter who creates a lot of problems.\"\n \nCanelo rode the momentum from that moment to dominate the final eight rounds on the way to his unanimous decision. While Munguia threw more punches than Canelo according to CompuBox (663-536), it was Canelo who held the edge in shots landed (234-170) and connect rate (44% to 26%).\n \nAfter sweeping the final three rounds on all of the cards, Canelo discussed his place in boxing history and his plans for what comes next.\n \n“When I retire, my numbers will say what position I'm in,” said Canelo. “I know there's a lot of great Mexican fighters in the past, but I’m the best fighting right now. I’m gonna rest and enjoy my family. If the money is right, I can fight right now. I’ve fought everyone and I can do what I want.\"\n\n#CaneloMunguia #Canelo #JaimeMunguia \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",
