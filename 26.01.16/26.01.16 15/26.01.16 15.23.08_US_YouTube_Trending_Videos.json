Nobody could have prepared for what was about to happen next. This is How I Survived the Unstable SMP Purge.\n\nUnstable SMP:\n➜ ‪ @Spokeishere \n➜ ‪ @wemmbumc \n➜ ‪ @FlameFragsMC \n➜ ‪ @ParrotX2 \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable SMP series, where he is escaping Paragon / Proton: Minecraft's Most Secure Prison, or got hunted by a Minecraft Player who doesn't exist. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with Wemmbu, FlameFrags, or Spoke. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @LettuceK @TheobaldTheBird @PurpledMC @fymada @HoraceMinecraft @Boosfer @naparizel \n\nOriginal music by @tsynphonia \n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags tell stories in Minecraft.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

                "description": "ted Season 2 is streaming  March 5 on Peacock, plus catch up on Season 1 streaming now: https://pck.tv/48cuZjq \n\nSynopsis: It’s 1994, and senior year of high school is underway for Ted the foul-mouthed teddy bear and his best friend, likable but awkward John Bennett. Together they live in a working-class Boston home with John's parents (Matty and Susan) and cousin (Blaire). Matty is a blustering, blue-collar Bostonian who sees himself as the unequivocal boss of the house and frequently clashes with his liberal niece. Susan is kind, selfless, and almost pathologically sweet when it comes to caring for her family. Blaire is an outspoken college student who often finds herself at odds with her more traditional-minded relatives.\n\n#Peacock #ted #tedSeason2 #OfficialTrailer\n\nPeacock is your go-to for hit movies, TV, live sports, and more.

For 2026, we’re going bigger: more matches, a new roadshow finals experience for Stage 2, and hosting the first international event of the year with Masters Santiago. As we look ahead to the new season, we say goodbye to some legends but welcome ENVY who will be joining us to show his dominance across Challengers.\nThe road to Champions Shanghai is long, and it all starts with VCT Americas Kickoff, where we’ll get our first look at 12 of the best teams in the world. Step one: conquer Kickoff and grab one of the three tickets to represent the region at Masters Santiago.

                "description": "Tritt meinem Discord-Server bei und verbringe Zeit mit mir und unserer Community! Wir veranstalten außerdem jede Menge Gewinnspiele – NUR auf Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nWir sind ZURÜCK im Casino und nutzen die KRAFT DER POSITIVITÄT, um einen fetten Jackpot direkt auf unser Konto zu manifestieren! Danke fürs Zuschauen! Ich weiß eure Unterstützung auf diesem Weg sehr zu schätzen. Drückt mir die Daumen, und wir sehen uns beim nächsten Mal! Auf geht's!\n\nBrettski betrat das Casino, als würde er schon zum Geldabheben bereit sein. Die Lichter flackerten zustimmend, die Teppiche summten vor Glück, und die Spielautomaten klingelten, als würden sie sich nur für ihn warmlaufen. Er lächelte – nicht hoffnungsvoll, sondern selbstbewusst wie jemand, der sich an die Zukunft erinnerte. Heute Abend, so hatte er beschlossen, würde die positive Einstellung die Wahrscheinlichkeit verändern.\n\nEr saß an einem Spielautomaten namens **Ewiges Glück**, schloss die Augen und malte sich den Jackpot aus – Sirenengeheul, Menschenmassen, sein Name, der wie ein Mythos geflüstert wurde. *Ich habe schon gewonnen*, dachte er. Als er den Hebel zog, drehten sich die Walzen wild … und blieben dann kurz davor stehen. Zwei Goldbarren und eine Kirsche.\n\nBrettski lachte. „Beinahe-Gewinn-Energie“, sagte er gelassen und warf einen weiteren Schein ein.\n\nStunden vergingen. Er verlor, dann noch mehr, dann auf immer poetischere Weise. Doch mit jedem Verlust wuchs sein Glaube. Er begann, mit den Automaten zu sprechen und ihnen im Voraus zu danken. Andere Spieler starrten ihn an, als Brettski Verluste wie Siege feierte.\n\nDann änderte sich etwas.\n\nEin Casino-Manager bemerkte, dass der Automat, an dem Brettski spielte, die ganze Nacht nichts ausgezahlt hatte. Die Lichter darüber flackerten. Brettski zog erneut den Hebel.\n\nDrei Goldbarren.\n\nAlarme heulten auf. Konfetti regnete herab. Das Casino erstarrte. Brettski stand langsam da, die Arme erhoben, und genoss den Moment, von dem er *wusste*, dass er kommen würde. Doch als der Bildschirm neu berechnete, flackerten die Zahlen – die Jackpot-Werte schossen weit über das angegebene Maximum hinaus.\n\nSicherheitskräfte stürmten herein. Der Pitboss brüllte ins Funkgerät. Der Automat spuckte unaufhörlich Tickets aus, als könne er selbst nicht aufhören zu glauben.\n\nBrettskis Lächeln verschwand – nicht aus Angst, sondern aus Erkenntnis.\n\nDas war kein Glück.\n\nDas war keine positive Stimmung.\n\nAls die Lichter im Casino nacheinander ausgingen und der Automat seine Spieler-ID erkannte, bemerkte Brettski etwas Beunruhigendes auf dem Bildschirm:\n\n**„JACKPOT IN BEARBEITUNG – REALITÄTSANPASSUNG LÄUFT.“**\n\nUnd dann fiel der Strom aus.\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski? Brettski ist ein professioneller Spieler, vergleichbar mit den alten Legenden Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot oder Lady Luck HQ! Doch im Gegensatz zu ihnen verfügt Brettski über jahrtausendealtes Wissen, das von den Ältesten überliefert wurde, und beherrscht Fähigkeiten wie Spielautomaten, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker und Baccarat. Brettskis Ziel als professioneller Spieler ist einfach: ganz Las Vegas zu beherrschen – mit dem Geld, das er durch Glücksspiel verdient.

Світло мерехтіло схвально, килими гуділи долею, а ігрові автомати дзвонили, ніби розігріваючись саме для нього. Він посміхнувся — не сповненою надії, а впевненою посмішкою людини, яка *пам'ятала майбутнє*. Сьогодні ввечері, вирішив він, позитивність перевершить ймовірність.\n\nВін сів за ігровий автомат під назвою **Вічна Фортуна**, заплющив очі та уявив собі джекпот — сирени, натовпи, що збираються, його ім'я, що шепотілося, як міф. *Я вже виграв*, подумав він.

Він програвав, потім програвав більше, потім програвав дедалі поетичніше. Але з кожною програшею його віра міцнішала. Він почав розмовляти з автоматами, дякуючи їм заздалегідь.

Світло над ним замерехтіло. Бретцкі знову потягнув за важіль.\n\nТри золоті злитки.\n\nЗакричала сигналізація. Конфетті вибухнуло. Казино завмерло. Бретцкі повільно стояв, піднявши руки, насолоджуючись моментом, який, як він *знав*, настане. Але коли екран перерахувався, цифри збилися — значення джекпотів значно перевищили встановлений максимум.\n\nОхорона вбігла. Босовщик піт-стопу крикнув у рацію. Автомат почав нескінченно викидати квитки, ніби й сам не міг перестати вірити.\n\nПосмішка Бретскі зникла — не від страху, а від усвідомлення.\n\nЦе не була удача.\n\nЦе не був позитив.\n\nКоли світло в казино одне за одним вимикалося, а автомат налаштувався на його ідентифікатор гравця, Бретскі помітив щось моторошне на екрані:\n\n**«ДЖЕКПОТ ОЧІКУЄТЬСЯ — ВІДБУВАЄТЬСЯ НАЛАШТУВАННЯ НА РЕАЛЬНІСТЬ».**\n\nА потім зникло світло.\n\n#слоти #блекджек #азартні ігри #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nХто такий Бретскі? Бретскі — професійний гравець, подібний до давніх легенд Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot або Lady Luck HQ! Однак, на відміну від цих легенд, Бретскі володіє тисячами років накопичених давніх знань, зібраних старійшинами, у таких навичках, як ігрові автомати, рулетка, блекджек, крепс, міхуровий крепс, покер та баккара. Мета Бреттскі як професійного гравця проста: володіти всім Лас-Вегасом, використовуючи кошти, зароблені Gambling. Підпишіться, щоб підтримати його шлях до світового панування."

Il sourit – pas d'un sourire d'espoir, mais du sourire confiant de quelqu'un qui *se souvient de l'avenir*. Ce soir, il l'avait décidé, la positivité allait changer le cours des choses.\n\nIl s'assit devant une machine à sous nommée **Eternal Fortune**, ferma les yeux et imagina le jackpot : les sirènes hurlantes, la foule qui se rassemble, son nom murmuré comme une légende. *J'ai déjà gagné*, pensa-t-il. Lorsqu'il actionna le levier, les rouleaux se mirent à tourner frénétiquement… puis s'arrêtèrent juste avant. Deux lingots d'or et une cerise.\n\nBrettski rit. « L'énergie du presque gagné », dit-il calmement en insérant un autre billet.\n\nLes heures passèrent. Il perdit, puis perdit encore plus, puis perdit de manière de plus en plus poétique. Pourtant, à chaque perte, sa conviction s'intensifiait. Il se mit à parler aux machines, les remerciant d'avance. Les autres joueurs le dévisagèrent tandis que Brettski célébrait ses pertes comme des victoires en devenir.\n\nPuis quelque chose changea.\n\nUn chef de table remarqua que la machine sur laquelle jouait Brettski n'avait rien payé de toute la soirée. Les lumières au-dessus d'elle vacillèrent. Brettski actionna de nouveau le levier.\n\nTrois lingots d'or.\n\nLes alarmes hurlèrent. Des confettis explosèrent. Le casino s'est figé. Brettski s'est levé lentement, les bras levés, savourant l'instant qu'il *savait* imminent. Mais lorsque l'écran a recalculé, les chiffres ont bugué : le jackpot s'est envolé bien au-delà du maximum affiché.\n\nLa sécurité a fait irruption. Le chef de table a crié dans un talkie-walkie. La machine s'est mise à cracher des tickets à la chaîne, comme si elle aussi ne pouvait s'empêcher d'y croire.\n\nLe sourire de Brettski s'est effacé, non pas par peur, mais par la prise de conscience.\n\nCe n'était pas de la chance.\n\nCe n'était pas un signe d'optimisme.\n\nAlors que les lumières du casino s'éteignaient une à une et que la machine enregistrait son identifiant de joueur, Brettski a remarqué quelque chose d'inquiétant sur l'écran :\n\n**« JACKPOT EN COURS – ADAPTATION À LA RÉALITÉ EN COURS. »**\n\nEt puis, plus rien.\n\n#machinesàsous #blackjack #jeuxdargent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ?

Он проигрывал, потом проигрывал покрупнее, потом проигрывал все более поэтичным образом. Но с каждым проигрышем его вера крепла. Он начал разговаривать с автоматами, заранее благодаря их. Другие игроки смотрели, как Бретски праздновал проигрыши, словно победы в процессе.\n\nЗатем что-то изменилось.\n\nОператор игрового зала заметил, что автомат, на котором играл Бретски, не выплачивал выигрыши всю ночь. Лампочки над ним замигали. Бретски снова дернул рычаг.\n\nТри золотых слитка.\n\nЗавыла сигнализация. Взметнулись конфетти. Казино замерло. Бретски медленно поднял руки, наслаждаясь моментом, который, как он *знал*, должен был наступить. Но когда экран пересчитался, цифры дали сбой — значения джекпота взлетели намного выше установленного максимума.\n\nВбежала охрана. Менеджер игрового зала крикнул в рацию. Автомат начал бесконечно выдавать билеты, словно тоже не мог перестать верить.\n\nУлыбка Бретски исчезла — не от страха, а от осознания.\n\nЭто была не удача.\n\nЭто был не позитив.\n\nКогда свет в казино погас один за другим, а автомат зафиксировался на его идентификаторе игрока, Бретски заметил на экране нечто пугающее:\n\n**«ДЖЕКПОТ ОЖИДАЕТСЯ — ПРОИСХОДИТ КОРРЕКЦИЯ РЕАЛЬНОСТИ».**\n\nА затем отключилось электричество.\n\n#слоты #блэкджек #азартныеигрыши #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nКто такой Бретски? Бретски — профессиональный игрок в азартные игры, подобный древним легендам, таким как Вегас Мэтт, Блафф, ДегенДальт, БигДжекпот или Леди Лак! Однако, в отличие от этих легенд, Бретски обладает тысячелетним опытом, накопленным старейшинами, в таких навыках, как игра на игровых автоматах, рулетка, блэкджек, крэпс, баббл-крэпс, покер и баккара. Цель Бретски как профессионального игрока проста: завладеть всем Лас-Вегасом, используя средства, полученные от азартных игр. Подпишитесь, чтобы поддержать его путь к мировому господству."

                "description": "Word lid van mijn Discord-server om met mij en onze community te chatten! We organiseren ook regelmatig giveaways, exclusief op Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nWe zijn TERUG in het casino en we gebruiken de KRACHT van POSITIVITEIT om een ​​gigantische jackpot rechtstreeks op onze bankrekening te manifesteren! Bedankt voor het kijken! Ik waardeer ieders steun op deze reis enorm. Wens me succes en tot de volgende keer! Laten we de strijd aangaan!\n\nBrettski liep het casino binnen alsof hij al klaar was om te cashen. De lichten flikkerden goedkeurend, de tapijten zoemden van het lot en de gokautomaten rinkelden alsof ze speciaal voor hem opwarmden. Hij glimlachte – niet de hoopvolle glimlach, maar de zelfverzekerde glimlach van iemand die *de toekomst niet vergat*. Vanavond, had hij besloten, zou positiviteit de kansen buigen.\n\nHij zat achter een gokautomaat genaamd **Eeuwig Geluk**, sloot zijn ogen en fantaseerde over de jackpot: loeiende sirenes, een menigte die zich verzamelde, zijn naam die als een mythe werd gefluisterd. *Ik heb al gewonnen,* dacht hij. Toen hij aan de hendel trok, draaiden de rollen wild rond... en stopten net voor de jackpot. Twee goudstaven en een kers.\n\nBrettski lachte. \"Bijna-winst-energie,\" zei hij kalm, terwijl hij er nog een biljet in gooide.\n\nUren verstreken. Hij verloor, verloor steeds meer, en verloor op steeds poëtischer wijze. Maar met elk verlies werd zijn geloof sterker. Hij begon tegen de machines te praten en ze bij voorbaat te bedanken. Andere gokkers staarden toe hoe Brettski zijn verliezen vierde alsof het overwinningen in wording waren.\n\nToen veranderde er iets.\n\nEen croupier merkte op dat de machine waar Brettski op speelde de hele avond nog niets had uitbetaald. De lampen erboven flikkerden. Brettski trok opnieuw aan de hendel.\n\nDrie goudstaven.\n\nDe alarmen loeiden. Confetti explodeerde. Het casino stond even stil. Brettski stond langzaam op, met zijn armen omhoog, genietend van het moment waarvan hij *wist* dat het eraan kwam. Maar toen het scherm de cijfers opnieuw berekende, haperden ze – de jackpotwaarden stegen ver boven het aangegeven maximum.\n\nDe beveiliging stormde naar binnen. De pitbaas schreeuwde in de radio. De machine begon eindeloos loten uit te spuwen, alsof hij er zelf ook niet meer in kon ophouden.\n\nBrettski's glimlach verdween – niet van angst, maar van besef.\n\nDit was geen geluk.\n\nDit was geen positiviteit.\n\nTerwijl de casinolichten één voor één uitgingen en de machine zijn spelers-ID herkende, zag Brettski iets huiveringwekkends op het scherm:\n\n**\"JACKPOT IN AFWACHTING – REALITEITSAANPASSING BEZIG.\"**\n\nEn toen viel de stroom uit.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski? Brettski is een professionele gokker, net als de oude legendes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot of Lady Luck HQ! In tegenstelling tot deze legendes beschikt Brettski echter over duizenden jaren aan opgeslagen, eeuwenoude kennis, verzameld door de ouderen, op het gebied van spellen zoals gokkasten, roulette, blackjack, craps, bubble craps, poker en baccarat. Brettski's doel als professionele gokker is simpel: heel Las Vegas bezitten met het geld dat hij met gokken verdient. Abonneer je om zijn reis naar wereldheerschappij te steunen."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",
