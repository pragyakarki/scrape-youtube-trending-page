He reflects on getting into trouble, joining a gang, and the influence of his sister Brandy’s big break with her first album.\n\nHe shares his early realization of Pharrell Williams’ talent and working with various A-list celebrities as a child. He reminisces about being spoiled as a kid, receiving a Cadillac at 14, and his experiences with his cousin, Snoop Dogg. He discusses attending private school after getting jumped at public school and his mother managing both his and Brandy’s careers. Ray J delves into the growing distance between him and Brandy due to his actions, and his encounters with Michael Jackson, facilitated by Brandy.\n\nRay J addresses Vince Staples’ comments about him being a top 5 West Coast rapper, shares his top 5 West Coast artists, and discusses the current state of West Coast rap with artists like YG and Kendrick Lamar. He gives his take on the Kendrick vs. Drake and Chris Brown vs. Quavo beef and his diss song with Chris Brown aimed at Kanye West.\n\nRay J candidly talks about his need for reality shows to assess his personal growth, feeling blackballed in the industry, and the process of Shaq investing $1.5M into his music. He explains why he became an independent artist, what he wishes he knew as a younger artist, and his admiration for Chris Brown’s career.\n\nHe talks about the incredible success of Raycon, earning $80M a year for four years, and his involvement in TV networks, including a show featuring BlueFace and Chrisean Rock on his broadcast network.

                "description": "Ray J joins Shannon Sharpe for an engaging episode of Club Shay Shay, sharing an in-depth look into his multifaceted life and career. Ray J opens up about his upbringing, moving from Mississippi to Compton, and the challenges he faced, including his father driving him from Carson to Hollywood auditions and his dislike for choir rehearsals. He reflects on getting into trouble, joining a gang, and the influence of his sister Brandy’s big break with her first album.\n\nHe shares his early realization of Pharrell Williams’ talent and working with various A-list celebrities as a child. He reminisces about being spoiled as a kid, receiving a Cadillac at 14, and his experiences with his cousin, Snoop Dogg. He discusses attending private school after getting jumped at public school and his mother managing both his and Brandy’s careers. Ray J delves into the growing distance between him and Brandy due to his actions, and his encounters with Michael Jackson, facilitated by Brandy.\n\nRay J addresses Vince Staples’ comments about him being a top 5 West Coast rapper, shares his top 5 West Coast artists, and discusses the current state of West Coast rap with artists like YG and Kendrick Lamar. He gives his take on the Kendrick vs. Drake and Chris Brown vs. Quavo beef and his diss song with Chris Brown aimed at Kanye West.\n\nRay J candidly talks about his need for reality shows to assess his personal growth, feeling blackballed in the industry, and the process of Shaq investing $1.5M into his music. He explains why he became an independent artist, what he wishes he knew as a younger artist, and his admiration for Chris Brown’s career.\n\nHe talks about the incredible success of Raycon, earning $80M a year for four years, and his involvement in TV networks, including a show featuring BlueFace and Chrisean Rock on his broadcast network. Ray J opens up about his relationship with 50 Cent and shares his views on why celebrities often date the same people.\n\nRay J candidly discusses his complex personal relationships, including stealing his ex, Princess, from Floyd Mayweather and the ensuing conflict. He talks about his preference for older women and how one helped cleanse him during his teenage years. He also touches on his tumultuous marriage with Princess, expressing his intent to never date again but only \"slay,\" and explains the recurring issues between them.\n\nRay J recounts his initial meeting with Kim Kardashian when she was Brandy's closet designer, their subsequent relationship, and the infamous tape. He acknowledges the tape's profitability but also reflects on the embarrassment it caused, especially now that he has children. He discusses the success of the Kardashians and speculates on how different the world might be if the tape had never surfaced.\n\nHis relationship with Kanye West comes up, highlighting a unique gift from Kanye—a Balenciaga straight jacket. Ray J mentions he no longer has anyone he wants to fight in a celebrity boxing match but is open to the idea of doing OnlyFans. He shares memories of attending parties at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion at just 16 years old.\n\nFinally, Ray J speaks on the legal troubles faced by his friends R. Kelly and Diddy, expressing the personal pain he felt as they went down. Join Shannon Sharpe and Ray J for an episode brimming with revelations, humor, and the candid truth behind Ray J's headline-making life.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #RayJ #ShannonSharpe\n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

            "description": "Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” opens in theaters nationwide in just 10 days, inviting moviegoers inside the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as Headquarters undergoes a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions. Check out an all-new trailer and feel free to share.  \n \nIn the follow-up to 2015’s Oscar®-winning “Inside Out,” Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust—who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts—aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety, Envy, Ennui and Embarrassment show up. The voice cast includes Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman, Liza Lapira, Tony Hale, Lewis Black, Phyllis Smith, Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Adèle Exarchopoulos, Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan, Paul Walter Hauser and Yvette Nicole Brown. “Inside Out 2” is directed by Kelsey Mann, produced by Mark Nielsen and executive produced by Pete Docter, Jonas Rivera and Dan Scanlon. The film features a screenplay by Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein and story by Mann and LeFauve. With music by Andrea Datzman, the all-new feature film releases only in theaters June 14, 2024.\n\nPixar Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixar/\r\nPixar Twitter: https://twitter.com/pixar\r\nPixar Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pixar\r\n \r\nCopyright: (C) Disney•Pixar",

                "description": "Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” opens in theaters nationwide in just 10 days, inviting moviegoers inside the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as Headquarters undergoes a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions. Check out an all-new trailer and feel free to share.  \n \nIn the follow-up to 2015’s Oscar®-winning “Inside Out,” Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust—who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts—aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety, Envy, Ennui and Embarrassment show up. The voice cast includes Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman, Liza Lapira, Tony Hale, Lewis Black, Phyllis Smith, Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Adèle Exarchopoulos, Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan, Paul Walter Hauser and Yvette Nicole Brown. “Inside Out 2” is directed by Kelsey Mann, produced by Mark Nielsen and executive produced by Pete Docter, Jonas Rivera and Dan Scanlon. The film features a screenplay by Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein and story by Mann and LeFauve. With music by Andrea Datzman, the all-new feature film releases only in theaters June 14, 2024.\n\nPixar Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixar/\r\nPixar Twitter: https://twitter.com/pixar\r\nPixar Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pixar\r\n \r\nCopyright: (C) Disney•Pixar"

In this analog horror series we learned how during the filming of the first Godzilla movie, there was an incident where the actor of Godzilla merged with the suit. This caused a chain of events where Godzillas actor began biting and transforming his enemies in the movies into merged suit people just like him. In todays video we learn about someone who will try to stop him from doing it again. And this time Godzillas target is King Ghidorah. Will our mc be able to prevent another suit incident? Or will this plan go horribly wrong?\n\nMy previous video on The Man In The Suit:\nhttps://youtu.be/0A6HbKsAg_o\n\n0:00 Intro \n1:00 Recap\n6:08 Seven Updates\n16:37 Ghidorah Suit Incident\n26:56 Thoughts/Theories\n29:50 Outro\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n➤ BECOME A MEMBER HERE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUI0i5-4t4AWgenu9TFZ0aw/join\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n🥤Check out GAMERSUPPS 🥤\nuse code 'EMORTAL' to get 10% OFF\nhttps://gamersupps.gg/emortal \n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/BxXkstgPdH\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/emortalmarcus\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/emortalmarcus/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@emortalmarcus​\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nAll music is from Epidemic Sound",

                "description": "Unknowingly's Channel:  @Unkn0wingly \n\nIn todays video we are back looking at the GODZILLA analog horror series called The Man In The Suit. In this analog horror series we learned how during the filming of the first Godzilla movie, there was an incident where the actor of Godzilla merged with the suit. This caused a chain of events where Godzillas actor began biting and transforming his enemies in the movies into merged suit people just like him. In todays video we learn about someone who will try to stop him from doing it again. And this time Godzillas target is King Ghidorah. Will our mc be able to prevent another suit incident? Or will this plan go horribly wrong?\n\nMy previous video on The Man In The Suit:\nhttps://youtu.be/0A6HbKsAg_o\n\n0:00 Intro \n1:00 Recap\n6:08 Seven Updates\n16:37 Ghidorah Suit Incident\n26:56 Thoughts/Theories\n29:50 Outro\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n➤ BECOME A MEMBER HERE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUI0i5-4t4AWgenu9TFZ0aw/join\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\n🥤Check out GAMERSUPPS 🥤\nuse code 'EMORTAL' to get 10% OFF\nhttps://gamersupps.gg/emortal \n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/BxXkstgPdH\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/emortalmarcus\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/emortalmarcus/\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@emortalmarcus​\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nAll music is from Epidemic Sound"

Go inside the building to witness behind-the-scenes moments with new Head Coach, Dave Canales, General Manager, Dan Morgan & their coaching staff. Episode 1 captures the new, positive culture that Dave Canales has brought into Bank of America Stadium as well as spotlighting the pride that Dan Morgan has for the organization and his laser focus on bringing the Panthers back to winning ways. \n\nAn important piece of the puzzle for Dave Canales is not just retaining Derrick Brown as Carolina's best performing defensive player, but keeping an entire defensive staff led by defensive coordinator, Ejiro Evero. We also follow new offensive coordinator Brad Idzik & offensive line coach Joe Gilbert on the practice field to understand more of the offensive philosophy. The episode shows the emphasis for quarterback Bryce Young to get the ball out quickly, and how it takes everyone on offense to achieve this goal.\n\nJoin the Conversation: What are your thoughts on the first episode of this year’s Panthers Blueprint?

            "description": "I can hardly put into words what it feels like to finally achieve my lifelong dream of winning the Monaco Grand Prix. Growing up on the streets of Monaco, I often imagined what this day would look like, but I could never truly grasp how it would feel. This victory means more to me than I can express. It didn't come easy, but this year, my dream came true.\n\nIn this special episode, I will take you behind the scenes of this unforgettable race weekend, one that I always experience at home with all my family and friends nearby.\n\nCrossing that finish line, knowing I had achieved what my father and I had dreamt of since I was a child, was a moment I’ll never forget. This isn’t just a win for me—it’s a triumph for every Monegasque who has watched my journey and cheered me on.\n\nHere's to more.

            "description": "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.\n\nBobby Carter | June 3, 2024\nTo hear Tems tell the audience that she was shy came as a surprise to me. As a performer, she captivates us with such ease and exudes confidence when she’s not, so to see her blushing as the crowd roared was sweet to witness. Unlike most artists who’ve performed at the Desk, the Nigerian singer-songwriter took a chance by playing a set filled with songs from her forthcoming debut album, Born in the Wild.\n\nA lot has happened in Tems’ world since her Tiny Desk (home) concert a couple of years ago. She’s won dozens of awards including a Grammy, worked with Beyoncé and written for Rihanna, all of which helped to keep her name on our minds and music in the clubs. These new songs indicate time well spent between her breakout moment a few years ago and now. “Unfortunate” is less Afrobeats and more straightforward R&B, flexing her development as a writer. “Forever” is powerful in the way she reaches a vocal range I had no idea she could, while “Love Me JeJe” was the hands-down standout. At the time of the taping, the song had yet to be released, but the rhythm pierced the room and had us all in line for the call and response.\n\nSET LIST\n“Me & U”\n“Ice T”\n“Unfortunate”\n“Forever”\n“Love Me JeJe”\n\nMUSICIANS\nTems: lead vocals\nDaniel Crawford: keys, music direction\nBrett Baker: percussion\nErick Walls: guitar\nEric Ingram: bass\nRobert Johnson: drums\nOlivia Williams: vocals\nAshly Williams: vocals\nKadeem Nichols: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter \nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josephine Nyounai\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Alanté Serene, Mitra I.

An international star has signed for the European champions, who, at the age of 25, has just enjoyed his highest scoring season with Paris Saint-Germain (44 goals) and has finished as top scorer of the French league for the sixth consecutive season (27 goals).\n\nThe Whites have strengthened their squad with a top striker, captain of the French national team, with whom he won the World Cup in 2018 and the Nations League in 2021, for which he scored the winning goal. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Mbappé claimed the Golden Boot with 8 goals and, after his hat-trick in the final, became the all-time top scorer in World Cup finals (4).\nMbappé is Paris Saint-Germain's all-time leading scorer with 256 goals, and this season he has won the league title, the French Cup and the French Super Cup. In seven years at the French club, he has amassed 17 trophies: League (6), French Cup (4), French Super Cup (5) and League Cup (2).\n#WelcomeMbappé\n\n\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT",

            "description": "Download Opera Browser for free at https://opr.as/05-Opera-Browser-SafiyaNygaard! Thanks again to Opera for sponsoring this video 🕺🏻\n\nA couple of quick notes!!\n \nWe do think that our results with the ULV light sprayer with only water could have been coincidental - as it ~was~ a pretty small sample size. Probably the answer there is that it definitely works... if you put disinfectant in it!\n\nMost of these products (or at least some version of them) are also sold on Amazon and AliExpress - however, we wanted to purchase the products from the websites linked to from the tiktok accounts just to \"take them at face value\" and try out the products that they were selling specifically!\n\nAlso, I said \"RIP Tyler\" because he is a sixers fan and they lost this year - other than that, Tyler is fine!!\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! So... has anyone else stumbled upon this side of tiktok... you know the one... the semi-surreal, thousands-of-tiny-packages, smart-home-gadget, ASMR-cleaning-tok? And no I'm not just trying to optimize this description with keywords - that's actually how I would describe it. Well, I've been over there for a couple of *years*, in the land of blue light sprayers, weird bluetooth speakers thrown into buckets of water with live crabs, and shoe dryers everywhere. So I finally gave in and tracked down 4 different smart home gadgets from various somewhat-suspicious looking websites. \n\nSo we tested out the smart window roomba, the ULV blue light sprayer, the fruit and vegetable cleaner, and the collapsible mini washing machine - and tried to figure out, to the best of our ability, what the heck is going on here. What did you guys think of these viral TikTok cleaning products? And what should we investigate next?? \n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com \n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@tylerwilliams \nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/@safiyashorts\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nExecutive Producers: Safiya Nygaard & Tyler Williams\nProduction Manager / Producer: Melissa Douglas\nJunior Associate Producer: Ishara Mathews\nContent Promotions & Video Packaging Manager: Alaina Simmons\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Mandy Padgett\nEditor: Hailey Cox\nGraphic Designer: Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n3:48 A Deep Dive into the ~Genre~\n5:45 How do I buy any of these things?\n7:45 Buying Our ULV Light Sprayer\n9:13 Getting Our Produce Cleaning Device\n10:23 Ordering Our Mini Washing Machine\n11:58 Final Item To Get: Smart Window Cleaner\n13:18 The Goods Have Arrived!\n14:46 Trying Out Our Hobot Robot\n18:24 Trying out our ULV sprayer\n23:18 Testing the mysterious Fruit & Vegetable Cleaner\n28:13 Last Item: The Collapsible Washing Machine\n32:36 Some of our findings & ~receipts~\n\n#cleaning #viral #vlog",

There's tonnes of spider-man easter eggs, lots of things going on and we'll be going over it all in this breakdown. Now last week Cris from 3c Films went over a big plot leak he'd received on the movie.\n\nThis came from a film survey on a screening asking how excited people were and weren't for certain elements.\n\nFor this video I am gonna talk about them and though it doesn't spoil things like the deaths, ending or whether Madam Web finally says the name Peter Parker there may still be things that spoil the movie for you.\n\nI think going through these leaks gives a lot of content to what the movies about but yeah, you might not wanna know.\n\nThis is of course still the Sony, show things that arent in the movie in the trailers universe so even with these details things could end up chaging.\n\nLooking at you murderer poster in Morbius trailer.\n\nEither way we last saw Venom being taken to the MCU at the end of Let There Be Carnage.\n\nUpon tapping into the hive mind that the symbiotes possessed he then became aware that peter parker was spiderman. This took into the MCU as Doctor Strange was carrying out the spell. From here he sat at a bar at the hotel which...yep...great use of the character guys, glad we waited for years to see Peter Parker and Venom interacting.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/",

There's tonnes of spider-man easter eggs, lots of things going on and we'll be going over it all in this breakdown. Now last week Cris from 3c Films went over a big plot leak he'd received on the movie.\n\nThis came from a film survey on a screening asking how excited people were and weren't for certain elements.\n\nFor this video I am gonna talk about them and though it doesn't spoil things like the deaths, ending or whether Madam Web finally says the name Peter Parker there may still be things that spoil the movie for you.\n\nI think going through these leaks gives a lot of content to what the movies about but yeah, you might not wanna know.\n\nThis is of course still the Sony, show things that arent in the movie in the trailers universe so even with these details things could end up chaging.\n\nLooking at you murderer poster in Morbius trailer.\n\nEither way we last saw Venom being taken to the MCU at the end of Let There Be Carnage.\n\nUpon tapping into the hive mind that the symbiotes possessed he then became aware that peter parker was spiderman. This took into the MCU as Doctor Strange was carrying out the spell. From here he sat at a bar at the hotel which...yep...great use of the character guys, glad we waited for years to see Peter Parker and Venom interacting.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/"

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Next2U #Kehlani",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Next2U #Kehlani"

            "description": "Bobby Carter | May 31, 2024\nThe vibrancy that bounces off the screen while watching Sean Paul’s Tiny Desk concert is undeniable. Hearing his voice just a few feet away was an overwhelming experience, and I overheard a few NPR staffers in attendance who agreed. “He sounds just like the record!” they said, moving like nobody was watching. Admittedly, we don’t host enough dancehall artists at the Tiny Desk so there was an element of surprise at play. But the Jamaican superstar’s catalog boasts some of the world's biggest party anthems; it should've been a no-brainer when working with that. “This ain’t no Tiny Desk no more,” Paul said as he strutted to the Desk, preparing to turn the office into a bashment party.\n\nPaul took reggae and dancehall to new heights in the early 2000s. After hopping on any and every riddim for the clubs and dropping his debut, Stage One, the breakthrough came with his second album, Dutty Rock, in 2002. The global reach of that album shifted the music industry and everyone from the biggest pop star to the grimiest emcee needed the Sean Paul effect on their albums. For his set, the game plan was simple, all gas and no breaks; energetic hit after hit including “Gimme the Light”, “Get Busy,” “Like Glue” and topping things off with “Temperature.”\n\nSET LIST\n“Gimme the Light”\n“Get Busy”\n“Infiltrate”\n“I'm Still in Love With You”\n“Deport Them”\n“Like Glue”\n“Temperature”\n\nMUSICIANS\nSean “Sean Paul” Henriques: lead vocals\nNigel A.
