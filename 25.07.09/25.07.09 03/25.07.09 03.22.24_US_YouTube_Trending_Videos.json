This video has been in the works for a long time, and I hope everyone can watch in it's entirety. Nearly three years ago I inadvertently quit my main platform where I was making content, and ever since then, I’ve been working on a lot of projects which I am incredibly proud of.\n\nToday, I want to announce my biggest project yet.\n\nDababel.\n\nThis is a project which I hold very dear to my heart, not because of what it is, but because of what it represents to me. I was born and raised in Mexico, my native language is Spanish - and this gave me the opportunity to experience what it was like to be in another country and not know the language. Throughout my life and my career I’ve noticed how prevalent language barriers are - no matter where you are. And Dababel is a project with the objective to help people move beyond this barrier, which has existed since the beginning of time.\n\nThis is a project for you. This is a project for everyone.\n\nDABABEL IS FOR THE WORLD. \n\nThank you for all the support, and I hope you enjoy Dababel. To my global communities, to my new viewers and old, thank you for everything!",

This video has been in the works for a long time, and I hope everyone can watch in it's entirety. Nearly three years ago I inadvertently quit my main platform where I was making content, and ever since then, I’ve been working on a lot of projects which I am incredibly proud of.\n\nToday, I want to announce my biggest project yet.\n\nDababel.\n\nThis is a project which I hold very dear to my heart, not because of what it is, but because of what it represents to me. I was born and raised in Mexico, my native language is Spanish - and this gave me the opportunity to experience what it was like to be in another country and not know the language. Throughout my life and my career I’ve noticed how prevalent language barriers are - no matter where you are. And Dababel is a project with the objective to help people move beyond this barrier, which has existed since the beginning of time.\n\nThis is a project for you. This is a project for everyone.\n\nDABABEL IS FOR THE WORLD. \n\nThank you for all the support, and I hope you enjoy Dababel. To my global communities, to my new viewers and old, thank you for everything!"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."

This massive event was a monumental celebration of Ozzy Osborne and Black Sabbath, featuring a \"who's who\" of rock royalty.

He jumped in, completely lost in the moment, joining the mosh pit for Pantera's entire performance of \"Hostel.\" Eyewitnesses saw him hugging fans and taking selfies – a true testament to his love for the music.

            "description": "Astronomers have just spotted something really strange moving through our solar system — and it seems to be coming our way. This mysterious object is believed to have come from outside our solar system, making it possibly only the third known interstellar visitor ever discovered.\n\nIt’s currently being called 3I/ATLAS, and it was first seen in data collected between June 25 and June 29 by a system called ATLAS — the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. This system uses powerful telescopes in Hawaii and South Africa to scan the night sky automatically for any unusual or potentially dangerous space objects.\nAfter the object was noticed, it was confirmed by experts at NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies and the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center. That means it’s not just a glitch or mistake — this thing is real.\n\nWhat makes 3I/ATLAS so fascinating is its strange speed and unknown nature. Scientists still aren’t sure what it actually is — it could be a comet, an asteroid, or maybe even something we’ve never seen before. One well-known astronomer, Avi Loeb from Harvard University — who famously suggested that ‘Oumuamua might have been an alien probe — has weighed in again. This time, he’s suggesting that scientists use the powerful James Webb Space Telescope to study this newly discovered interstellar object in more detail.\n\n#interstellarobjects #oumuamua #2IBorisov #3IATLAS #interstellarvisitors #asteroid #comets #alien",

                "description": "Astronomen haben gerade etwas wirklich Seltsames entdeckt, das sich durch unser Sonnensystem bewegt – und es scheint auf uns zuzukommen. Dieses mysteriöse Objekt stammt vermutlich von außerhalb unseres Sonnensystems und ist möglicherweise erst der dritte bekannte interstellare Besucher, der jemals entdeckt wurde.\n\nEs trägt derzeit die Bezeichnung 3I/ATLAS und wurde erstmals in Daten beobachtet, die zwischen dem 25. und 29. Juni von einem System namens ATLAS – dem Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System – gesammelt wurden. Dieses System nutzt leistungsstarke Teleskope auf Hawaii und Südafrika, um den Nachthimmel automatisch nach ungewöhnlichen oder potenziell gefährlichen Weltraumobjekten abzusuchen.\nNachdem das Objekt entdeckt worden war, wurde es von Experten des Center for Near-Earth Object Studies der NASA und des Minor Planet Center der Internationalen Astronomischen Union bestätigt. Das bedeutet, dass es sich nicht nur um eine Störung oder einen Fehler handelt – das Ding ist real.\n\nWas 3I/ATLAS so faszinierend macht, ist seine ungewöhnliche Geschwindigkeit und seine unbekannte Natur. Wissenschaftler sind sich noch immer nicht sicher, was es genau ist – es könnte ein Komet, ein Asteroid oder vielleicht sogar etwas völlig Neues sein. Avi Loeb, ein bekannter Astronom von der Harvard University, der bekanntlich vermutete, dass es sich bei ʻOumuamua um eine außerirdische Sonde gehandelt haben könnte, meldet sich erneut zu Wort. Dieses Mal schlägt er vor, das leistungsstarke James-Webb-Weltraumteleskop zu nutzen, um dieses neu entdeckte interstellare Objekt genauer zu untersuchen."

Il ne s'agit donc pas d'un simple bug ou d'une erreur : il s'agit bel et bien d'un phénomène réel.\n\nCe qui rend 3I/ATLAS si fascinant, c'est sa vitesse étrange et sa nature inconnue.

System ten wykorzystuje potężne teleskopy na Hawajach i w Republice Południowej Afryki do automatycznego skanowania nocnego nieba w poszukiwaniu nietypowych lub potencjalnie niebezpiecznych obiektów kosmicznych.\nPo zauważeniu obiektu eksperci z Centrum Badań Obiektów Bliskich Ziemi NASA i Centrum Małych Planet Międzynarodowej Unii Astronomicznej potwierdzili jego obecność. Oznacza to, że nie jest to tylko usterka lub pomyłka — ta rzecz jest prawdziwa.\n\nTo, co sprawia, że ​​3I/ATLAS jest tak fascynujący, to jego dziwna prędkość i nieznana natura.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard."

I started by re-building the blower housing from the last project which had broken after getting wet. Then I set up the blower and tested a fixed pulley wheel that was held in place with a different configuration to the pulley wheels from the last project, where the pulley was outside of 2 stakes as opposed to between to stakes, in order to allow a crank handle to be attached directly to the wheel instead of to the rotor. But it had issues with durability so I decided to test the \"floating\" pulley wheel method I developed last time where the pulley has 2 handles and is held in the hands only with no support frame, spokes or hub of the fixed wheel design. The great reduction in parts makes it simpler and less likely to fail. It worked satisfactorily pushing about the same air as the \"one way spinning rope stick blower\" method and the \"2 way spinning blower method\" but with more even air flow. It gave a slightly above average yield of 21 g of cast iron prills from 1200g of ore as opposed to the normal 15 g from 1200g. This is despite the wood preheat phase of the furnace only being 25 minutes as opposed to 1 hour, preheating the furnace may be important to get the furnace to temperature before adding the charcoal and in future I'll do it for longer. Using the floating wheel isn't as tiring as I thought it might be and is comparable to the rope stick method and is much easier than the 2 way spinning method where a rope has to pulled outwards with two hands repeatedly. It is currently a good competitor to the rope stick method. However, if I want to scale up the wheel size and consequently rpm of the fan, I'll need to revisit the fixed wheel design as the floating wheel won't scale up. Overall, I see this method as a stepping stone to a better blower and better smelts in future.\n\n00:00-05:18 New blower housing\n05:18-06:51 Set up blower and furnace\n06:51-08:50 Banana fibre belt & splicing\n08:50-10:14 Little clay pulleys\n10:14-11:33 Testing a fixed pulley design\n11:33- 12:29 Making and testing floating pulley design\n12:29-14:09 Replace clay pulleys with fibre wrapped rotor/test\n14:09- 14:37 Smelt preparations\n14:37- 17:39 Smelt\n17:39- 19:09 Process bloom\n19:09- 19:48 Result\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",
