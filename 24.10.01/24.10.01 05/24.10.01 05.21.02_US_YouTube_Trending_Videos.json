Power stations and a port were hit in Ras Isa and Hudaydah.\n\nThe strikes came as Israel carried out more attacks across Lebanon, and Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel.   Israel has again targeted the Beirut suburb of Dahieh, the Hezbollah stronghold where its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed by Israeli bombing.

Click\nhttps://betterhelp.com/eamonandbec for a discount on your first month of therapy.\n\nSubscribe to Reroot our podcast channel to watch weekly chats between Eamon & Bec:\n@RerootwithEamonandBec \n\nWe're thrilled to be announcing season 3 of our podcast Reroot!!! Reroot is a safe space for us to have deep meaningful conversations between the two of us and with people who inspire us! Coming back to this project we knew we wanted to invest more energy into it so we needed to begin with a proper studio space for recording episodes and hosting guests. Today's video begins with a property hunt (we need approximately 750 sq-ft, great audio and natural light). We also want to be walking distance from home for ease and flexibility of life with our sweet baby girl Frankie. The second piece of the puzzle is that we want to be able to shoot content for Habit (our tea company) from this space. So, it needs to be big enough for our content creators to come in and have the room to create too!\nOnce we secure a location, we get to work learning how to set up a studio (something we know nothing about 😜 ).\n\nSpeaking of Habit, our fall teas are BACK and we've created a really special bundle when you buy all four. Check it out here: https://drinkhabit.com/\n\nRead below for a podcast description:\n\n🥰 We're ‪@eamonandbec‬ ! We’ve cultivated a community of 1M+ on YouTube, created Habit, and most importantly became new parents to Frankie Lee. Our lives have changed immensely in these past few years but through it all, our roots have deepened.\nWhile we've always shown up authentically online, there’s so much more of us that we want to share with our community. Reroot is a safe space where we explore the essence of who we are as individuals. As seekers of community, we hope this podcast continues to be an extension of our mission to foster open, healthy conversations.\n\nJoin the community 💛\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/rerootpod/\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@rerootpod\n\n\nIf you have questions about the brand relating to how the therapists are\ncredentialed, their privacy policy, or therapist compensation, here is an overview written by the YouTube creators behind the channel Cinema Therapy that goes into these topics:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cinema_therapy/comments/1dpriql/addressing_the_betterhelp_concerns_headon_deep/",

Click\nhttps://betterhelp.com/eamonandbec for a discount on your first month of therapy.\n\nSubscribe to Reroot our podcast channel to watch weekly chats between Eamon & Bec:\n@RerootwithEamonandBec \n\nWe're thrilled to be announcing season 3 of our podcast Reroot!!! Reroot is a safe space for us to have deep meaningful conversations between the two of us and with people who inspire us! Coming back to this project we knew we wanted to invest more energy into it so we needed to begin with a proper studio space for recording episodes and hosting guests. Today's video begins with a property hunt (we need approximately 750 sq-ft, great audio and natural light). We also want to be walking distance from home for ease and flexibility of life with our sweet baby girl Frankie. The second piece of the puzzle is that we want to be able to shoot content for Habit (our tea company) from this space. So, it needs to be big enough for our content creators to come in and have the room to create too!\nOnce we secure a location, we get to work learning how to set up a studio (something we know nothing about 😜 ).\n\nSpeaking of Habit, our fall teas are BACK and we've created a really special bundle when you buy all four. Check it out here: https://drinkhabit.com/\n\nRead below for a podcast description:\n\n🥰 We're ‪@eamonandbec‬ ! We’ve cultivated a community of 1M+ on YouTube, created Habit, and most importantly became new parents to Frankie Lee. Our lives have changed immensely in these past few years but through it all, our roots have deepened.\nWhile we've always shown up authentically online, there’s so much more of us that we want to share with our community. Reroot is a safe space where we explore the essence of who we are as individuals. As seekers of community, we hope this podcast continues to be an extension of our mission to foster open, healthy conversations.\n\nJoin the community 💛\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/rerootpod/\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@rerootpod\n\n\nIf you have questions about the brand relating to how the therapists are\ncredentialed, their privacy policy, or therapist compensation, here is an overview written by the YouTube creators behind the channel Cinema Therapy that goes into these topics:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cinema_therapy/comments/1dpriql/addressing_the_betterhelp_concerns_headon_deep/"

            "title": "Understanding Porsche's New Six Stroke Engine Patent",
            "description": "Support the channel by shopping through this link: https://amzn.to/3RIqU0u\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/d4a\nBecome a member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwosUnVH6AINmxtqkNJ3Fbg/join\nGrit: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3YSIPcvJsYbwGCDLNiIKA\nLink to the patent: https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/18585308/ifw/docs?application=\n\nJust a few days ago news has surfaced on the internet that Porsche has patented a revolutionary new six stroke engine which according to them has the power benefits of a two stroke engine but the durabtility and emissions cleanliness of a four stroke engine. \n\nAs you probably know traditional four stroke engines which powers virtually every combustion car, truck or motorcycle on the roads today gooes intake, compression, combustion and exhaust.\n\nPorsche new design adds one more combustion and more compression stroke into the mix and so the new engine goes: intake compression combustion compression combustion exhaust. \n\nThis relies on 100% existing technology. Gears, rod, crank, piston. Even the ports which are known as scavenging ports are ancient. Btw, this very arrangement with ports on one side and valves on the other is known as uniflow scavenging. Because the flow goes in a uniform direction through the cylinder. And this is very common on two stroke diesels in ships and locomotives. The six stroke also don’t make any serious problems for the camshafts. Instead of rotating at half the crankshaft speed, the camshafts will now rotate at one-third the crankshaft speed, so we just need a slightly larger cam gear and we also need an additional lobe on the exhaust come and that’s pretty much it, nothing complex. So there are really no novel mechanics in this which means that it doesn’t need heavy investments into research and development to get it to market. \n\nIt does make more power than a traditional four-stroke. If we observe the first 720 degrees of rotation we can see that we get only one combustion event, just like a traditional four-stroke. But if we observe the next 360 degrees we will see another combustion event starting at 720 degrees of rotation. This does not happen in the traditional four-stroke until we reach 1080 degrees of rotation.\n\nSo if we observe let’s say 7200 degrees of rotation, the traditional four-stroke will perform 10 combustion events. The six stroke will perform  13.34 combustion events. So that’s 33.4% more power than a traditional four-stroke. Now, it’s definitely not in two-stroke territory because a two stroke will perform 20 combustion events in 7200 degrees of rotation and that’s 20 equal, proper combustion events. Remember, on the six stroke, every other combustion event is a mix of exhaust gas and air and fuel which means that we’re probably not looking at a power increase of 33.4% but likely something closer to 25%. But 25% more power with existing technology and emissions cleanliness and durability of a traditional four stroke is still a very significant improvement and a very clever and rational way towards more power. \nSomething else this makes possible is to run very high boost pressure and still be relatively emissions-friendly. To run something like 3 bar boost pressure which is 45 psi you need to run very very rich. You make crazy power but you’re also sending some unburned fuel into the atmosphere which means crappy emissions. But in a six-stroke we would not send all that unburned fuel out. We would send just a bit of it out and the rest would be burned during the next combustion stroke. So potentially, big power and government approval. \n\n\nBut why would Porsche patent this now if sales of new combustion vehicles will be banned starting with 2035 in the EU and I believe some other parts of the world.?\n\nWell, here’s the thing, the EU is not fully banning sales of new combustion vehicles starting with 2035. \nOn the 25th of March of 2023 EU reached an agreement with Germany where it was agreed that sales of and registration of new ICE vehicles will be permitted after 2035, provided that those vehicles operate only on carbon-neutral fuels. \n\nSo what this patent means is that Porsche is taking preventive measures to ensure that it can produce high-power and emissions-friendly engines that can still fit inside the back of a 911 in case e-fuel production ramps up before 2035. By patenting this design Porsche ensures that nobody else can implement it without paying fees to them.\n\nSo will we see this engine in the future? Well, if e-fuel production does actually ramp up, I think it’s likely that Porsche will greenlight some sort of project. Will e-fuel be expensive? Probably. But I doubt that’s a major problem for Porsche buyers. \n\nA special thank you to my patrons:\nDaniel\nPepe\nBrian Alvarez\nPeter Della Flora\nDave Westwood\nJoe C\nZwoa Meda Beda\nToma Marini\nCole Philips\n\n#d4a #porsche #sixstroke\n\n00:00 How it works\n08:34 Benefits\n14: 34 Drawbacks\n19:01 Why now?",

Gears, rod, crank, piston. Even the ports which are known as scavenging ports are ancient. Btw, this very arrangement with ports on one side and valves on the other is known as uniflow scavenging. Because the flow goes in a uniform direction through the cylinder. And this is very common on two stroke diesels in ships and locomotives. The six stroke also don’t make any serious problems for the camshafts. Instead of rotating at half the crankshaft speed, the camshafts will now rotate at one-third the crankshaft speed, so we just need a slightly larger cam gear and we also need an additional lobe on the exhaust come and that’s pretty much it, nothing complex. So there are really no novel mechanics in this which means that it doesn’t need heavy investments into research and development to get it to market. \n\nIt does make more power than a traditional four-stroke. If we observe the first 720 degrees of rotation we can see that we get only one combustion event, just like a traditional four-stroke. But if we observe the next 360 degrees we will see another combustion event starting at 720 degrees of rotation. This does not happen in the traditional four-stroke until we reach 1080 degrees of rotation.\n\nSo if we observe let’s say 7200 degrees of rotation, the traditional four-stroke will perform 10 combustion events. The six stroke will perform  13.34 combustion events. So that’s 33.4% more power than a traditional four-stroke. Now, it’s definitely not in two-stroke territory because a two stroke will perform 20 combustion events in 7200 degrees of rotation and that’s 20 equal, proper combustion events. Remember, on the six stroke, every other combustion event is a mix of exhaust gas and air and fuel which means that we’re probably not looking at a power increase of 33.4% but likely something closer to 25%. But 25% more power with existing technology and emissions cleanliness and durability of a traditional four stroke is still a very significant improvement and a very clever and rational way towards more power. \nSomething else this makes possible is to run very high boost pressure and still be relatively emissions-friendly. To run something like 3 bar boost pressure which is 45 psi you need to run very very rich. You make crazy power but you’re also sending some unburned fuel into the atmosphere which means crappy emissions. But in a six-stroke we would not send all that unburned fuel out. We would send just a bit of it out and the rest would be burned during the next combustion stroke. So potentially, big power and government approval. \n\n\nBut why would Porsche patent this now if sales of new combustion vehicles will be banned starting with 2035 in the EU and I believe some other parts of the world.?\n\nWell, here’s the thing, the EU is not fully banning sales of new combustion vehicles starting with 2035. \nOn the 25th of March of 2023 EU reached an agreement with Germany where it was agreed that sales of and registration of new ICE vehicles will be permitted after 2035, provided that those vehicles operate only on carbon-neutral fuels. \n\nSo what this patent means is that Porsche is taking preventive measures to ensure that it can produce high-power and emissions-friendly engines that can still fit inside the back of a 911 in case e-fuel production ramps up before 2035. By patenting this design Porsche ensures that nobody else can implement it without paying fees to them.\n\nSo will we see this engine in the future? Well, if e-fuel production does actually ramp up, I think it’s likely that Porsche will greenlight some sort of project. Will e-fuel be expensive? Probably. But I doubt that’s a major problem for Porsche buyers. \n\nA special thank you to my patrons:\nDaniel\nPepe\nBrian Alvarez\nPeter Della Flora\nDave Westwood\nJoe C\nZwoa Meda Beda\nToma Marini\nCole Philips\n\n#d4a #porsche #sixstroke\n\n00:00 How it works\n08:34 Benefits\n14: 34 Drawbacks\n19:01 Why now?"

                "description": "We hope you find this tour of Pigeon Forge & Gatlinburg Tennessee helpful!  Thankfully hurricane Helene didn't cause too much Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg flooding.   Neighboring Newport, TN has had much more challenges along with I-40 near the North Carolina & Tennessee border.  Here is the latest update ► https://youtu.be/oVYlgckBvsU\n\nHere is a look at Dollywood Flooded earlier this year ►https://youtu.be/j_IVD6REdUU\n\n🌎 Join Our Next Adventure & SUBSCRIBE Here ► https://bit.ly/3AI411H 🔔\n\n⏰  Tik Tok | https://tiktok.com/@AIOTfamily\n📸  Instagram | http://instagram.com/AIOTfamily\n👤  Facebook | http://facebook.com/AIOTfamily\n🐦 Twitter | https://twitter.com/AIOTfamily\n\n📬  Contact Us\nAdvOutThere@gmail.com\nRyan & Brie\nPO BOX 4975\nSevierville, TN 37864\n\n#gatlinburg #pigeonforge #sevierville #hurricane #smokymountains \n\nAs we take a drive through pigeon forge tennessee we check for any pigeon forge flooding and see how the pigeon forge crowds are.  We then drive into Gatlinburg Tennessee to see how bad the Gatlinburg flooding is and see the Gatlinburg crowd levels after hurricane helene.  Thankfully there was not too smoky mountain flooding and most of the major roads were able to remain open.  We also check out the Dollywood crowds and hopefully give you peace of mind about your upcoming visit!"

While we were immersed in this unique hotel construction, my sister got to know how adorable all of the humane society's dogs are. Wait until you see the grand reveal at the end of this journey, capturing the priceless moment the dogs set paws into their luxury mansion for the first time. For anyone who loves dogs, enjoys creative pet care content, and believes in pampering their furry friends, this video is a must-watch. This was tricky to make, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I love dogs!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I BUILT A $25,000 DREAM DOG HOUSE, But Take a Tour of The Most Luxurious Dog Houses Ever | The Dodo, But I Spent $3,000 Building a Doghouse with a POOL, But I Spent $20,000 Building a Dog House, But I BUILT My DOG Her DREAM House, But Building a HEATED DOG HOUSE for Canadian Winters, But Rescue Abandoned Puppies Build House Craft Jurassic world, But SURPRISING MY FRIENDS WITH MY NEW PUPPY, But I BUILT A $25,000 DREAM DOG HOUSE, But 15 Most Luxurious Dog Houses in The World or any other video like Drew Builds Stuff, The Dodo, House Technology, Alexa Rivera, The Finest, Keeley, Ben Azelart, Brent Rivera, Modustrial Maker, Unspeakable, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.

This video captures the sheer power of the storm as it ravaged this iconic Florida fishing village, leaving behind destruction in its wake. Watch as storm surge waters flood the streets, tearing apart docks, businesses, and boats. See firsthand the impact on local landmarks, with debris strewn everywhere and once-thriving shops and restaurants left in ruins. Witness the heart of John’s Pass under siege from nature’s fury, illustrating the community’s resilience in the face of one of the most powerful hurricanes to strike the area.

ROBLOX DTI CODES\n\nIn this video, I will be showing you all of the newest Dress to Impress Codes for the NEWEST September 2024 Update in DTI!

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, you to ­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\nAll of my videos follow YouTube's TOS.

Check out the Bambu Lab A1 Printer for yourself here: http://shrsl.com/2n2tg-2yn7-1cwx9\n\nIn this episode, we create a custom Minecraft map that spans across 4 different Minecraft biomes for my axolotl, Lime. This 3 dimensional map covers the plains, mountains, snow and lush cave. I even 3D print Minecraft mobs for this setup along with a Minecraft village, Minecraft jungle temple and the Ender Dragon! I can't believe I built Minecraft in real life!\n\nWatch until the end to see the real weather patterns I programmed for our ecosystem, including mist, rain and fog that comes from the Minecraft cave system!

Unaware of what awaits them in each wax-sealed envelope, only one competitor can become the victorious owner of His Royal Task-ness’ golden head and be crowned the next Taskmaster Champion.\n\n#Taskmaster #Comedy #GregDavies #AlexHorne"

Sí,\nEso es para usarlo y\n \nMi cuerpo está diciendo…\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien\nEstoy suelta y ahora\nPuedo hacer lo que quiera \nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nAun huele a verano aquí\n¿Qué tiene de malo?

Sí,\nEso es para usarlo y\n \nMi cuerpo está diciendo…\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien\nEstoy suelta y ahora\nPuedo hacer lo que quiera \nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nAun huele a verano aquí\n¿Qué tiene de malo? Sí\nEso es para usarlo y\n \nMi cuerpo está diciendo…\n\nAun huele a verano aquí\nY eso es para usarlo, si\nHoy algo me gano aquí, \n \nAy, \n\nAhh, se pasa rico soltera \nY ahora las lobas…\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien\nEstoy suelta y ahora\nPuedo hacer lo que quiera \nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nAy que rico…mira que rico\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien \nPa’ que ese cabrón \nCuando me vea le duela\nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien \nPa’ que ese cabrón \nCuando me vea le duela\nSe pasa rico soltera\n\n\nShakira: \nOfficial Site: https://www.shakira.com/\nOfficial Store: https://shakira.store/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/shakira\nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@shakira\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/shakira\nX/ Twitter: https://x.com/shakira\n\n#Shakira #Soltera #CoverAudioVideo\n\nMusic Video by Shakira (Cover Audio Video) performing Soltera.

            "description": "👉 Head to https://brilliant.org/spacetime/ for a 30-day free trial + 20% off your annual subscription\n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nHere’s the story we like to tell about the beginning of the universe. Space is expanding evenly everywhere, but if you rewind that expansion you find that  all of space was once compacted in an infinitesimal point of infinite density—the singularity at the beginning of time. The expansion of the universe from this point is called the Big Bang.  We like to tell this story because it's the correct conclusion from the description of an expanding universe that followed Einstein's general theory of relativity back in the 19-teens. But since then we've learned so much more since then. Does our modern understanding of the universe still insist on a point-like Big Bang? Recent work actually gives us a way to avoid the beginning of time.\n\nSign Up on Patreon to get access to the Space Time Discord!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/pbsspacetime\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\nSearch the Entire Space Time Library Here: https://search.pbsspacetime.com/\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Richard Dyer & Matt O'Dowd \nPost Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini & Stephanie Faria\nDirected by Andrew Kornhaber\nAssociate Producer: Bahar Gholipour\nExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew Kornhaber\nExecutive in Charge for PBS: Maribel Lopez\nDirector of Programming for PBS: Gabrielle Ewing\nAssistant Director of Programming for PBS: John Campbell\n\nSpacetime is a production of Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.\nThis program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.\n© 2024 PBS.

            "description": "🎵 Finally we’re back to who we’re meant to be 🎵\nHere's a sneak peek of the new song “We’re Back” from Disney’s #Moana2. Only in theaters November 27! \n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios’ epic animated musical “Moana 2” reunites Moana (voice of Cravalho) and Maui (voice of Johnson) three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced. Directed by David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller, and produced by Christina Chen and Yvett Merino, “Moana 2” features music by Grammy® winners Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear, Grammy nominee Opetaia Foa‘i, and three-time Grammy winner Mark Mancina. Jared Bush and Miller are writing the film, which is executive produced by Jennifer Lee, Bush and Johnson. \n\nThe film also features returning stars Rachel House (Moana’s Grandma, Tala), Temuera Morrison (Moana’s father, Chief Tui) and Nicole Scherzinger (Moana’s mother, Sina), as well as the voices of Hualālai Chung, David Fane and Rose Matafeo as Moana’s new crew members Moni, Kele and Loto, respectively. Awhimai Fraser voices mysterious new character Matangi; Gerald Ramsey plays Moana’s ancestor, Tautai Vasa; and Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda lends her voice to Moana’s adoring and adorable little sister, Simea.\n \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\n#moana2",
