People are made of cells, cells are made of molecules, molecules are made of atoms, atoms are made of electrons, protons, and neutrons. And protons are each made of three up or down quarks. Simple stuff, right? All except for that last part. Protons are actually made of many, many quarks that happen to look like three only when we look at them in a particular way. And even then, sometimes they’re made of 5 quarks - including the charm quark.\n\nCheck Our Matt on Star Talk with Neil deGrasse Tyson\n https://youtu.be/OcX7xpxOC2U \n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\nSearch the Entire Space Time Library Here: https://search.pbsspacetime.com/\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Fernando Franco Félix & Matt O'Dowd \nPost Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini, Adriano Leal & Stephanie Faria\nDirected by Andrew Kornhaber\nAssociate Producer: Bahar Gholipour\nExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew Kornhaber\nExecutive in Charge for PBS: Maribel Lopez\nDirector of Programming for PBS: Gabrielle Ewing\nAssistant Director of Programming for PBS: John Campbell\n\nSpacetime is produced by Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.\nThis program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.\n© 2023 PBS.

Hitting champions with abilities or killing enemies reduces this ability’s cooldown.\n \n\nQ - Darkin Daggers \nNaafiri hurls Darkin-tainted blades, dealing physical damage and inflicting a bleed for a few seconds.This ability may be recast. If enemies hit are already bleeding, instead deal the remaining bleed damage plus bonus physical damage and missing health physical damage. If the target was a champion, Naafiri restores some health. Packmates will leap at the first target hit, prioritizing champions and attacking them for a few seconds.\n \n\nW - Hounds’ Pursuit  \nAfter a brief delay, Naafiri dashes at an enemy, dealing physical damage and briefly slowing her target or the first champion she collides with. This ability gains range based on ultimate rank. Packmates become untargetable and dash alongside Naafiri, dealing additional damage per Packmate.\n \n\nE - Eviscerate  \nNaafiri surges forward, dashing and dealing physical damage to enemies she passes through, then explodes outward, dealing additional physical damage. Packmates are recalled to Naafiri and are healed to full.\n \n\nR - The Call of the Pack  \nNaafiri prepares to hunt, empowering her Packmates and spawning bonus Packmates for a short duration. Naafiri then gains a burst of out of combat Movespeed, vision, and the first time she hits an enemy champion, she gains a shield. On first champion takedown, all ultimate effects are refreshed.",

Thank you to all the fans and the friends I’ve made along the way, I’m for ever grateful for how positive and real you guys are. I wouldn’t take anything back for the world.

Korvo (Dan Stevens) and Yumyulack (Sean Giambrone) only see the pollution, crass consumerism, and human frailty while Terry (Thomas Middleditch) and Jesse (Mary Mack) love TV, junk food and fun stuff. “Solar Opposites” is executive produced by Mike McMahan and Josh Bycel.

            "description": "Today, the entry point for going mountain biking just got a little bit lower. The Ozark Trail Ridge, a $398 bicycle sold at Walmart stores, actually seems like it would be worth owning—that is if you’re okay with rebuilding it after you take it home.\n\nMy criticism of department store bikes was NEVER that they are cheap, it was always that they are ridiculous. Why does a $150 bicycle have 18 gears and rear suspension? Why not put that money towards better parts and serviceability? I’ll tell you why. The simplest bike with the fewest features looks like a terrible deal to an inexperienced buyer.\n\nBut some of us are, in fact, looking for a simple and affordable bike that’s easy to service and possible to upgrade, and the Ozark Trail Ridge was clearly designed with that in mind. Today, I’m going to show you the Ridge and all the reasons it’s the best department store bike in its price range.\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-29-Ridge-Mountain-Bike-Medium-Frame-Gray/1656914661\n\nUPDATE: BACKCOUNTRY BASH HAS BEEN CANCELLED.

            "description": "First Things First host Nick Wright joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the Bradley Beal-Phoenix Suns trade, including whether the new star will help or hurt his new team. Watch as Nick explains why the Suns new Big 3 will not get closer to the Denver Nuggets nor live up to the NBA Finals hype. He then dives into the level of pressure on Kevin Durant with Beal joining Phoenix, explaining why he may have 'one box unchecked but no pressure on him for the team to win' outside of his legacy. Nick also reacts to Michael Malone taking a jab at LeBron James while on The Pat McAfee Show. Watch as Nick discusses whether Michael Jordan's failure as the Charlotte Hornets owner diminishes his legacy or not.\n\n#TheHerd #NBA #BradleyBeal\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb \n \n►Watch the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/LatestOnTheHerd \n\n▶The Carton Show's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED \n►Speak’s YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from THE HERD: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFoxSports \nLike THE HERD on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFacebook \nFollow THE HERD on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDTwitter \nFollow THE HERD on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDInstagram \n\nFollow Colin Cowherd on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ColinCowherdTwitter \n \nAbout The Herd with Colin Cowherd:\nThe Herd with Colin Cowherd is a three-hour sports television and radio show on FS1 and iHeartRadio.

                "description": "First Things First host Nick Wright joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the Bradley Beal-Phoenix Suns trade, including whether the new star will help or hurt his new team. Watch as Nick explains why the Suns new Big 3 will not get closer to the Denver Nuggets nor live up to the NBA Finals hype. He then dives into the level of pressure on Kevin Durant with Beal joining Phoenix, explaining why he may have 'one box unchecked but no pressure on him for the team to win' outside of his legacy. Nick also reacts to Michael Malone taking a jab at LeBron James while on The Pat McAfee Show. Watch as Nick discusses whether Michael Jordan's failure as the Charlotte Hornets owner diminishes his legacy or not.\n\n#TheHerd #NBA #BradleyBeal\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb \n \n►Watch the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/LatestOnTheHerd \n\n▶The Carton Show's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED \n►Speak’s YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from THE HERD: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFoxSports \nLike THE HERD on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFacebook \nFollow THE HERD on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDTwitter \nFollow THE HERD on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDInstagram \n\nFollow Colin Cowherd on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ColinCowherdTwitter \n \nAbout The Herd with Colin Cowherd:\nThe Herd with Colin Cowherd is a three-hour sports television and radio show on FS1 and iHeartRadio.

            "description": "Croatia and Spain faced off in Rotterdam, Netherlands, for the UEFA Nations League Final. Possession was near-equal in the first half with Spain knocking off six shots total and Croatia with seven. Three of Croatia’s seven shots were on goal, however none were successful. Halftime arrived nil-nil. Croatia took control early in the second half with an extremely close opportunity at 51’. Spain would strike back-to-back at 84’ and 85’ in attempt to take the lead in regular time. Tension grew as both 15 minute halves of extra time passed, still nil-nil. After a nail-biter round of penalty kicks, Dani Carvajal scored the 5-4 finisher and Spain was crowned victorious in the UEFA Nations League Final.\n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #Spain\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.
