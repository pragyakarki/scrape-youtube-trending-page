            "description": "Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix brings back the CH2 Island, but reimagined with weekly POI and weapon drops inspired by some of the greatest music icons of all time.\n\nEach week one classic location of the Chapter 2 Remix map will be taken over by one of the four artists. In addition to the location change, each artist will also have a weapon themed to them. See the weekly breakdown:\n\nWeek 1 (starting November 2nd)\nThe Agency compound is now The Doggpound. The Doggfather will gift you Snoop’s Drum Gun Mythic if you can defeat him, and will join you as an ally!\n\nWeek 2 (starting November 7th)\nThe Grotto lair turns into Spaghetti Grotto. And if you can defeat Eminem, he’ll join your cause and bestow you with his RG Minigun. \n\nWeek 3 (starting November 14th)\nThe Shark is now dubbed Ice Isle with Ice Spice claiming dibs! Defeat Ice to add her to your team and get Ice Spice’s Grappler and Ice Spice’s Rifle Mythics!\n\nWeek 4 (starting November 21st)\nKeep an eye to the skies at the WRLD Point landmark arriving in Week 4.\n\nIn addition to the Remix aspect of weekly artist takeovers, you’ll notice that familiarity is also in the air. Favorite vehicles like Choppas and Motorboats return later in the season. Classic Chapter 2 weapons are also making an appearance as they unvault throughout the season. There’s also new vehicle features like the 1966 Cadillac DeVille which has hydraulics, bounces to music, and can jump in the air!\n\nFinally, with Chapter 2 Remix you’re getting an all-new Chapter 2 inspired Pass. This pass includes Outfits like: Chaos Director, 1-Ball, Undercover Skye, Meowdas, and Dynamo TNTina. Not to mention Kicks– a new cosmetic type that will be featured for the first time in the Remix Pass with a pair of Jordan’s. \n\nThrowback and look forward in Chapter 2 Remix.\n\n#FortniteChapter2Remix #Chapter2Remix #FortniteCh2Remix\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode. One giant map, A Battle Bus, Last one standing wins.

                "description": "Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix brings back the CH2 Island, but reimagined with weekly POI and weapon drops inspired by some of the greatest music icons of all time.\n\nEach week one classic location of the Chapter 2 Remix map will be taken over by one of the four artists. In addition to the location change, each artist will also have a weapon themed to them. See the weekly breakdown:\n\nWeek 1 (starting November 2nd)\nThe Agency compound is now The Doggpound. The Doggfather will gift you Snoop’s Drum Gun Mythic if you can defeat him, and will join you as an ally!\n\nWeek 2 (starting November 7th)\nThe Grotto lair turns into Spaghetti Grotto. And if you can defeat Eminem, he’ll join your cause and bestow you with his RG Minigun. \n\nWeek 3 (starting November 14th)\nThe Shark is now dubbed Ice Isle with Ice Spice claiming dibs! Defeat Ice to add her to your team and get Ice Spice’s Grappler and Ice Spice’s Rifle Mythics!\n\nWeek 4 (starting November 21st)\nKeep an eye to the skies at the WRLD Point landmark arriving in Week 4.\n\nIn addition to the Remix aspect of weekly artist takeovers, you’ll notice that familiarity is also in the air. Favorite vehicles like Choppas and Motorboats return later in the season. Classic Chapter 2 weapons are also making an appearance as they unvault throughout the season. There’s also new vehicle features like the 1966 Cadillac DeVille which has hydraulics, bounces to music, and can jump in the air!\n\nFinally, with Chapter 2 Remix you’re getting an all-new Chapter 2 inspired Pass. This pass includes Outfits like: Chaos Director, 1-Ball, Undercover Skye, Meowdas, and Dynamo TNTina. Not to mention Kicks– a new cosmetic type that will be featured for the first time in the Remix Pass with a pair of Jordan’s. \n\nThrowback and look forward in Chapter 2 Remix.\n\n#FortniteChapter2Remix #Chapter2Remix #FortniteCh2Remix\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode. One giant map, A Battle Bus, Last one standing wins.

            "description": "I dug up a mystery reptilian egg that I found in my yard, from my giant rainforest vivarium, Pantdora. I had thought it was dead, but it seems the ecosystem and conditions within the vivarium were perfect for the egg's incubation, as it failed to rot and decompose even after over a month later. I felt, for my safety and that of the animals within the vivarium, it was time to take matters into my own hands and dig up the mystery egg to candle it and check for a living fetus. Doing so was quite the adventure. Hope you enjoy this Episode 10, Season 3 of my Eocsystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever!

Collaborate with your friends to build and upgrade the Thermal Tower. Team up now to explore the new map, face mighty bosses, secure new deviations, and discover even more exciting content!\n\nThe apocalypse changed everything. Human, animal, plant… all are infested by an alien creature – Stardust. As a Meta-Human, you can survive the contamination and use the power of Stardust. Play alone or join others to fight, build and explore. When the world is in chaos, you are our last hope.\n\nSurvive in the wilderness\nYou wake up in the middle of nowhere. You'll have to brace yourself for the cruelty of nature (from monsters to lack of food); however, Stardust's influence does not restrict to living things, it also affects the soil and water. Eating polluted food and drinking dirty water will reduce your Sanity. When your Sanity drops, your max HP would drop accordingly. To eat or not to eat, it's a question.\n\nFight against monsters\nBattle numerous enemies that are once human, and challenge bosses from another dimension to gain powerful items and ease Stardust pollution. You are not only fighting for yourself, but also fighting for the survivors.\n\nCustomize weapons\nWith about 100 gun blueprints divided into seven categories for you to collect and craft, every loot grants you something new. Did I mention accessories and gun perks? Right, they are the heroes here. If our current weapon cannot satisfy your need, you can add different parts and perks, upgrade your firearm to your heart's content.\n\nBuild territory\nUse Territory Core to build a house of your own. You can keep a practical style, jamming everything needed in a small room; or you can design a townhouse with a patio, kitchen, garage… The best part is, you can relocate your territory any time you want!\n\nFind out the truth\nDelve into the truth of Stardust, find out where it came from, and what it wants. In the journey of seeking truth, you may feel alone, but you are never alone. There are several factions in the world, some can be violent and hostile, others might be friendly and helpful. Explore human settlements to learn their stories or exterminate bosses without leaving a name for survivors to praise, the choices are yours.",
