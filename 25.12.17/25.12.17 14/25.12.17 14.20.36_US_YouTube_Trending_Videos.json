This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. \nWe are coming close to … Disclosure Day. \n\nUniversal Pictures is proud to release a new original event film created and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars SAG winner and Oscar® nominee Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place), Emmy and Golden Globe winner Josh O’Connor (Challengers, The Crown), Oscar® winner Colin Firth (The King’s Speech, Kingsman franchise), Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, The Perfect Couple) and two-time Oscar® nominee Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin).\n \nBased on a story by Spielberg, the screenplay is by David Koepp, whose previous work with Spielberg includes the scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Combined, those films earned more than $3 billion worldwide. Koepp also wrote the script for this 2025’s Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nDisclosure Day is produced by five-time Academy Award® nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (The Fabelmans, West Side Story) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. \n\nSteven Spielberg is one of the industry’s most successful and influential filmmakers. The top-grossing director of all time, Spielberg has helmed such blockbusters as Jaws, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones franchise and Jurassic Park. \n \nAmong his myriad honors, he is a three-time Academy Award® winner, including Oscars® for Best Director and Best Picture for Schindler’s List, which received a total of seven Oscars®, and for Best Director for Saving Private Ryan. His most recent film, The Fabelmans, was released by Universal in 2022 and received seven Academy Award® nominations, including for Directing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture. \n\nWebsite: http://disclosuredaymovie.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/disclosuredayfilm/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disclosureday/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics?lang=en\nX: https://x.com/disclosureday\nHashtag: #DisclosureDay",

                "description": "— Attention Viewers ⚠️\n— This is a Fan-Made Concept Trailer for:\n— Avengers: Doomsday\n\n— Music Credits - https://youtu.be/6Ot-gRruxng\n\n— This video is a fan-made concept trailer, created solely for artistic and entertainment purposes.The goal behind this trailer is to showcase my creativity and storytelling skills through a concept trailer based on a unique and original idea. By combining various effects, sound design, and AI technologies, I’ve crafted a cinematic experience that reimagines familiar worlds in bold and imaginative ways. This trailer is not official and is intended to entertain, inspire, and engage with the YouTube community. Thank you for your support — now let’s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. 🎬✨\n\n— In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story centers on the long-unresolved consequences of Steve Rogers’ final choice in Endgame, revealing that his decision to remain in the past fractured reality in ways the Avengers never anticipated. As timelines splinter and the stability of the main MCU begins to erode, Steve is forced back into the conflict, confronting the personal cost of his legacy and the ripple effects of his sacrifice. The narrative hints at a corrupted alternate reality where familiar heroes took darker paths, drawing Doctor Doom into the heart of the multiversal crisis and threatening total collapse across worlds. With time itself no longer trustworthy, Rogers emerges as both the cause and the possible solution, facing a reckoning that could determine whether the prime timeline survives or is rewritten forever.\n\n—  Subscribe to Teaser Universe 🎬\n—  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#robertdowneyjr #marvel #doomsday \n\navengers doomsday,doomsday trailer,avengers doomsday trailer chris evans,avengers doomsday robert downey jr,avengers doomsday leaks,avengers doomsday trailer,avengers doomsday 2026 trailer,tobey maguire doomsday trailer,doomsday trailer leak,avengers doomsday official trailer,avengers doomsday trailer official,robert downey jr dr doom trailer,avengers doomsday tobey maguire,trailers,avengers doomsday new trailer,avengers doomsday cast,avengers doomsday cast reveal"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

The entertainment industry’s most competitive reality stars and famous faces play the ultimate murder mystery game. Hosted by award-winning actor Alan Cumming at an ancient castle set deep in the Scottish Highlands, contestants work together on a series of exhilarating missions to build a prize fund worth up to $250,000. Hidden amongst the Faithful are the Traitors, whose goal is to eliminate the Faithful and claim the prize for themselves. Under the cover of darkness, the Traitors murder the Faithful one by one in a treacherous spree, while the Faithful try to uncover the Traitors and banish them from the game. If the Faithful contestants banish all the Traitors, they will share the prize fund, but if a Traitor (or Traitors) makes it to the end, they will steal all the money.\n\n#Peacock #TheTraitorsUS #OfficialTrailer\n\nPeacock is your go-to for hit movies, TV, live sports, and more.

                "description": "De trailer van Disclosure Day is net uitgekomen – en de impact ervan gaat veel verder dan die van een gewone filmtrailer. De beelden, symboliek en boodschap voelen weloverwogen, getimed en diep verbonden met het bredere verhaal over de onthulling van UFO's dat zich momenteel in de cultuur ontvouwt. Deze analyse richt zich op wat de trailer aangeeft, waarom het belangrijk is en hoe het de publieke verwachtingen lijkt te beïnvloeden in plaats van simpelweg een verhaal te vertellen.\n\nIn deze video onderzoeken we hoe specifieke scènes in de trailer de onthulling afbeelden als onvermijdelijk, emotioneel en gezaghebbend – waarbij thema's als angst, ontzag, religie en controle worden gebruikt om de perceptie te sturen. Het gaat hier niet om persoonlijke reacties, maar om het begrijpen van de psychologische en spirituele betekenis van wat er wordt gepresenteerd.\n\nBekijk de trailer van Disclosure Day hier zelf, vóór of na deze analyse:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVh0KnnGW_s\n\nDit wordt gepresenteerd vanuit een Bijbels perspectief, waarbij Hollywood-verhalen, moderne taal over onthulling en waarschuwingen voor misleiding in de eindtijd met elkaar worden verbonden, zonder sensatiezucht of hype.\n\nVergeet niet je GRATIS geschenk van mij te ontvangen op https://www.larryragland.com/free/\n\nen laat ook je gebedsverzoek achter.\n\nOm met ons in contact te komen, partner te worden of ons te contacteren, ga naar:\nhttps://www.larryragland.com/\n\nRegistreer je nu voor de Big Picture Prophecy Conference:\nhttps://www.tickettailor.com/events/solidrockchurch/1968105\n\nInteresse om met ons mee te reizen naar Israël?\n\nStuur een e-mail naar info@larryragland.com\n\nmet je naam en het aantal reizigers.\n\nAls deze bediening jou en je familie tot zegen is, kun je veilig online doneren via:\nhttps://www.solidrockchurch.com/give\n\nHashtags:\n#DisclosureDay #UFODisclosure #HollywoodNarratives #UAP #PredictiveProgramming #BibleProphecy #EndTimesDeception #TheBigPicture #Discernment"

                "description": "ディスクロージャー・デーの予告編が公開されました。そのインパクトは、通常の映画予告編をはるかに超えています。そのイメージ、象徴性、そしてメッセージは、意図的で、タイミングが合っており、今まさに文化の中で展開されているUFOディスクロージャーというより広範な物語と深く結びついています。この分析では、この予告編が何を示唆しているのか、なぜ重要なのか、そして単に物語を語るのではなく、どのように人々の期待を形作っているのかに焦点を当てます。\n\nこの動画では、予告編の特定のシーンが、恐怖、畏怖、宗教、そして支配というテーマを用いて、ディスクロージャーを不可避的、感情的、そして権威的なものとしてどのように描いているかを検証します。これは個人的な反応ではなく、提示されているものの心理的、精神的な重みを理解することです。\n\nこの分析の前後に、こちらでディスクロージャー・デーの予告編をご自身でご覧ください。\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVh0KnnGW_s\n\nこれは、ハリウッドのストーリーテリング、現代のディスクロージャー言語、そして終末期の欺瞞に関する警告を、センセーショナリズムや誇大宣伝なしに、聖書的な洞察のレンズを通して提示しています。\n\nhttps://www.larryragland.com/free/ で無料ギフトをお受け取りください。\nまた、祈りのリクエストもお寄せください。\n\n私たちと繋がったり、パートナーになったり、ご連絡をいただくには、以下のサイトをご覧ください。\nhttps://www.larryragland.com/\n\nビッグ・ピクチャー預言カンファレンスへのご登録はこちら：\nhttps://www.tickettailor.com/events/solidrockchurch/1968105\n\nイスラエルへの旅にご興味がありますか？\ninfo@larryragland.com まで、お名前と人数を明記の上、メールでお問い合わせください。\n\nこのミニストリーがあなたとご家族に祝福をもたらしているなら、以下のサイトで安全にオンラインで寄付できます。\nhttps://www.solidrockchurch.com/give\n\nハッシュタグ：\n#DisclosureDay #UFODisclosure #HollywoodNarratives #UAP #PredictiveProgramming #BibleProphecy #EndTimesDeception #TheBigPicture #Discernment"

I break down industry trends, publisher decisions, and the economics behind how games are made, marketed, and sold.\n\nWhether it’s GTA 6, Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Path of Exile 2, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Pokémon, or the next doomed live-service experiment, I cover how the industry’s biggest names keep shaping and breaking the games we play. \n\nFrom deep dive analysis on publishers like EA, Bungie, Blizzard, Activision, Ubisoft, Sony, and Microsoft to commentary on indie hits like Palworld and Expedition 33, every video cuts through the marketing to get to what actually matters: how this industry works, who it’s failing, and why players deserve better.\n\nTime Stamps\n0:00 - Intro\n03:42 - Highguard"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",
