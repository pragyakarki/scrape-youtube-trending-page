We’re dying for you to view our teaser trailer and poster for Disney’s comically creepy adventure “Haunted Mansion,” which will appear in theaters on July 28. \n \nDirected by award-winning filmmaker Justin Simien, the film features an all-star ensemble cast including LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rosario Dawson, Chase W. Dillon and Dan Levy, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto as The Hatbox Ghost.\n \nDirector Simien says, “As a lifelong fan of the Haunted Mansion attraction, I’m beyond excited to share the teaser trailer for our new film adaptation featuring an incredible cast. Our team has worked tirelessly to create a scary, funny and cinematic otherworldly adventure for both new and die-hard fans to enjoy! I can’t wait for audiences to experience this big screen version of the iconic Disney attraction.”\n \nInspired by the classic theme park attraction, “Haunted Mansion” is about a woman and her son who enlist a motley crew of so-called spiritual experts to help rid their home of supernatural squatters. The film’s producers are Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich, with Nick Reynolds and Tom Peitzman serving as executive producers.\n \nSOCIAL MEDIA:\n#HauntedMansion\nIG: @HauntedMansion\nTW: @HauntedMansion\nFB: @HauntedMansion",

            "title": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 1 BREAKDOWN - STAR WARS IS BACK",
            "description": "as we begin the first episode of the mandalorian season 3, we get the armorer crafting a new mandalorian helmet, ceremoniously welcoming a young mandalorian boy into their creed of mandalorian’s which are the children of the watch. The same as Djin Darin. We also see Paz Vizsla there amongst them, who helped Mando in the first season. He’s pretty cool with his gattling gun. He also is a direct descendant of Tarre Vizsla I assume as they have the same last name. Tarre Vizsla was the first jedi mandalorian, whom i believe Grogu will follow suit eventually. Now, this creed is different from other mandalorian sects, in which a mando cannot remove one’s helmet in the presence of any sentient being. As they say their creed and swear on the names of their ancestors that they shall walk the way of the mandalore, a massive sea monster emerges from the ocean, giving major jurassic park meets star wars vibes. \n\nSeeking retribution for his good will, we walks into the cave of the armorer where she says you removed your helmet, you are no longer a mandalorian. if we remember from the book of boba fett, he told her this and she said he’s no longer a mandalorian for this. The reason behind this is because they’re very traditional, they’re not like new mandalorians like bo katan who follow a more relaxed ideology and much less superstitious, but also to protect them by hiding their numbers. For it’s hard to track numbers by helmet as they can all look similar, but it’s easy to count by faces.\n\nShe says redemption is no longer possible since the destruction of mandalore.\n\nHe shows her a piece of crystal from Mandalore that Jawas bought from a random traveler. She is stunned to see it as it’s impossible for anyone to take anything from Mandalore, as setting foot on the planet would kill them as it is poisoned. Clearly, it hasn’t been, since he now has this proof.\nShe says this proves that mandalore’s surface has been crystalized by fusion rays, from all the bombing from the night of a thousand tears.\n\nThey leave to Navarro 7 in hyperspace, as Grogu looks out the window to notice massive space whales travelling with them in hyperspace. These are the Purgil we was from star wars rebels who helped Ezra and took him to an unknown place, along with Thrawn. I like how they showed this, it was a nice scene, and connects Ezra, Ahsoka, and Thrawn to the timeline. Maybe we’ll see them in this season of the mandalorian, maybe we will in Ahsoka’s show only. I guess we’ll see.\n\nThey head to Navarro 7 where we meet up with Greef Carga again, as he lands down and the town looks really clean and rennovated. Lots of life, merchants, aliens from all over. It’s buzzing with droids and beings. It looks great and very star wars, unlike Kenobi which barely had any aliens in it.\n\nWe come up to the IG-11 droid statue, where his parts have been salvaged as much as possible, and he stands as a becaon of hope to all for his efforts.\n\nGrogu uses the force to spin his chair, which is the same thing Yoda did in revenge of the sith at the end of the film on polis massa, albeit he wasn’t doing it for fun, he just had to turn to talk to Obi-Wan and Bail Organa as his feet are too short to touch the ground.\n\nThey walk off and Mando gets offered the job of Ranger where he asks about Cara Dune, where it’s revealed she was promoted to special forces when she brought Moff Gideon in. It’s a better send off for Cara than saying she’s dead or something, but I still wish she was in the show and that Gina didn’t get fired. Moff Gideon was sent to a New Republic War Tribunal.\n\nHeading to his final destination of the episode, Mando and Grogu arrive to kalevala, another planet in the mandalorian system and home to house Kryze as they come to a Mandalorian Castle…where Bo Katan is kicking her feet up on her empty throne, alone. They gave her a new wig this season and it looks very much like her animated form.\n\nShe’s melancholy because when she arrived back to her people without the dark saber, she lost all respect and her authority to lead them. She’s mad about it, and blames the children of the watch and all factions before it for dividing their people, instead of uniting them. She is of the new mandalorians who don’t care for such trivial uptight traditions like forbidding ones from removing helmets.\n\nShe says goodbye din djarrin in a nefarious tone…either she gave him some wack gps location where he’s gonna get killed, or she really thinks the planet is poisoned and he won’t make it out alive. Either way, she’ll probably go there to scoop up the dark saber from his lifeless body. The way she said goodbye with that jealous and angry tone, really makes her a questionable character now…is she an ally, neutral, or foe…i guess we’ll find out next episode.\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join",

                "description": "as we begin the first episode of the mandalorian season 3, we get the armorer crafting a new mandalorian helmet, ceremoniously welcoming a young mandalorian boy into their creed of mandalorian’s which are the children of the watch. The same as Djin Darin. We also see Paz Vizsla there amongst them, who helped Mando in the first season. He’s pretty cool with his gattling gun. He also is a direct descendant of Tarre Vizsla I assume as they have the same last name. Tarre Vizsla was the first jedi mandalorian, whom i believe Grogu will follow suit eventually. Now, this creed is different from other mandalorian sects, in which a mando cannot remove one’s helmet in the presence of any sentient being. As they say their creed and swear on the names of their ancestors that they shall walk the way of the mandalore, a massive sea monster emerges from the ocean, giving major jurassic park meets star wars vibes. \n\nSeeking retribution for his good will, we walks into the cave of the armorer where she says you removed your helmet, you are no longer a mandalorian. if we remember from the book of boba fett, he told her this and she said he’s no longer a mandalorian for this. The reason behind this is because they’re very traditional, they’re not like new mandalorians like bo katan who follow a more relaxed ideology and much less superstitious, but also to protect them by hiding their numbers. For it’s hard to track numbers by helmet as they can all look similar, but it’s easy to count by faces.\n\nShe says redemption is no longer possible since the destruction of mandalore.\n\nHe shows her a piece of crystal from Mandalore that Jawas bought from a random traveler. She is stunned to see it as it’s impossible for anyone to take anything from Mandalore, as setting foot on the planet would kill them as it is poisoned. Clearly, it hasn’t been, since he now has this proof.\nShe says this proves that mandalore’s surface has been crystalized by fusion rays, from all the bombing from the night of a thousand tears.\n\nThey leave to Navarro 7 in hyperspace, as Grogu looks out the window to notice massive space whales travelling with them in hyperspace. These are the Purgil we was from star wars rebels who helped Ezra and took him to an unknown place, along with Thrawn. I like how they showed this, it was a nice scene, and connects Ezra, Ahsoka, and Thrawn to the timeline. Maybe we’ll see them in this season of the mandalorian, maybe we will in Ahsoka’s show only. I guess we’ll see.\n\nThey head to Navarro 7 where we meet up with Greef Carga again, as he lands down and the town looks really clean and rennovated. Lots of life, merchants, aliens from all over. It’s buzzing with droids and beings. It looks great and very star wars, unlike Kenobi which barely had any aliens in it.\n\nWe come up to the IG-11 droid statue, where his parts have been salvaged as much as possible, and he stands as a becaon of hope to all for his efforts.\n\nGrogu uses the force to spin his chair, which is the same thing Yoda did in revenge of the sith at the end of the film on polis massa, albeit he wasn’t doing it for fun, he just had to turn to talk to Obi-Wan and Bail Organa as his feet are too short to touch the ground.\n\nThey walk off and Mando gets offered the job of Ranger where he asks about Cara Dune, where it’s revealed she was promoted to special forces when she brought Moff Gideon in. It’s a better send off for Cara than saying she’s dead or something, but I still wish she was in the show and that Gina didn’t get fired. Moff Gideon was sent to a New Republic War Tribunal.\n\nHeading to his final destination of the episode, Mando and Grogu arrive to kalevala, another planet in the mandalorian system and home to house Kryze as they come to a Mandalorian Castle…where Bo Katan is kicking her feet up on her empty throne, alone. They gave her a new wig this season and it looks very much like her animated form.\n\nShe’s melancholy because when she arrived back to her people without the dark saber, she lost all respect and her authority to lead them. She’s mad about it, and blames the children of the watch and all factions before it for dividing their people, instead of uniting them. She is of the new mandalorians who don’t care for such trivial uptight traditions like forbidding ones from removing helmets.\n\nShe says goodbye din djarrin in a nefarious tone…either she gave him some wack gps location where he’s gonna get killed, or she really thinks the planet is poisoned and he won’t make it out alive. Either way, she’ll probably go there to scoop up the dark saber from his lifeless body. The way she said goodbye with that jealous and angry tone, really makes her a questionable character now…is she an ally, neutral, or foe…i guess we’ll find out next episode.\n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join"

This will cause all sorts of problems in Russian-held territory: it will flood the area downstream, it will limit the irrigation of agricultural fields to the south, and it might limit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's ability to cool itself. Why is Russia doing this?

To take his subathon (aka MAFIAthon) to the next level, I decided to surprise him with his dream steaming setup! This was absolutely insane to make becuase we only had one day to make it happen. To distract Kai for the day, we sent him to Universal Studios with an all access pass and he had a blast. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! Kai loved his new Spiderman gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! Comment what your dream gaming room would look like so I can notice you!\n\nNot Kai Cenat's MAFIATHON, But Step Into Ninja's Ultimate Stream Room, But Kai Cenat Goes Sneaker Shopping With Complex, But 20 WOMEN VS 1 SIDEMEN: KAI CENAT EDITION, But Kai Cenat & 21 Savage FULL STREAM, But I Built a Secret Room in Public, But Kai Cenat Facetimes KSI After Jake Paul Loss, But Kai Cenat's WILDEST Try Not To Laugh, But The Truth Behind The Sidemen Video, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But Kai Cenat Tries a BIRTH SIMULATOR, But I Built a SECRET Hidden Gaming Room in my House, But I Built iShowSpeed His Dream Gaming Roomor any other video like Kai Cenat Live, Kay, Complex, Red Bull Gaming, FaZe Rug, Jake Carlini, LetsGo, AllWeDoIsFun, Sidemen, Unspeakable, Ryan Trahan, Preston, MrBeast, or Airrack would make.

To take his subathon (aka MAFIAthon) to the next level, I decided to surprise him with his dream steaming setup! This was absolutely insane to make becuase we only had one day to make it happen. To distract Kai for the day, we sent him to Universal Studios with an all access pass and he had a blast. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! Kai loved his new Spiderman gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! Comment what your dream gaming room would look like so I can notice you!\n\nNot Kai Cenat's MAFIATHON, But Step Into Ninja's Ultimate Stream Room, But Kai Cenat Goes Sneaker Shopping With Complex, But 20 WOMEN VS 1 SIDEMEN: KAI CENAT EDITION, But Kai Cenat & 21 Savage FULL STREAM, But I Built a Secret Room in Public, But Kai Cenat Facetimes KSI After Jake Paul Loss, But Kai Cenat's WILDEST Try Not To Laugh, But The Truth Behind The Sidemen Video, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But Kai Cenat Tries a BIRTH SIMULATOR, But I Built a SECRET Hidden Gaming Room in my House, But I Built iShowSpeed His Dream Gaming Roomor any other video like Kai Cenat Live, Kay, Complex, Red Bull Gaming, FaZe Rug, Jake Carlini, LetsGo, AllWeDoIsFun, Sidemen, Unspeakable, Ryan Trahan, Preston, MrBeast, or Airrack would make.

Today we will be doing just that by showing one of the fastest and easiest ways to beat the game using just a stick! That's right, this entire 20+ hour game can be beaten with just a stick as sticks allow you to faze through reality. This is rather similar to an exploit in the forest that allowed you to speedrun through all of the locked keycard doors in the game! \n\nToday I will be crossing the entire survival island bypassing the keycard door into the underground lab. Skipping the 3d printing section and going straight for the endgame by sticking my way through the super special final secret door! Sure you might watch a beginer tips and tricks video telling you what to do and how to play the game. Or you could watch The Spiffing Brit explain how to break the laws of reality and bypass all of that fun sons of the forest gameplay with a good old fashion stick take that ign! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage.

Busch was a strong contender to win the first stage until he suffered a pit-stop penalty which played a role into Busch finishing 12th. Chastain cruised to a comfortable first-place finish. Chastain continued this theme in the second stage where he again finished in first place, followed by Kyle Busch and Joey Logano. However, in the final stage, Busch took it to another level and was able to win the Pala Casino 400. With the victory, Busch holds the all-time record for consecutive cup seasons with a victory at 19 and is now ninth in the all-time victories list.\n\n#NASCARonFOX #NASCAR #Fontana\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOX\nLike NASCAR on FOX on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXFacebook\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXTwitter\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXInstagram\n\nAbout NASCAR on FOX:\nYour home for NASCAR on FOX, from Raceday to Radioactive and all of the racing action in between.\n\n2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX\nhttps://youtu.be/ZXJyURa1Cww\n\nNASCAR on FOX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/NASCARonFOX",

            "description": "Hey guys! Today I attempt to \"Fix The Unfixable\" squishies in my collection. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my \"hopeless bin\" and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!\n\nDON'T FORGET TO GET THE ME PLAYING CARDS:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/p/7422520721599\n\n*available only until March 20th*\n\n________FAQs_________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.
