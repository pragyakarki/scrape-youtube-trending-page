Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family.

As neighboring countries that share a long and porous border, Pakistan and Afghanistan have a deeply intertwined history that has been marked by conflict, cooperation, and occasional periods of stability.\n\nIn this video, we delve into the key issues that have shaped the relationship between these two countries, from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s to the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s and the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. We also explore the role of regional and international actors in shaping the dynamic between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including India, Iran, China, and the United States.\n\nOur video features interviews with experts and analysts who provide insights into the complex geopolitical and security challenges facing both countries. We also examine the economic and cultural ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the ongoing efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.\n\nWhether you're a student of international relations, a history buff, or simply curious about the complex relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, our video is a must-watch.

                "description": "Get our Red Following Love T shirt here: https://bit.ly/3C7SGeL\n\nIn this video, Abhi and Niyu discuss how Pakistan's focus on militarization of bordering areas contributed towards the current Pakistani Economic Crisis. \n\nWelcome to our latest video exploring the complex and often turbulent relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan. As neighboring countries that share a long and porous border, Pakistan and Afghanistan have a deeply intertwined history that has been marked by conflict, cooperation, and occasional periods of stability.\n\nIn this video, we delve into the key issues that have shaped the relationship between these two countries, from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s to the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s and the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. We also explore the role of regional and international actors in shaping the dynamic between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including India, Iran, China, and the United States.\n\nOur video features interviews with experts and analysts who provide insights into the complex geopolitical and security challenges facing both countries. We also examine the economic and cultural ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the ongoing efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.\n\nWhether you're a student of international relations, a history buff, or simply curious about the complex relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, our video is a must-watch. So sit back, grab some popcorn, and join us for a deep dive into the history, politics, and culture of these two fascinating countries.\n\n#pakistaneconomy #geopolitics #abhiandniyu \n\nA video by Abhiraj Rajadhyaksha & Niyati Mavinkurve\n\nGet our equipment:\n\nMy favourite camera: https://amzn.to/3hYR3ZT\nBudget camera to shoot videos: https://amzn.to/3vmcHtZ\nBest Tripod to shoot videos: https://amzn.to/3VtVY2D\nBest Mic for YouTube: https://amzn.to/3C9OOtH\nBest light for background lighting: https://amzn.to/3WM1CyN\nPhone to shoot Reels: https://amzn.to/3GrhAZp\nBest laptop to edit on: https://amzn.to/3juJIS5\nCheapest laptop to edit 4K videos: https://amzn.to/3vkSOUm\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/abhiandniyu\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/abhiandniyu\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abhiandniyu\n\nAbout Us:\nAbhi and Niyu is the fastest growing Indian educational YouTube channel.

            "description": "क्या Bihaan को भूल पाएगी Thapki? | Thapki Pyar Ki | थपकी प्यार की | Full Episode | Ep. 638\n\nFifteen years have passed since Bihaan's death and Bani's disappearance, but Thapki still refuses to come to terms with her sorrowful past and move on. Will Thapki ever get over Bihaan or will a miracle happen?\n\nThe bright and beautiful Thapki is pretty much perfect... except for one minor flaw - she stammers. But that doesn't hold her back. All she needs is an encouraging pat on the back,a 'thapki', which soon becomes her name. Over the course of the show, Thapki falls in love with Dhruv, but is duped into getting married to his brother, Bihaan. In spite of this cruel twist of fate, Thapki doesn't let her spirit fade and does all she can to be the ideal bahu. What does destiny hold for this charming girl with an unbeatable spirit?\n\nWatch more videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX18mvVSh-bzmIBfH3sKcKbGZQJ_OGGIg\n\nTo download the Voot app please click on the link: https://voot.onelink.me/eIb4/9b2f5423\n\nTo subscribe to this channel, go to: https://www.youtube.com/c/ColorsRishtey1/featured\n\nFollow us on: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/colorsrishteyindia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rishteytv/\n\n#ColorsRishtey #ThapkiPyarKi #थपकीप्यारकी\n\nThe accuracy, completeness, currency and/or suitability of the above video description is not endorsed by its licensor or broadcaster or the Channel.

                "description": "क्या Bihaan को भूल पाएगी Thapki? | Thapki Pyar Ki | थपकी प्यार की | Full Episode | Ep. 638\n\nFifteen years have passed since Bihaan's death and Bani's disappearance, but Thapki still refuses to come to terms with her sorrowful past and move on. Will Thapki ever get over Bihaan or will a miracle happen?\n\nThe bright and beautiful Thapki is pretty much perfect... except for one minor flaw - she stammers. But that doesn't hold her back. All she needs is an encouraging pat on the back,a 'thapki', which soon becomes her name. Over the course of the show, Thapki falls in love with Dhruv, but is duped into getting married to his brother, Bihaan. In spite of this cruel twist of fate, Thapki doesn't let her spirit fade and does all she can to be the ideal bahu. What does destiny hold for this charming girl with an unbeatable spirit?\n\nWatch more videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX18mvVSh-bzmIBfH3sKcKbGZQJ_OGGIg\n\nTo download the Voot app please click on the link: https://voot.onelink.me/eIb4/9b2f5423\n\nTo subscribe to this channel, go to: https://www.youtube.com/c/ColorsRishtey1/featured\n\nFollow us on: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/colorsrishteyindia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rishteytv/\n\n#ColorsRishtey #ThapkiPyarKi #थपकीप्यारकी\n\nThe accuracy, completeness, currency and/or suitability of the above video description is not endorsed by its licensor or broadcaster or the Channel.

Then add some Ghee & knead well & bind the soft dough. Divide the dough into four parts & roll them. Roast the rolled Chapati on a pan, prick it with a fork & apply some Ghee while roasting. Keep them in small pieces & keep them for cooling down. Then put the Chapati pieces into the mixer jar & grind well. Transfer the ground mixture to a parat/thali. Add some Rock Sugar Powder, Desiccated Coconut, Cardamom Powder, chopped & roasted Dry Fruit & Hot Ghee & mix all well. Keep some mixture on plastic polythene, and cover with half of the polythene.
