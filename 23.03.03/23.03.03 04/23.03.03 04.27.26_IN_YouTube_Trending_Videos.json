As neighboring countries that share a long and porous border, Pakistan and Afghanistan have a deeply intertwined history that has been marked by conflict, cooperation, and occasional periods of stability.\n\nIn this video, we delve into the key issues that have shaped the relationship between these two countries, from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s to the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s and the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. We also explore the role of regional and international actors in shaping the dynamic between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including India, Iran, China, and the United States.\n\nOur video features interviews with experts and analysts who provide insights into the complex geopolitical and security challenges facing both countries. We also examine the economic and cultural ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the ongoing efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.\n\nWhether you're a student of international relations, a history buff, or simply curious about the complex relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, our video is a must-watch.

'Taarak Mehta' (Sailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. 'Jethalaal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble.

Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalaal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises.\n\nClick here to watch the episode of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah :\nhttps://www.sonyliv.com/dplnk?schema=sony://asset/1000211529\n\nNEW!
