Kim has a “big life” full of tons of opinions but has somehow mastered remaining calm mentally and emotionally despite it all. She admits she doesn’t look at comments, is open to self-correction, and believes in the room for redemption but reveals that the robbery in Paris is what really shifted her values in a major way. \n\nEveryone is going through something in real life, Kim Kardashian included. In this episode, Kim shares how the memories of her own father help her keep it together for her kids and continue to be what leads her in her very complex co-parenting journey.  \n\nDespite all that’s happening around her, she makes time where there is often none, is dedicated to helping others, and admits to truly feeling at peace. Kim Kardashian is free, having fun, and enjoying dating, even if it means various forms of dating in the house. \n\nThis is an episode you won’t want to miss. \n\nWebsite: https://www.angiemartinez.com \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/angiemartinez (Follow) \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/angiemartinez (Follow) \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/officialangiemartinez (Like)",

            "description": "The 2022 Ford GT (US $660,845 when purchased) is so much more than a pretty face designed in a wind tunnel. It has a twin turbo V6 with 660 horsepower, lots of weight saving carbon fibre, and a rapidly-deploying suspension drop system along with an active rear wing that is as functional as it is dramatic. But how does it stack up against a 2023 Corvette C8 Z06 ($164,505 as specced in the US, $189,027 in Canada) which is but a fraction of the cost and has a high-revving naturally aspirated V8?

It was pretty awkward but it was a good test to see if she can handle working with crazy YouTubers.\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.

But, with the help of my wife, Vy Qwaint, I think we can build a pretty awesome indoor family entertainment center for everybody to enjoy.

You can tell he worked on the video because the animation was good lol. I'm working on building a team to be able to make more videos and Matt has been a huge help in that effort. I'm still learning how to build a team at all so there may be some growing pains but it's exciting that it's happening.\n\nAnyway this video is about an experience I had last summer. My friend invited me to go farm sit and that was a great and rare opportunity just plopped on my lap so I decided I really wanted to go. And so I did! There was a lot of new experiences gained from the trip, and in this video was the most notable ones. Italy is a beautiful place with really tasty food. I am certainly going back some day.

With the help of Gwen’s friends, including her lovable brother Nate, his smart, laser-focused girlfriend Nikki, the sarcastic and insightful Ozzie, and the charming Jay, Leia realizes adventure could happen there just like it did for her parents all those years ago. Excited to reinvent herself, she convinces her parents to let her stay for the summer. With a basement full of teens again, Kitty is happy the Forman house is now a home for a new generation and Red is, well...Red.\r\n\r\nThat ‘90s Show stars Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Callie Haverda, Ashley Aufderheide, Mace Coronel, Maxwell Donovan, Reyn Doi, and Sam Morelos.

Argentina showed aggressiveness early as Lionel Messi scored his first World Cup final goal on a penalty kick in 23’ and Ángel Di Maria added another goal in 36’. France made a surprising call after subbing out Olivier Giroud and Ousman Dembele in 40’. Mbappé would put the team on his back in the second half. He would score on a PK in 79’ and would score right after in 81’. The match would head to extra time. Lionel Messi would add another goal in 108’. Kylian Mbappé would add the equalizer in 118’ via PK.

            "description": "I’ve just disembarked what may be the shortest and weirdest cruise in history on a ship that was planned to be scrapped in 2020. She was saved from the scrapyard by a new British cruise line and I booked a 3 night mini break onboard the ship. \n \nOur cruise was cancelled 4 hours after we boarded and in total we were onboard this ship for about 8 hours, and during that time we had more problems than we would usually on a full two week cruise. The way that everything was handled was so bizarre I honestly think I’m still in shock. \n \nWe boarded the ship in London Tilbury and were planning on heading to Bruges to the Christmas markets. Embarkation was pretty easy and despite the bad weather we were really excited to get onboard. \n \nI picked up my cruise card which is the thing you use to get into your room, to buy drinks, pretty much everything onboard it’s very important. But my friends Justin and Tristan were told that they’d have to get theirs onboard as they weren’t ready yet, no big deal we thought, that isn’t uncommon on a cruise for things to be a bit delayed. The problem was much bigger than that but at this point we didn’t realise how widespread the problem was. \n \nAs soon as we embarked the ship we were in the middle of this beautiful Atrum, the ship was decorated for Christmas and looked amazing. Despite the ship being from 1991 everything here looked very new and I hoped that the rest of the ship would be as nice as this area. I didn’t have particularly high expectations after reading review after review online about broken toilets, broken air conditioning but this area definitely surpassed what I had expected. \n\nCruise Buoys Vlog: https://youtu.be/k8gPqPTbFgw\nSail Away With Dan and Jay Tour: https://youtu.be/XBCVVW75SGk\n \nOne of my favourite things about cruising is that feeling when you first get onboard a cruise ship and you run around exploring as fast as you can. Looking back I’m so glad that I did because I wouldn’t have a chance to later. We found a big pub area called The Purple Turtle which I’ve since found out used to be a casino. In the UK we don’t gamble as much as other places so if a British cruise line buys an American or Australian ship, they normally replace the big casino with one thats much smaller. \n \nThe ship was originally launched in 1991 for Princess cruises as Regal Princess and spent most of her life as Pacific Dawn for P&O Australia. As I was wandering around the main public areas I thought wow Ambassador have done a great job renovating these spaces, I’ve since had a look at P&O Dawn ship reviews and I think I should be giving a lot of the credit to P&O instead of Ambassador because most of the inside spaces haven’t changed, even the picture frames are the same in the big lounges. Not that that’s a bad thing, they didn’t need to be changed, P&O did a great job with these areas when they refit the ship back in 2017. \n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to exclusive perks like a weekly podcast and early ad free access to videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu4C8c3h9SKdkxnOwIAiHeA/join\n\n▶ Weekly Updates: http://EmmaCruises.com/News\n▶ Book a Cruise: https://EmmaCruises.com/Book-a-Cruise/\n\nLet’s Connect! \n▶ https://EmmaCruises.com/SocialLinks\n\n*** \n▶  Background World Map: https://emmacruises.com/map (Affiliate link)\n\nemma@emmacruises.com",

            "description": "Sponsor: Fractal Pop Air RGB Case on Amazon https://geni.us/TMxbP\nThe NVIDIA RTX 4080 has a problem: No one is buying it -- or at least, not enough people that board partners are feeling relief from their investment. They're on the hook for millions upon millions of dollars in inventory, and it's because NVIDIA's pricing structure is so egregiously bad that sales have finally slowed. NVIDIA got comfortable with a market where literally anything would sell, no exaggeration, and just existing would guarantee a sale. But that market is over, and now NVIDIA has an RTX 4080 problem. The other issue is that MSRP cards don't exist -- partners launched some, then stopped stocking them.\n\nWatch our tour of EVGA's GPU lab as it nears end of life: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr3lsU718Lg\nGrab a GN 3D 'Debug' Coaster pack!

                "description": "Sponsor: Fractal Pop Air RGB Case on Amazon https://geni.us/TMxbP\nThe NVIDIA RTX 4080 has a problem: No one is buying it -- or at least, not enough people that board partners are feeling relief from their investment. They're on the hook for millions upon millions of dollars in inventory, and it's because NVIDIA's pricing structure is so egregiously bad that sales have finally slowed. NVIDIA got comfortable with a market where literally anything would sell, no exaggeration, and just existing would guarantee a sale. But that market is over, and now NVIDIA has an RTX 4080 problem. The other issue is that MSRP cards don't exist -- partners launched some, then stopped stocking them.\n\nWatch our tour of EVGA's GPU lab as it nears end of life: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr3lsU718Lg\nGrab a GN 3D 'Debug' Coaster pack!
