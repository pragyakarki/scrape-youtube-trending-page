Brazil got a couple of shots on goal but nothing went through. The second half was more of the same with multiple Brazilian shots on goal but nothing would go through. That would all change in extra time when Neymar would put the team on his back and scored in 105’ + 1’. Croatia said not so fast and evened up the score Bruno Petković scored in 117’.

Brazil got a couple of shots on goal but nothing went through. The second half was more of the same with multiple Brazilian shots on goal but nothing would go through. That would all change in extra time when Neymar would put the team on his back and scored in 105’ + 1’. Croatia said not so fast and evened up the score Bruno Petković scored in 117’. Croatia would go on to win in PKs and would advance.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Croatia #Brazil \n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

Designed by brilliant toy-company roboticist Gemma (Get Out’s Allison Williams), M3GAN can listen and watch and learn as she becomes friend and teacher, playmate and protector, for the child she is bonded to. \n\nWhen Gemma suddenly becomes the caretaker of her orphaned 8-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw, The Haunting of Hill House), Gemma’s unsure and unprepared to be a parent.

Get 10% off your first month of therapy with our sponsor BetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/cinematherapy\n\nHow do you find happiness and purpose in life after loss?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are both crying because they’re reacting to Pixar’s Up. They talk about Carl’s reluctance to move on and find a new life without Ellie, and they cry watching the montage about their life. They talk about Pixar’s perfect screenplay and physical comedy, and they cry about that. They discuss how life can continue after loss, finding new joys and purpose, and Jonathan almost leaves and lets Alan do the show by himself because Up is his kryptonite.. Oh, and Michael Giacchino’s heart-wrenching score makes them cry too.\n\nJoin our Patreon: https://patreon.com/CinemaTherapy\n\nGet some popcorn here: https://www.lisaspopcorn.com/cinematherapy\n\nCinema Therapy is:\nWritten by: Megan Seawright, Jonathan Decker, and Alan Seawright\nProduced by: Jonathan Decker, Megan Seawright, Alan Seawright, Sophie Téllez, and Corinne Demyanovich\nEdited by: Trevor Horton\nDirector of Photography: Bradley Olsen\nEnglish Transcription by: Anna Preis",

            "description": "Explosions have reportedly hit a Russian airbase far from the Ukrainian border, damaging two long-range bombers. Unverified videos of the blasts have been posted on a variety of Telegram channels. \nThe blasts early Monday struck the airbase near the city of Engels, more than 600 kilometers inside Russian territory. The bombers damaged are said to be of the same type used to carry out airstrikes on Ukraine's infrastructure. Another explosion hit a military base near the Russian city of Ryazan. At least three people were reportedly killed after a fuel tank exploded. So far there has been no claim of responsibility for either of the blasts.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n#Russia #Ukraine #UkraineWar",
