Colin explains why he was rooting for Baker after being released earlier in the week from the Carolina Panthers, why this was an even bigger win than the Cleveland Browns' playoff win in 2020, and why Baker Mayfield now, at least momentarily, belongs in the same sentence as Tom Brady.\n\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://apple.co/36Mu3aC\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3BUHReE\n\nFollow Colin:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/colincowherd/\nhttps://twitter.com/ColinCowherd\n\nBet with us at FanDuel Sportsbook: \nhttps://www.fanduel.com/volume\n\nDownload the Action Network app:\nhttps://www.sw4trk.com/cmp/2989N1/27W1G/\n\nShop the hottest gear in all of sports podcasting: https://thevolume.com/shop-all-new\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/SubscribeToTheVolumeEmailNewsletter\n\nFollow us on social media: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/thevolumesports\nhttps://twitter.com/TheVolumeSports\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheVolumeSports\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@thevolumesports\n\nLearn more about the Volume:\nhttps://www.thevolume.com\n\n#nfl #rams #raiders #panthers #browns",

Designed by brilliant toy-company roboticist Gemma (Get Out’s Allison Williams), M3GAN can listen and watch and learn as she becomes friend and teacher, playmate and protector, for the child she is bonded to. \n\nWhen Gemma suddenly becomes the caretaker of her orphaned 8-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw, The Haunting of Hill House), Gemma’s unsure and unprepared to be a parent. Under intense pressure at work, Gemma decides to pair her M3GAN prototype with Cady in an attempt to resolve both problems—a decision that will have unimaginable consequences. \n\nProduced by Jason Blum and James Wan, M3GAN is directed by award-winning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone (Housebound), from a screenplay by Akela Cooper (Malignant, The Nun 2) based on a story by Akela Cooper and James Wan. \n\nThe film also stars Ronny Chieng (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings), Brian Jordan Alvarez (Will & Grace), Jen Van Epps (Cowboy Bebop), Lori Dungey (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, extended edition) and Stephane Garneau-Monten (Straight Forward).\n\nUniversal Pictures and Blumhouse present an Atomic Monster production in association with Divide/Conquer.

I’ve gone to great lengths to find out what it is like – from hiring 50 Spider-Man to training like Spiderman for 24 hours and spending 100 days as Spiderman in VR. Unfortunately, I just didn’t have the skills to cut it in any of these worlds so I went back to what I’m good at: building giant things! So in this video I built with world’s largest Spider-Man statue based off of a Spiderman Funko Pop and surprised @BaylenLevine with it!  This was insane and super intense to make, but I had lots of laughs along the way and it turned out incredible!!! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I have Spidey Senses!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Hired 50 Real Life Spider-Man, But I Trained With Spider-Man For 24 Hours, But I Actually Climbed A Building Like Spiderman, But Andrew Garfield Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions, But Most Popular Superheroes Ranked 2004 - 2021, But SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE, But Most spiders on the body - Guinness World Records, But Post Malone Sunflower, But Spidey and His Amazing Friends, But Tom Holland and Zendaya, But BIG SPIDER-MAN, But Hulk vs Spiderman, or any other video like FLAHO Junior, Disney Junior, Hello Sunday, Marvel, Dhar Mann, FaZe Rug, TD BRICKS, JStu, Unspeakable, aCookieGod, Craftee, SacredBricks, KreeksCraft, Cash, MrBeast, Typical Gamer, or Airrack would make.

I’ve gone to great lengths to find out what it is like – from hiring 50 Spider-Man to training like Spiderman for 24 hours and spending 100 days as Spiderman in VR. Unfortunately, I just didn’t have the skills to cut it in any of these worlds so I went back to what I’m good at: building giant things! So in this video I built with world’s largest Spider-Man statue based off of a Spiderman Funko Pop and surprised @BaylenLevine with it!  This was insane and super intense to make, but I had lots of laughs along the way and it turned out incredible!!! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I have Spidey Senses!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Hired 50 Real Life Spider-Man, But I Trained With Spider-Man For 24 Hours, But I Actually Climbed A Building Like Spiderman, But Andrew Garfield Answers the Web's Most Searched Questions, But Most Popular Superheroes Ranked 2004 - 2021, But SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE, But Most spiders on the body - Guinness World Records, But Post Malone Sunflower, But Spidey and His Amazing Friends, But Tom Holland and Zendaya, But BIG SPIDER-MAN, But Hulk vs Spiderman, or any other video like FLAHO Junior, Disney Junior, Hello Sunday, Marvel, Dhar Mann, FaZe Rug, TD BRICKS, JStu, Unspeakable, aCookieGod, Craftee, SacredBricks, KreeksCraft, Cash, MrBeast, Typical Gamer, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) built a Big Real Life Spider-Man Funko Pop and surprised Baylen Lavine with it!"

Get 10% off your first month of therapy with our sponsor BetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/cinematherapy\n\nHow do you find happiness and purpose in life after loss?\n\nLicensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are both crying because they’re reacting to Pixar’s Up. They talk about Carl’s reluctance to move on and find a new life without Ellie, and they cry watching the montage about their life. They talk about Pixar’s perfect screenplay and physical comedy, and they cry about that. They discuss how life can continue after loss, finding new joys and purpose, and Jonathan almost leaves and lets Alan do the show by himself because Up is his kryptonite.. Oh, and Michael Giacchino’s heart-wrenching score makes them cry too.\n\nJoin our Patreon: https://patreon.com/CinemaTherapy\n\nGet some popcorn here: https://www.lisaspopcorn.com/cinematherapy\n\nCinema Therapy is:\nWritten by: Megan Seawright, Jonathan Decker, and Alan Seawright\nProduced by: Jonathan Decker, Megan Seawright, Alan Seawright, Sophie Téllez, and Corinne Demyanovich\nEdited by: Trevor Horton\nDirector of Photography: Bradley Olsen\nEnglish Transcription by: Anna Preis"

Unverified videos of the blasts have been posted on a variety of Telegram channels. \nThe blasts early Monday struck the airbase near the city of Engels, more than 600 kilometers inside Russian territory. The bombers damaged are said to be of the same type used to carry out airstrikes on Ukraine's infrastructure. Another explosion hit a military base near the Russian city of Ryazan. At least three people were reportedly killed after a fuel tank exploded.

                "description": "Explosions have reportedly hit a Russian airbase far from the Ukrainian border, damaging two long-range bombers. Unverified videos of the blasts have been posted on a variety of Telegram channels. \nThe blasts early Monday struck the airbase near the city of Engels, more than 600 kilometers inside Russian territory. The bombers damaged are said to be of the same type used to carry out airstrikes on Ukraine's infrastructure. Another explosion hit a military base near the Russian city of Ryazan. At least three people were reportedly killed after a fuel tank exploded. So far there has been no claim of responsibility for either of the blasts.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/dwnews_hangout\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n#Russia #Ukraine #UkraineWar"
