Spread the word.\n\nQalandar Episode 42 - [Eng Sub] - Muneeb Butt - Komal Meer - Ali Abbas - Hiba Aziz - 4th March 2023 - HAR PAL GEO\n\nQalandar is a story of a girl’s firm belief in her God and His decisions while the rest of the world continues to hurt, defame and challenge her.\n\nDur-e-Adan is a young and innocent girl who has grown up under the care of her uncle and aunt. Despite being an orphan at an early age, Dur-e-Adan doesn’t complain about her challenges and difficulties.\n\nOn the contrary, Tabriz is a handsome young man who aspires to achieve great things in life. Living in the same locality, Tabriz’s parents find Dur-e-Adan suitable for him as a life partner. However, Tabriz’s life takes a surprising turn when Sumbul hailing from a wealthy family falls in love with him. In efforts to secure his future financially, Tabriz forgets the gift that he has been bestowed in the form of Dur-e-Adan for this world and hereafter. Soon, Tabriz’s half-heartedness and conflicting loyalties in the form of greed begins to reflect in his relationship with Dur-e-Adan.\n\nAmidst all the atrocities faced by Dur-e-Adan will she continue to be patient with those around her? Will Tabriz realize the respect and love that Dur-e-Adan deserves or will he continue to hurt her? Will Tabriz be able to mend his relationship with Dur-e-Adan?\n\nProduced By: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nHead of Project: Mikaal Zulfiqar\nWritten By: Samra Bukhari\nDirected By: Saima Waseem\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nMuneeb Butt as Tabrez\nKomal Meer as Dur-e-Adan\nAli Abbas as Irfan\nHiba Aziz as Sumbul\nAsma Abbas as Safiya\nKashif Mehmood as Yaqoob\nNoor ul Hassan as Ayub\nAli Hamza as Gullu\nAli Tahir as Ehsaan\nKinza Malik as Rahat\nAhmed Abbas as Tanveer\nHamna Amir as Sheena\nMaham Afzal Khuwaja as Aneela \nUsman Chaudhry as Haneef\nNaima Khan as Qudsia\nKinza Razzak as Shafaq\nSadoon Ali as Nomi\nHaira Muhammad as Azki\nFajar Khan as Johi\nAdeel Butt\n\n#qalandar \n#muneebbutt \n#komalmeer",

            "description": "Get our Red Following Love T shirt here: https://bit.ly/3C7SGeL\n\nIn this video, Abhi and Niyu discuss how Pakistan's focus on militarization of bordering areas contributed towards the current Pakistani Economic Crisis. \n\nWelcome to our latest video exploring the complex and often turbulent relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan. As neighboring countries that share a long and porous border, Pakistan and Afghanistan have a deeply intertwined history that has been marked by conflict, cooperation, and occasional periods of stability.\n\nIn this video, we delve into the key issues that have shaped the relationship between these two countries, from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s to the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s and the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. We also explore the role of regional and international actors in shaping the dynamic between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including India, Iran, China, and the United States.\n\nOur video features interviews with experts and analysts who provide insights into the complex geopolitical and security challenges facing both countries. We also examine the economic and cultural ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the ongoing efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.\n\nWhether you're a student of international relations, a history buff, or simply curious about the complex relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, our video is a must-watch.

Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family.

Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself. On the other hand, Meerab who is used to living her life on her own terms refuses to accept Murtasim’s family traditions and unnecessary social barriers.\n\nSoon their lives go through a series of emotional sufferings and misunderstandings where it becomes difficult for them to coexist.

Jetha becomes anxious as Iyer, Babita, and Ronita approach Gada Electronics. For any last-minute advice on how to get out of the predicament, he calls Taarak. Bagha urges Bawri not to call during business hours since he feels awful for his boss. Bawri is also instructed by Bagha to cease returning to Gada Electronics so frequently. Finally, Ronita shows up at the store and gives Jetha a bouquet of flowers for setting up the unique model of this TV. What will occur next? Will Jetha be required to lose his hair?

Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalaal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises.\n\nClick here to watch the episode of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah :\nhttps://www.sonyliv.com/dplnk?schema=sony://asset/1000211949\n\nNEW!

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Shailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Bhavya Gandhi / Raj Anadkat). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu.
