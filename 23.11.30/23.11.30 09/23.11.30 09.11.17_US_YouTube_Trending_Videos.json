And it is not just the US but around the world. People increasingly see themselves as part of opposing teams.\n\nThere are many different reasons for this, but one gets blamed a lot: social media. Social media divides us, makes us more extreme and less empathetic, it riles us up or sucks us into doom scrolling, making us stressed and depressed. It feels like we need to touch grass and escape to the real world. \n\nNew research shows that we might have largely misinterpreted why this is the case. It turns out that the social media internet may uniquely undermine the way our brains work but not in the way you think.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤ https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/47C0nrk\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/46QyCKt\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nrobek, Brad Christensen, Asija Newns, Pedro Castro Verdezoto, Lucas Watkins, damien perolle, Fab Cars, alomanola, MikyF2K, Mithilesh Hinge, okor, Lucan, The Gnome, Kyung Geun Kim, Misa Brass, Martin Hippenstiel, Morgan, Anthony Distel, Filip Rogowski, Gabe, Tobias Hofmann, Zaret, Bootools, David Earl, Ben Hamilton, still [Redacted], polyploidy, Elgenzay, Jared, Soda celeste, Felix, Benjamin Goodrich, Taher Rangwala, Jesse Barnes, WillowTree, DarkKot 686, Aaron Phillips, Luc Royal, Lukas Meier, esamoth, Smithius, Mermor, Laura Kühne, Tyler Fendone, gassi30, Andres Arce, Suzanne frounfelter, Akito Nozaki, SirRender, Space, Daniel Hofmeister, Dan M, Jacob Culp, ReyesX77, Aaron T Haltman, DJ Dubbes, SchnarcheNoah, Keira Standing, Steven Lamontagne, Bliss, David Anderson, Uhh Uhhh Uhhh, The Paul Family"

            "description": "How Xi Jinping became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nXi Jinping, president of China and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is one of the most powerful political figures in the world. By initiating an unprecedented third term as China’s leader in October, 2022, Xi has signaled that he may plan to remain in power for life – making him the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong to hold unchecked power over the People’s Republic of China. \n\nBut Xi’s connection to Mao goes deeper than a shared outlook that emphasizes unifying the party around a single leader. When Xi was just a young boy, his family – who had held elite party status thanks to his father’s pivotal role in Mao's “Long March” in 1935 – was denounced during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a chaotic decade of purges and persecution that saw even Mao’s closest allies removed from power. During this time, a teenaged Xi was forced to work hard labor in the countryside outside of Beijing, and his father was imprisoned. \n\nXi’s subsequent rise after Mao died in 1976 was a methodical process in using his restored elite status as leverage to gain prominent party positions in rural provinces around China, culminating in his promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007.\n\nFrom there, Xi pulled from Mao’s playbook: purging his political rivals and promoting those with whom he shared close personal ties. This process undid the work of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, to prevent the consolidation of power around a single leader in China. \n\nBy the time his third term began in October 2022, Xi had reshaped the party and Chinese military leadership to be fully packed with Xi loyalists. And even in the face of social upheaval surrounding his failed Zero Covid policy, Xi has shown no sign of giving up any of the power he has consolidated since taking over as leader of the country. \n\n\nFurther reading: \n\nThese books and podcasts below helped us understand Xi Jinping’s rise, Xi’s similarities to Mao, how politics changed in the PRC since its founding, and the structure and culture of the CCP:\n\nCoalitions of the Weak by Victor Shih (Associate Professor in China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego)\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/coalitions-of-the-weak/6E99B6DB73F934166175D872B51DACD0 \n\nChinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era by Cheng Li (scholar and expert in Chinese elite politics) \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/books/chinese-politics-in-the-xi-jinping-era/ \n\nParty of One by Chun Han Wong (Reporter at the Wall Street Journal) \nhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Party-of-One/Chun-Han-Wong/9781982185732\n\nWealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-first Century by Orville Schell and John Delury \nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/161758/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury/\n\nThe Prince by Sue-Lin Wong (Correspondent at The Economist) \nhttps://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-prince\n\nThese databases and papers were also helpful in gaining a better understanding of Xi Jinping’s alliances and the CCP structure under his terms: \n\nDecoding Chinese Politics interactive by Asia Society Policy Institute \nhttps://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/decoding-chinese-politics\n\nCCP Elite Database by UCSD/Victor Shih\nhttps://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/elites/\n\nChina’s Political System in Charts: A Snapshot Before the 20th Party Congress by Susan V.

            "description": "In the co-main event, Jermall Charlo returned to the ring for the first time in 29 months with a spirited, workmanlike and ultimately dominant performance against a very game and durable José Benavídez Jr., the older brother of David Benavídez in their 10-round non-title bout contracted at 163 pounds. Charlo, who holds the WBC middleweight title, was the much larger man, and he pushed Benavídez around the ring with his pole-like jab and hard right hands. It all added up to a wide decision for Charlo by scores of 100-90, 99-91 and 98-92 as Charlo remained undefeated at 33-0 with 22 KOs, while Benavídez dropped to 28-3-1 with 19 KOs. Charlo weighed in at 166.4 pounds at Friday’s weigh-in, compared to Benavídez at 161.2 pounds, but the fight was allowed to continue after both camps agreed. Charlo landed 116 of 334 total jabs for a 35% connect-rate and landed 127 of 279 power punches for a 46% clip.\n\n“I'll be back stronger, just know that,” Charlo said. “I thought about everything that I've been through every round. God's got me. I want to thank everybody who never left my side. I want to thank Al Haymon for understanding me. I know when you're a man it's hard to explain to somebody what you stand for, but I'm happy that I went through what I went through because I showed myself that anything can be done.”\n\nBenavídez, who was stopped by Terence Crawford in the 12th round for a welterweight title in 2018 and was an amateur prodigy, performed well against the larger foe, displaying a granite chin. But after a rusty first round, Charlo took control, exhibiting the skills that have made him one of the most entertaining and skilled fighters in the sport.\n\n“He’s a good fighter, I’m not going to make any excuses,” Benavídez said. “I came to fight. He said he was going to back me up and I didn’t back up. I kept coming forward. The best man won tonight. It’s boxing. I thought it was way closer than the judges said it was. At the end of the day, I lost, and I’m not going to make any excuses. I don’t know if his extra weight had anything to do with it. Maybe. Maybe not. I came prepared. I gave my best.”\n\nCharlo hurt Benavídez with a straight right hand toward the end of the first round after Charlo started slowly, the result of his long layoff. Charlo landed a sharp right uppercut midway through the second. Benavídez briefly hurt Charlo to start the third with a jab-right hand combination, but Charlo responded with an overhand right that snapped Benavídez’s head back with a minute left in the frame, and Charlo unloaded on Benavídez in the fourth as Benavídez covered up under Charlo’s heavy jabs and lefts. Charlo snapped Benavídez’s head back with a right uppercut with 40 seconds left in the sixth, and Charlo hurt Benavídez in the 10th round with a snappy right, as the two exchanged words and eventually buried the bad blood between them when the fight was over and embraced.\n\n#JermallCharlo #CharloBenavidez #JoseBenavidezJr \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

            "title": "Benavidez vs Andrade HIGHLIGHTS: November 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV",
            "description": "David “El Monstruo” Benavídez lived up to his nickname and billings as perhaps the sport’s most destructive offensive weapon as he defended his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title and blitzed former two-division champion Demetrius “Boo Boo” Andrade with a stoppage after the sixth round in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night headlining a Premier Boxing Champions event from Michelob ULTRA Arena at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.\n \nThe ending came after Andrade’s trainer wouldn’t allow their charge to leave the corner to start the seventh round after Benavidez, fighting his first southpaw in seven years, bloodied and pounded Andrade in perhaps the signature performance of his career. Benavídez (28-0, 24 KOs) remained undefeated as Andrade (32-1, 19 KOs) suffered his first loss.\n \n“I think I just solidified myself as a dominant force here,” Benavídez said. “I just reminded everyone who the real champion at 168 is. Who wants to see me versus Canelo? I'm going to be super middleweight champion of the world, three-time world champion. Now just give me the fight that we all want to see. Who wants to see Benavídez versus Canelo?”\n \nBenavídez punctuated his performance with an embrace of Mike Tyson outside the ring following the stoppage. Tyson famously dubbed Benavídez the “Mexican Monster.”\n \n\"I just told Mike Tyson that I love him and thank you so much for the motivation he's given me,” Benavídez said. “It's not every day a boxing legend like Mike Tyson gives people nicknames, so I just want to live up to my name.\n \n“Everybody says I'm not this, I'm not that, I'm flat-footed, I have no defense. This guy probably applied one of the best defenses. He's really good offensively. He could barely even hit me, so I think that says a lot on its own. I just have to keep beating who they put in front of me. I'm the best. I'm going to be the best. I'm going to be a legend by the time I'm done, so whoever you keep putting in front of me, I'll keep knocking them down.\n \n\"Let's give the people what they want to see. They want to see Benavídez versus Canelo.\"\n \nJust as he did against Caleb Plant in March, Benavídez grew stronger and more dangerous as the fight wore on. After Andrade held his own in the opening rounds, Benavídez broke down his 35-year-old opponent with breathtaking efficiently. A looping right hand from Benavídez to the side of the head dropped Andrade for the third time in his career with seconds left in the fourth round. Andrade crumpled to the canvas and rose on shaky legs to survive the round.\n \nBenavídez hurt Andrade again with a left to start the fifth round as he continued to walk Andrade down and land hard punches. Andrade’s right eye started to close midway through the frame as Benavídez teed off on his 35-year-old opponent with a right uppercut and an assortment of short, stinging punches. Andrade took a stand with a minute left in the sixth, uncorking a right uppercut but Benavidez hurt Andrade, a former 2008 U.S. Olympian, with left that had him stumbling across the ring.\n \nIt was a far cry from the start of the fight when Andrade was able to smother Benavídez’s punches, darting in and out and winging shots from odd angles that found their mark. Andrade looked sensational in the first two rounds, while Benavídez bided his time, carefully picking his shots. Andrade started to slow down in the third, allowing Benavídez to unload his brand of destructive, compact punches before the knockdown turned the tide in Benavídez’s favor.  \n \n“I’ll be back – back to the drawing board,” Andrade said. “I moved up in weight classes. I’ll work on my body a little more and I’ll be right back at it. I thought overall I did everything I needed to do to get the bigger man off me. David's definitely a hell of a fighter. Nobody was even willing to get in the ring with him. I tried to become a three-division world champion. That's not far-fetched. David was the man tonight. Benavídez is the bigger man.”\n\n#BenavidezAndrade #DavidBenavidez #DemetriusAndrade \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

            "description": "HELLO FRIENDS!! So, I found something... a few months ago, while we were trying to film a video where I let TikTok ads pick my outfits, I stumbled upon... this dress. It goes by a few names but it's most commonly some version of the \"floral midriff shaper corset sundress\" - and after buying one for the video, my for you page started getting flooded with TONS of ads for what looked like the same dress - but all from different companies, and with wildly different price points. So, I decided - let's buy a few of these bad boys and see what actually ends up at our doorstep - and find out, what the heck IS up. Where are all these dresses coming from? Are they all the same dress? Clearly someone is lying here - but who? I guess we'll find out...\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!! \n\nCheck out our merch shop here! https://fiendishbehavior.com \n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw \nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig \n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nExecutive Producers: Safiya Nygaard & Tyler Williams\nHead of Production: Carey Fiock\nProduction Manager / Producer: Melissa Douglas\nJunior Associate Producer: Ishara Mathews\nProduction Assistant: Aayanah McCreary\nContent Promotions & Video Packaging Manager: Alaina Simmons\nShort Form Producer: Myia Lambe\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Mandy Padgett\nAssistant Editor: Hailey Cox\nGraphic Designer: Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n2:06 The Dress That Started It All: LarRobe\n4:51 Scam Websites??

            "description": "She's probably the most powerful woman in North Korea: Kim Yo Jong, the dictator’s younger sister. She’s viewed as an emotionless and shrewd strategist for her brother, the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un. But just who is the \"Red Princess\"?\n\nKim Jong Un’s rise began in 2011 when their father, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il died at the age of 69. His death triggered emotional scenes including, at the funeral, that of a weeping woman who captured the attention of her country and the entire world: Kim Yo Jong.\n\nThis was Kim Yo Jong’s first official appearance alongside her brother Kim Jong Un, the new Supreme Leader of North Korea. Within a decade, Kim Yo Jong became the second highest ranking person in the Pyongyang regime and thereby her brother’s potential successor.\n\nKim Yo Jong holds a multifaceted political role: on the one hand, she knows where and when to deploy her charm -- such as on a visit to South Korea in 2018. But she also issues warnings against the \"imperialists” of Seoul and Washington. The documentary examines the personality and the career of the \"Red Princess”. It also takes a current look behind the scenes of this totalitarian regime. The nuclear power is mired in a crisis that originated at the outset of the Cold War.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

            "title": "Hundreds of 5-Star Reviews!! Famous Traditional Irish Beef Stew Recipe",
            "description": "There’s no greater comfort food than a hearty stew. And Irish Beef and Guinness Stew might be the king of them all! Guinness beer gives the sauce an incredible rich, deep flavour, and the beef is fall-apart tender. \nIrish Stew is one amazing stew. You already know that anything simmered for hours is bound to be delicious. But this... this is the stew you've always dreamed of. It's the one I make when I have guests over and want to truly impress them!\nThe key ingredient that gives Guinness Stew its rich flavor and deep color is Guinness Beer. And don't worry, the dish doesn't taste like beer at all! It transforms into a savory sauce that is absolutely mouthwatering. Plus, all the alcohol cooks out, so you won't be left with any boozy taste. Adding bacon to the stew is optional, but it definitely adds extra flavor. So go ahead and indulge if you'd like. Either way, you're in for a truly special stew. Try this delicious dish and comment how do you like it! Have a delicious day! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n2 tbsp Olive oil\n2lb / 900g beef \nSeason with salt and black pepper\n2 garlic cloves\n2 onions \n6 oz / 170g bacon\n2 carrots\n2 celery stalks\n3 tbsp flour \n14.9 oz  / 440ml Guinness Beer \n3 tbsp tomato paste\n3 cups / 750 ml broth \n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp thyme \n\n🤩 Knives I used in this video -  https://amzn.to/3QILFYm\nhttps://amzn.to/46fFUqy\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Start by cutting the beef into big chunks, approximatelly 4-5cm.\n2. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot (cast iron dutch oven) over high heat. Add the beef in batches and brown it well on all sides. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the beef. Once browned, transfer the beef onto a plate and repeat with the remaining batch of beef.\n3. Lower the heat to medium. Cook the garlic and onion for about 2 minutes until they start to soften. Then, add the bacon and continue cooking until the bacon is browned.\n4. Stir in the carrot and celery, and cook for a few more minutes.\n5. Add the flour to the pot and stir for 1 minute to cook off the flour.\n6. Pour in the Guinness, broth and tomato paste. Mix well to ensure the flour dissolves completely. Add the bay leaves and thyme.\n7. Return the beef and any accumulated juices back into the pot. The liquid level should just cover the ingredients.\n8. Cover the pot and lower the heat to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for 2 hours until the beef is tender. Then, remove the lid and simmer for an additional 45 minutes, or until the beef easily falls apart and the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.\nServe the beef and Guinness stew with pasta, mashed potatoes or whatever you like. Enjoy!\n\n\nMy friends if you liked this video you can help to grow the channel:\n\nRate the video! 👍 - I will be very happy and it will help the development of the channel.\n\nWRITE A COMMENT or ask me a question about the recipe.

                "title": "Hundreds of 5-Star Reviews!! Famous Traditional Irish Beef Stew Recipe",
                "description": "There’s no greater comfort food than a hearty stew. And Irish Beef and Guinness Stew might be the king of them all! Guinness beer gives the sauce an incredible rich, deep flavour, and the beef is fall-apart tender. \nIrish Stew is one amazing stew. You already know that anything simmered for hours is bound to be delicious. But this... this is the stew you've always dreamed of. It's the one I make when I have guests over and want to truly impress them!\nThe key ingredient that gives Guinness Stew its rich flavor and deep color is Guinness Beer. And don't worry, the dish doesn't taste like beer at all! It transforms into a savory sauce that is absolutely mouthwatering. Plus, all the alcohol cooks out, so you won't be left with any boozy taste. Adding bacon to the stew is optional, but it definitely adds extra flavor. So go ahead and indulge if you'd like. Either way, you're in for a truly special stew. Try this delicious dish and comment how do you like it! Have a delicious day! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n2 tbsp Olive oil\n2lb / 900g beef \nSeason with salt and black pepper\n2 garlic cloves\n2 onions \n6 oz / 170g bacon\n2 carrots\n2 celery stalks\n3 tbsp flour \n14.9 oz  / 440ml Guinness Beer \n3 tbsp tomato paste\n3 cups / 750 ml broth \n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp thyme \n\n🤩 Knives I used in this video -  https://amzn.to/3QILFYm\nhttps://amzn.to/46fFUqy\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Start by cutting the beef into big chunks, approximatelly 4-5cm.\n2. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot (cast iron dutch oven) over high heat. Add the beef in batches and brown it well on all sides. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the beef. Once browned, transfer the beef onto a plate and repeat with the remaining batch of beef.\n3. Lower the heat to medium. Cook the garlic and onion for about 2 minutes until they start to soften. Then, add the bacon and continue cooking until the bacon is browned.\n4. Stir in the carrot and celery, and cook for a few more minutes.\n5. Add the flour to the pot and stir for 1 minute to cook off the flour.\n6. Pour in the Guinness, broth and tomato paste. Mix well to ensure the flour dissolves completely. Add the bay leaves and thyme.\n7. Return the beef and any accumulated juices back into the pot. The liquid level should just cover the ingredients.\n8. Cover the pot and lower the heat to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for 2 hours until the beef is tender. Then, remove the lid and simmer for an additional 45 minutes, or until the beef easily falls apart and the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.\nServe the beef and Guinness stew with pasta, mashed potatoes or whatever you like.

                "description": "Ei ole parempaa lohdullista ruokaa kuin runsas muhennos. Ja irlantilainen naudanliha ja Guinness Stew saattavat olla heidän kaikkien kuningas! Guinness-olut antaa kastikkeelle uskomattoman täyteläisen, syvän maun, ja naudanliha on murenevaa.\nIrish Stew on yksi hämmästyttävä muhennos. Tiedät jo, että kaikki tuntikausia kiehuva on varmasti herkullista. Mutta tämä... tämä on muhennos, josta olet aina haaveillut. Se on se, jonka teen, kun minulla on vieraita ja haluan tehdä heihin todella vaikutuksen!\nGuinness Beer on tärkein ainesosa, joka antaa Guinness Stewlle sen täyteläisen maun ja syvän värin. Ja älä huoli, ruokalaji ei maistu ollenkaan oluelta! Se muuttuu suolaiseksi kastikkeeksi, joka on ehdottoman suussa sulava. Lisäksi kaikki alkoholi kypsyy pois, joten sinulle ei jää viinaa. Pekonin lisääminen muhennokseen on valinnaista, mutta se antaa ehdottomasti lisämakua. Joten mene eteenpäin ja nauti, jos haluat. Joka tapauksessa sinulla on edessäsi todella erityinen muhennos. Kokeile tätä herkullista ruokaa ja kommentoi mitä pidit siitä! Herkullista päivää! 🥰😍🤗\n\nAINESOSAT:\n2 rkl Oliiviöljyä\n2 lb / 900 g naudanlihaa\nMausta suolalla ja mustapippurilla\n2 valkosipulinkynttä\n2 sipulia\n6 unssia / 170 g pekonia\n2 porkkanaa\n2 sellerinvartta\n3 rkl jauhoja\n14,9 unssia / 440 ml Guinness-olutta\n3 rkl tomaattipyrettä\n3 kuppia / 750 ml lientä\n2 laakerinlehteä\n1 tl timjamia\n\n\nOHJEET:\n1. Aloita leikkaamalla naudanliha isoiksi paloiksi, noin 4-5 cm.\n2. Kuumenna öljy paksupohjaisessa kattilassa (hollantilainen valurautauuni) korkealla lämmöllä. Lisää naudanliha erissä ja ruskista se hyvin joka puolelta. Ripottele lihan päälle suolaa ja pippuria. Kun naudanliha on ruskistunut, siirrä liha lautaselle ja toista lopun naudanlihaerän kanssa.\n3. Alenna lämpöä keskitasolle. Paista valkosipulia ja sipulia noin 2 minuuttia, kunnes ne alkavat pehmetä. Lisää sitten pekoni ja jatka kypsentämistä, kunnes pekoni on ruskea.\n4. Sekoita joukkoon porkkana ja selleri ja keitä vielä muutama minuutti.\n5. Lisää jauhot kattilaan ja sekoita 1 minuutti, jotta jauhot kypsyvät.\n6. Kaada joukkoon Guinness, liemi ja tomaattipyree. Sekoita hyvin, jotta jauhot liukenevat kokonaan. Lisää laakerinlehdet ja timjami.\n7. Palauta naudanliha ja kertyneet mehut takaisin kattilaan. Nestepinnan tulee juuri peittää ainekset.\n8. Peitä kattila ja alenna lämpöä miedolla lämmöllä. Anna kypsyä 2 tuntia, kunnes liha on kypsää. Poista sitten kansi ja keitä vielä 45 minuuttia tai kunnes naudanliha hajoaa helposti ja kastike on haihtunut ja sakeutunut hieman.\nTarjoile naudanliha ja Guinness-pata pastan, perunamuusin tai minkä tahansa muun kanssa. Nauttia!\n\n\nYstäväni, jos pidit tästä videosta, voit auttaa kasvattamaan kanavaa:\n\nArvioi video! 👍 - Olen erittäin iloinen ja se auttaa kanavan kehitystä.\n\nKIRJOITA KOMMENTOI tai kysy minulta reseptiä.

At huwag mag-alala, ang ulam ay hindi lasa tulad ng beer! Nagbabago ito sa isang malasang sarsa na talagang katakam-takam.

Kaya sige at magpakasawa kung gusto mo. Alinmang paraan, ikaw ay nasa para sa isang tunay na espesyal na nilagang. Subukan ang masarap na ulam na ito at magkomento kung paano mo ito nagustuhan!

                "title": "Hundreds of 5-Star Reviews!! Famous Traditional Irish Beef Stew Recipe",
                "description": "There’s no greater comfort food than a hearty stew. And Irish Beef and Guinness Stew might be the king of them all! Guinness beer gives the sauce an incredible rich, deep flavour, and the beef is fall-apart tender. \nIrish Stew is one amazing stew. You already know that anything simmered for hours is bound to be delicious. But this... this is the stew you've always dreamed of. It's the one I make when I have guests over and want to truly impress them!\nThe key ingredient that gives Guinness Stew its rich flavor and deep color is Guinness Beer. And don't worry, the dish doesn't taste like beer at all! It transforms into a savory sauce that is absolutely mouthwatering. Plus, all the alcohol cooks out, so you won't be left with any boozy taste. Adding bacon to the stew is optional, but it definitely adds extra flavor. So go ahead and indulge if you'd like. Either way, you're in for a truly special stew. Try this delicious dish and comment how do you like it! Have a delicious day! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n2 tbsp Olive oil\n2lb / 900g beef \nSeason with salt and black pepper\n2 garlic cloves\n2 onions \n6 oz / 170g bacon\n2 carrots\n2 celery stalks\n3 tbsp flour \n14.9 oz  / 440ml Guinness Beer \n3 tbsp tomato paste\n3 cups / 750 ml broth \n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp thyme \n\n🤩 Knives I used in this video -  https://amzn.to/3QILFYm\nhttps://amzn.to/46fFUqy\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Start by cutting the beef into big chunks, approximatelly 4-5cm.\n2. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot (cast iron dutch oven) over high heat. Add the beef in batches and brown it well on all sides. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the beef. Once browned, transfer the beef onto a plate and repeat with the remaining batch of beef.\n3. Lower the heat to medium. Cook the garlic and onion for about 2 minutes until they start to soften. Then, add the bacon and continue cooking until the bacon is browned.\n4. Stir in the carrot and celery, and cook for a few more minutes.\n5. Add the flour to the pot and stir for 1 minute to cook off the flour.\n6. Pour in the Guinness, broth and tomato paste. Mix well to ensure the flour dissolves completely. Add the bay leaves and thyme.\n7. Return the beef and any accumulated juices back into the pot. The liquid level should just cover the ingredients.\n8. Cover the pot and lower the heat to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for 2 hours until the beef is tender. Then, remove the lid and simmer for an additional 45 minutes, or until the beef easily falls apart and the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.\nServe the beef and Guinness stew with pasta, mashed potatoes or whatever you like.

                "title": "Stotine recenzija s 5 zvjezdica!! Poznati recept za tradicionalni irski goveđi gulaš",
                "description": "Nema bolje utješne hrane od krepkog gulaša. A irska govedina i Guinnessov gulaš mogli bi biti kralj svih njih! Guinnessovo pivo daje umaku nevjerojatno bogat, dubok okus, a govedina je mekana na raspadanje.\nIrski gulaš je jedan nevjerojatan gulaš. Već znate da sve što se kuha satima mora biti ukusno. Ali ovo... ovo je gulaš o kojem ste oduvijek sanjali. To je onaj koji radim kad imam goste i želim ih doista impresionirati!\nKljučni sastojak koji Guinnessovom gulašu daje bogat okus i duboku boju je Guinnessovo pivo. I ne brinite, jelo uopće nema okus piva! Pretvara se u slani umak koji je apsolutno slasan. Osim toga, sav alkohol se skuha, tako da nećete ostati bez okusa pića. Dodavanje slanine u gulaš nije obavezno, ali svakako daje dodatni okus. Pa samo naprijed i prepustite se ako želite. U svakom slučaju, čeka vas uistinu poseban gulaš. Probajte ovo ukusno jelo i komentirajte kako vam se sviđa! Ugodan dan! 🥰😍🤗\n\nSASTOJCI:\n2 žlice maslinovog ulja\n2 lb / 900 g govedine\nZačinite solju i crnim paprom\n2 češnja češnjaka\n2 luka\n6 oz / 170 g slanine\n2 mrkve\n2 stabljike celera\n3 žlice brašna\n14,9 oz / 440 ml Guinness pivo\n3 žlice paste od rajčice\n3 šalice / 750 ml temeljca\n2 lista lovora\n1 žličica majčine dušice\n\n\nUPUTE:\n1. Započnite rezanjem govedine na velike komade, otprilike 4-5 cm.\n2. Zagrijte ulje u loncu s debelim dnom (pećnica od lijevanog željeza) na jakoj vatri. Dodajte govedinu u serijama i dobro je zapecite sa svih strana. Govedinu pospite solju i paprom. Nakon što porumeni, prebacite govedinu na tanjur i ponovite s preostalom količinom govedine.\n3. Smanjite vatru na srednju. Kuhajte češnjak i luk oko 2 minute dok ne počnu omekšavati. Zatim dodajte slaninu i nastavite kuhati dok slanina ne porumeni.\n4. Umiješajte mrkvu i celer, pa kuhajte još par minuta.\n5. Dodajte brašno u lonac i miješajte 1 minutu da se brašno skuha.\n6. Ulijte Guinness, juhu i pastu od rajčice. Dobro promiješajte kako biste osigurali da se brašno potpuno otopi. Dodajte listove lovora i timijan.\n7. Vratite govedinu i sve nakupljene sokove natrag u lonac. Razina tekućine treba samo pokrivati sastojke.\n8. Pokrijte lonac i smanjite vatru da lagano krčka. Neka se kuha 2 sata dok govedina ne omekša. Zatim maknite poklopac i pirjajte dodatnih 45 minuta, ili dok se govedina lako ne raspadne, a umak se malo smanji i zgusne.\nGoveđi i Guinnessov gulaš poslužite uz tjesteninu, pire krumpir ili što već volite. Uživati!\n\n\nPrijatelji moji ako vam se svidio ovaj video možete pomoći u razvoju kanala:\n\nOcijenite video! 👍 - Bit će mi jako drago i to će pomoći razvoju kanala.\n\nNAPIŠITE KOMENTAR ili mi postavite pitanje o receptu.

                "title": "Сотні 5-зіркових відгуків!! Відомий рецепт традиційної ірландської тушкованої яловичини",
                "description": "Немає кращої їжі, ніж ситне рагу. Ірландська яловичина та тушковане м’ясо Гіннесса можуть бути королем усіх! Пиво Guinness надає соусу неймовірно насичений, глибокий смак, а яловичина стає ніжною на частини.\nІрландське рагу - це дивовижне рагу. Ви вже знаєте, що все, що гаситься годинами, обов’язково буде смачним. Але це... це рагу, про яке ви завжди мріяли. Це той, який я готую, коли маю гостей і хочу справді їх вразити!\nКлючовим інгредієнтом, який надає Guinness Raw насичений смак і глибокий колір, є пиво Guinness. І не переживайте, на смак страва зовсім не схожа на пиво! Він перетворюється на пікантний соус, який справді захоплює рот. Крім того, весь алкоголь випарується, тож у вас не залишиться жодного випивного смаку. Додавання бекону в рагу необов’язкове, але це точно додає додатковий смак. Тож побалуйте себе, якщо хочете. У будь-якому випадку вас чекає справді особливе рагу. Спробуйте цю смачну страву та напишіть, як вам це подобається! Смачного дня! 🥰😍🤗\n\nІНГРЕДІЄНТИ:\n2 столові ложки оливкової олії\n2 фунта / 900 г яловичини\nПриправити сіллю і чорним перцем\n2 зубчики часнику\n2 цибулини\n6 унцій / 170 г бекону\n2 морквини\n2 стебла селери\n3 ст.л борошна\n14,9 унцій / 440 мл пива Guinness\n3 ст ложки томатної пасти\n3 склянки / 750 мл бульйону\n2 лаврових листки\n1 ч. Л. чебрецю\n\n\nІНСТРУКЦІЇ:\n1. Почніть з того, що наріжте яловичину великими шматками, приблизно 4-5 см.\n2. Розігрійте олію в каструлі з товстим дном (чавунна духовка) на сильному вогні. Порціями додайте яловичину і добре обсмажте її з усіх боків. Посипте яловичину сіллю та перцем. Після того, як яловичина підрум’яниться, перекладіть яловичину на тарілку та повторіть з рештою порції яловичини.\n3. Зменшіть вогонь до середнього. Готуйте часник і цибулю приблизно 2 хвилини, поки вони не почнуть розм’якшуватися. Потім додайте бекон і продовжуйте готувати, поки бекон не підрум’яниться.\n4. Додайте моркву та селеру та готуйте ще кілька хвилин.\n5. Додайте борошно в каструлю і перемішуйте протягом 1 хвилини, щоб зварити борошно.\n6. Влийте Гіннес, бульйон і томатну пасту. Добре перемішайте, щоб борошно повністю розчинилося. Додайте лавровий лист і чебрець.\n7. Поверніть яловичину та весь накопичений сік назад у каструлю. Рівень рідини повинен покривати інгредієнти.\n8. Накрийте каструлю та зменшіть вогонь до слабкого кипіння. Дайте варитися 2 години, поки яловичина не стане м’якою. Потім зніміть кришку і тушкуйте ще 45 хвилин або доки яловичина легко не розпадеться, а соус трохи не загусне.\nПодавайте яловичину та тушковане м’ясо Гіннеса з макаронами, картопляним пюре або чим завгодно. Насолоджуйтесь!\n\n\nДрузі, якщо вам сподобалося це відео, ви можете допомогти розвивати канал:\n\nОцініть відео! 👍 - Буду дуже рада і це допоможе розвитку каналу.\n\nНАПИШІТЬ КОМЕНТАР або задайте мені питання про рецепт.

Pivo Guinness dodává omáčce neuvěřitelně bohatou, hlubokou chuť a hovězí maso je křehké.\nIrish Stew je úžasný guláš. Už víte, že vše, co se louhuje celé hodiny, musí být chutné. Ale tohle... tohle je guláš, o kterém jsi vždycky snil. Je to ten, který dělám, když mám hosty a chci na ně opravdu zapůsobit!\nKlíčovou složkou, která dává Guinness Stew jeho bohatou chuť a hlubokou barvu, je pivo Guinness. A nebojte se, pokrm vůbec nechutná jako pivo! Promění se v pikantní omáčku, která je naprosto lahodná. Navíc se všechen alkohol vyvaří, takže vám nezůstane žádná pachuť chlastu. Přidání slaniny do guláše je volitelné, ale rozhodně to přidá extra chuť. Takže do toho a dopřejte si, jestli chcete. Ať tak či onak, čeká vás opravdu speciální guláš.

Začněte nakrájením hovězího masa na velké kousky, přibližně 4-5 cm.\n2. V hrnci se silným dnem (litinová holandská trouba) rozehřejte olej na vysokou teplotu. Po dávkách přidejte hovězí maso a ze všech stran ho dobře opečte. Hovězí maso posypte solí a pepřem. Jakmile zhnědne, přendejte hovězí maso na talíř a opakujte se zbývající dávkou hovězího masa.\n3. Snižte teplotu na střední. Česnek a cibuli vařte asi 2 minuty, dokud nezačnou měknout. Poté přidejte slaninu a pokračujte ve vaření, dokud slanina nezhnědne.\n4. Vmíchejte mrkev a celer a ještě pár minut povařte.\n5. Do hrnce přidejte mouku a míchejte 1 minutu, aby se mouka uvařila.\n6. Nalijte Guinness, vývar a rajčatovou pastu. Dobře promíchejte, aby se mouka úplně rozpustila. Přidejte bobkové listy a tymián.\n7. Hovězí maso a případnou nahromaděnou šťávu vraťte zpět do hrnce. Hladina kapaliny by měla pouze pokrývat přísady.\n8. Hrnec přikryjte a snižte plamen na mírný plamen. Necháme vařit 2 hodiny, dokud hovězí maso nezměkne. Poté sejměte poklici a vařte dalších 45 minut, nebo dokud se hovězí maso snadno nerozpadne a omáčka se nezredukuje a mírně zhoustne.\nHovězí maso a Guinness guinness podávejte s těstovinami, bramborovou kaší nebo čímkoli, co máte rádi.

                "title": "Hundredvis af 5-stjernede anmeldelser!! Berømt traditionel irsk oksekødsgryderet opskrift",
                "description": "Der er ingen større komfortmad end en solid gryderet. Og Irish Beef and Guinness Stew er måske kongen af dem alle! Guinness-øl giver saucen en utrolig rig, dyb smag, og oksekødet er mørt.\nIrish Stew er en fantastisk gryderet. Du ved allerede, at alt, der simrer i timevis, vil være lækkert. Men det her... dette er gryderet, du altid har drømt om. Det er den, jeg laver, når jeg har gæster forbi og virkelig vil imponere dem!\nNøgleingrediensen, der giver Guinness Stew sin rige smag og dybe farve, er Guinness Beer. Og bare rolig, retten smager slet ikke af øl! Det forvandles til en velsmagende sauce, der er absolut læskende. Plus, al alkoholen koger ud, så du vil ikke stå tilbage med nogen sprudlende smag. Tilføjelse af bacon til gryderet er valgfrit, men det giver helt sikkert ekstra smag. Så gå videre og forkæl dig selv, hvis du har lyst. Uanset hvad, er du ude efter en helt speciel gryderet. Prøv denne lækre ret og kommenter, hvordan kan du lide den! Hav en lækker dag! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENSER:\n2 spsk Olivenolie\n2lb / 900g oksekød\nSmag til med salt og sort peber\n2 fed hvidløg\n2 løg\n6 oz / 170 g bacon\n2 gulerødder\n2 selleristængler\n3 spsk mel\n14,9 oz / 440 ml Guinness-øl\n3 spsk tomatpure\n3 kopper / 750 ml bouillon\n2 laurbærblade\n1 tsk timian\n\n\nINSTRUKTIONER:\n1. Start med at skære oksekødet i store stykker, ca. 4-5 cm.\n2. Varm olie op i en tykbundet gryde (støbejern hollandsk ovn) ved høj varme. Tilsæt oksekødet i omgange og brun det godt af på alle sider. Drys salt og peber over oksekødet. Når det er brunet, overføres oksekødet til en tallerken og gentages med den resterende omgang oksekød.\n3. Sænk varmen til medium. Kog hvidløg og løg i cirka 2 minutter, indtil de begynder at blive bløde. Tilsæt derefter baconen og fortsæt med at stege, indtil baconen er brunet.\n4. Rør gulerod og selleri i, og kog et par minutter mere.\n5. Tilsæt melet i gryden og rør i 1 minut for at koge melet af.\n6. Hæld Guinness, bouillon og tomatpure i. Bland godt for at sikre, at melet opløses helt. Tilsæt laurbærblade og timian.\n7. Kom oksekødet og eventuel ophobet saft tilbage i gryden. Væskeniveauet skal lige dække ingredienserne.\n8. Dæk gryden til, og sænk varmen til en let simre. Lad det stege i 2 timer til oksekødet er mørt. Fjern derefter låget og lad det simre i yderligere 45 minutter, eller indtil oksekødet let falder fra hinanden, og saucen er reduceret og tyknet lidt.\nServer oksekød og Guinness gryderet med pasta, kartoffelmos eller hvad du nu har lyst til. God fornøjelse!\n\n\nMine venner, hvis du kunne lide denne video, kan du hjælpe med at udvikle kanalen:\n\nBedøm videoen! 👍 - Jeg bliver meget glad, og det vil hjælpe på udviklingen af kanalen.\n\nSKRIV EN KOMMENTAR eller stil mig et spørgsmål om opskriften.

                "description": "Нема веће удобне хране од обилне чорбе. А ирска говедина и Гуиннесс паприкаш би могли бити краљ свих њих! Гуиннесс пиво даје сосу невероватно богат, дубок укус, а говедина је мекана на распад.\nИрски паприкаш је невероватан паприкаш. Већ знате да ће све што се кува сатима сигурно бити укусно. Али ово... ово је чорба о којој сте одувек сањали. То је онај који правим када имам госте и желим да их заиста импресионирам!\nКључни састојак који Гуиннесс чорби даје богат укус и дубоку боју је Гуиннесс пиво. И не брините, јело уопште нема укус пива! Претвара се у укусан сос који је апсолутно укусан. Осим тога, сав алкохол се скува, тако да нећете остати са укусом алкохола. Додавање сланине у гулаш је опционо, али свакако даје додатни укус. Зато само напред и препустите се ако желите. У сваком случају, чека вас заиста посебан гулаш. Пробајте ово укусно јело и коментаришите како вам се свиђа! Пријатан дан! 🥰😍🤗\n\nСАСТОЈЦИ:\n2 кашике маслиновог уља\n2 лб / 900 г говедине\nЗачините сољу и црним бибером\n2 чена белог лука\n2 лука\n6 оз / 170 г сланине\n2 шаргарепе\n2 стабљике целера\n3 кашике брашна\n14,9 оз / 440 мл Гуиннесс Беер\n3 кашике парадајз пасте\n3 шоље / 750 мл бујона\n2 ловорова листа\n1 кашичица тимијана\n\n\nУПУТСТВО:\n1. Почните са сечењем говедине на велике комаде, отприлике 4-5 цм.\n2. Загрејте уље у лонцу са дебелим дном (холандска пећница од ливеног гвожђа) на јакој ватри. Додајте говедину у серијама и добро је пропржите са свих страна. Поспите сољу и бибером преко говедине. Када порумени, пребаците говедину на тањир и поновите са преосталом говедином.\n3. Смањите температуру на средњу. Бели и црни лук кувајте око 2 минута док не почну да омекшају. Затим додајте сланину и наставите да кувате док сланина не порумени.\n4. Умешајте шаргарепу и целер, па кувајте још неколико минута.\n5. Додајте брашно у шерпу и мешајте 1 минут да се брашно скува.\n6. Сипајте Гинис, бујон и парадајз пасту. Добро промешајте да се брашно потпуно раствори. Додајте ловоров лист и тимијан.\n7. Вратите говедину и све накупљене сокове назад у шерпу. Ниво течности треба само да покрије састојке.\n8. Покријте шерпу и смањите ватру да лагано крчка. Оставите да се кува 2 сата док говедина не омекша. Затим уклоните поклопац и динстајте још 45 минута, или док се говедина лако не распадне, а сос се мало смањи и згусне.\nПослужите јунетину и Гинисов паприкаш уз тестенину, пире кромпир или шта год желите. Уживати!\n\n\nМоји пријатељи, ако вам се свидео овај видео, можете помоћи да проширите канал:\n\nОцените видео! 👍 - Бићу веома срећан и то ће помоћи развоју канала.\n\nНАПИШИТЕ КОМЕНТАР или ми поставите питање о рецепту.

                "description": "Nu există mâncare mai confortabilă decât o tocană consistentă. Și carnea de vită irlandeză și tocană Guinness ar putea fi regele tuturor! Berea Guinness oferă sosului o aromă incredibil de bogată și profundă, iar carnea de vită este fragedă.\nIrish Stew este o tocană uimitoare. Știți deja că orice lucru fiert ore în șir este neapărat delicios. Dar asta... asta e tocanita la care ai visat mereu. Este cea pe care o fac atunci când am oaspeți și vreau să îi impresionez cu adevărat!\nIngredientul cheie care dă tocană Guinness aroma sa bogată și culoarea profundă este berea Guinness. Și nu vă faceți griji, felul de mâncare nu are deloc gust de bere! Se transformă într-un sos savuros care este absolut delicios. În plus, tot alcoolul se gătește, așa că nu vei rămâne cu niciun gust de băutură. Adăugarea de slănină la tocană este opțională, dar cu siguranță adaugă un plus de aromă. Așa că mergeți mai departe și răsfățați-vă dacă doriți. Oricum, ești pregătit pentru o tocană cu adevărat specială. Încercați acest preparat delicios și comentați cum vă place! Sa aveti o zi delicioasa! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENTE:\n2 linguri ulei de măsline\n2 lb / 900 g carne de vită\nSe condimentează cu sare și piper negru\n2 catei de usturoi\n2 cepe\n6 oz / 170 g bacon\n2 morcovi\n2 tulpini de telina\n3 linguri faina\n14,9 oz / 440 ml bere Guinness\n3 linguri pasta de tomate\n3 căni / 750 ml bulion\n2 foi de dafin\n1 lingura de cimbru\n\n\nINSTRUCȚIUNI:\n1. Începeți prin a tăia carnea de vită în bucăți mari, de aproximativ 4-5 cm.\n2. Încinge uleiul într-o oală cu fund greu (cuptor olandez din fontă) la foc mare. Adăugați carnea de vită în loturi și rumeniți-o bine pe toate părțile. Presărați sare și piper peste carnea de vită. Odată rumenită, transferați carnea de vită pe o farfurie și repetați cu lotul rămas de carne de vită.\n3. Reduceți căldura la mediu. Gatiti usturoiul si ceapa aproximativ 2 minute pana incep sa se inmoaie. Apoi, adăugați slănina și continuați să gătiți până când slănina se rumenește.\n4. Adăugați morcovul și țelina și gătiți încă câteva minute.\n5. Adăugați făina în oală și amestecați timp de 1 minut pentru a găti făina.\n6. Turnați Guinness, bulionul și pasta de roșii. Amestecați bine pentru a vă asigura că făina se dizolvă complet. Adăugați foile de dafin și cimbru.\n7. Reintroduceți carnea de vită și toate sucurile acumulate înapoi în oală. Nivelul lichidului ar trebui să acopere doar ingredientele.\n8. Acoperiți oala și reduceți focul la o fierbere blândă. Se lasa sa fiarba 2 ore pana cand carnea de vita este frageda. Apoi, scoateți capacul și fierbeți încă 45 de minute sau până când carnea de vită se destramă ușor și sosul s-a redus și s-a îngroșat ușor.\nServiți carnea de vită și tocană Guinness cu paste, piure de cartofi sau orice doriți.

Guinness pivo daje sosu nevjerovatno bogat, dubok okus, a govedina je mekana.\nIrish Stew je jedan nevjerovatan gulaš. Već znate da će sve što se krčka satima sigurno biti ukusno. Ali ovo... ovo je gulaš o kojem ste oduvijek sanjali. To je onaj koji pravim kada imam goste i želim da ih zaista impresioniram!\nKljučni sastojak koji Guinness paprikašu daje bogat okus i duboku boju je Guinness pivo. I ne brinite, jelo uopšte nema ukus piva! Pretvara se u ukusan sos koji je apsolutno ukusan. Osim toga, sav alkohol se skuva, tako da nećete ostati s okusom alkohola. Dodavanje slanine u varivo je opciono, ali svakako daje dodatni ukus. Zato samo napred i prepustite se ako želite. U svakom slučaju, čeka vas zaista poseban gulaš.

Počnite sa sečenjem govedine na velike komade, otprilike 4-5 cm.\n2. Zagrijte ulje u loncu s debelim dnom (holandska pećnica od livenog gvožđa) na jakoj vatri. Dodajte govedinu u serijama i dobro je zapržite sa svih strana. Pospite solju i biberom preko junetine. Kada porumeni, prebacite govedinu na tanjir i ponovite sa preostalom porcijom govedine.\n3. Smanjite temperaturu na srednju. Beli i crni luk kuvajte oko 2 minuta dok ne počnu da omekšaju. Zatim dodajte slaninu i nastavite kuhati dok slanina ne porumeni.\n4. Umiješajte šargarepu i celer, pa kuhajte još nekoliko minuta.\n5. Dodajte brašno u šerpu i mešajte 1 minut da se brašno skuva.\n6. Ulijte Guinness, juhu i paradajz pastu. Dobro promiješajte da se brašno potpuno otopi. Dodajte lovorov list i timijan.\n7. Vratite govedinu i nakupljene sokove nazad u lonac. Nivo tečnosti treba samo da pokrije sastojke.\n8. Poklopite lonac i smanjite vatru na lagano krčkanje. Ostavite da se kuva 2 sata dok govedina ne omekša. Zatim skinite poklopac i dinstajte još 45 minuta, ili dok se govedina lako ne raspadne, a sos se malo smanji i zgusne.\nPoslužite govedinu i Guinness paprikaš sa testeninom, pire krompirom ili šta god želite.

La cerveza Guinness le da a la salsa un sabor increíblemente rico y profundo, y la carne queda tierna.\nEl estofado irlandés es un guiso increíble. Ya sabes que cualquier cosa cocinada a fuego lento durante horas seguramente quedará deliciosa. Pero este... este es el guiso que siempre has soñado. ¡Es el que hago cuando tengo invitados y quiero impresionarlos de verdad!\nEl ingrediente clave que le da al guiso Guinness su rico sabor y color profundo es la cerveza Guinness. Y no te preocupes, ¡el plato no sabe nada a cerveza! Se transforma en una salsa sabrosa que es absolutamente deliciosa. Además, todo el alcohol se evapora, por lo que no quedará ningún sabor a alcohol. Agregar tocino al guiso es opcional, pero definitivamente agrega sabor extra. Así que adelante, date un capricho si quieres. De cualquier manera, te espera un guiso verdaderamente especial. ¡Prueba este delicioso platillo y comenta cómo te gusta! ¡Que tengas un delicioso día! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENTES:\n2 cucharadas de aceite de oliva\n2 libras / 900 g de carne de res\nSazone con sal y pimienta negro\n2 dientes de ajo\n2 cebollas\n6 onzas / 170 g de tocino\n2 zanahorias\n2 tallos de apio\n3 cucharadas de harina\nCerveza Guinness de 14,9 onzas / 440 ml\n3 cucharadas de pasta de tomate\n3 tazas / 750 ml de caldo\n2 hojas de laurel\n1 cucharadita de tomillo\n\n\nINSTRUCCIONES:\n1.

Agregue la zanahoria y el apio y cocine por unos minutos más.\n5. Agregue la harina a la olla y revuelva durante 1 minuto para que se cocine la harina.\n6. Vierta la Guinness, el caldo y la pasta de tomate. Mezcla bien para asegurar que la harina se disuelva por completo. Agrega las hojas de laurel y el tomillo.\n7. Devuelva la carne y los jugos acumulados a la olla. El nivel del líquido debe cubrir apenas los ingredientes.\n8. Cubra la olla y baje el fuego a fuego lento.

                "title": "Több száz 5 csillagos értékelés!! Híres hagyományos ír marhapörkölt recept",
                "description": "Nincs kényelmesebb étel egy kiadós pörköltnél. És az ír marhahús és a Guinness Stew lehet a király mind közül! A Guinness sör hihetetlenül gazdag, mély ízt ad a szósznak, a marhahús pedig szétesően puha.\nAz Irish Stew egy csodálatos pörkölt. Már tudja, hogy bármi, amit órákig párolunk, biztosan finom lesz. De ez... ez az a pörkölt, amiről mindig is álmodott. Ezt akkor készítem, amikor vendégeim vannak, és igazán le akarom nyűgözni őket!\nA legfontosabb összetevő, amely a Guinness Stew gazdag ízét és mély színét adja, a Guinness Beer. És ne aggódj, az ételnek egyáltalán nem sör íze van! Ízletes szósz lesz belőle, ami teljesen ínycsiklandó. Ráadásul az összes alkohol kifakad, így nem marad büdös íze. A pörkölthöz szalonna hozzáadása nem kötelező, de mindenképpen extra ízt ad. Szóval hajrá, és kényeztesse magát, ha akarja. Akárhogy is, egy igazán különleges pörköltben lesz része. Próbáld ki ezt a finom ételt, és írd meg kommentben, hogy ízlik! Legyen finom napotok! 🥰😍🤗\n\nÖSSZETEVŐK:\n2 evőkanál olívaolaj\n2 font / 900 g marhahús\nSóval és fekete borssal ízesítjük\n2 gerezd fokhagyma\n2 hagyma\n6 oz / 170 g szalonna\n2 sárgarépa\n2 zellerszár\n3 evőkanál liszt\n14,9 uncia / 440 ml Guinness sör\n3 evőkanál paradicsompüré\n3 csésze / 750 ml húsleves\n2 babérlevél\n1 teáskanál kakukkfű\n\n\nUTASÍTÁS:\n1. Kezdje azzal, hogy a marhahúst nagy, körülbelül 4-5 cm-es darabokra vágja.\n2. Melegítsünk olajat egy vastag fenekű edényben (öntöttvas holland sütő) nagy lángon. Tegye hozzá a marhahúst adagonként, és süsse jól barnára minden oldalát. Sózzuk és borsozzuk a marhahúst. Ha megpirult, tegyük át a marhahúst egy tányérra, és ismételjük meg a maradék marhahússal.\n3. Csökkentse a hőt közepesre. Főzzük a fokhagymát és a hagymát körülbelül 2 percig, amíg el nem kezdenek puhulni. Ezután adjuk hozzá a bacont, és főzzük tovább, amíg a szalonna megpirul.\n4. Keverjük hozzá a sárgarépát és a zellert, és főzzük még néhány percig.\n5. Adjuk hozzá a lisztet az edényhez, és keverjük 1 percig, hogy a liszt kifőjön.\n6. Öntsük bele a Guinnesst, a húslevest és a paradicsompürét. Jól keverjük össze, hogy a liszt teljesen feloldódjon. Hozzáadjuk a babérlevelet és a kakukkfüvet.\n7. Tegye vissza a marhahúst és a felgyülemlett levet az edénybe. A folyadékszintnek éppen el kell fednie az összetevőket.\n8. Fedjük le az edényt, és mérsékeljük a hőt enyhe párolásra. Hagyja 2 órán át főni, amíg a marha megpuhul. Ezután vegyük le a fedőt, és pároljuk további 45 percig, vagy amíg a marhahús könnyen szétesik, és a szósz meg nem puhul és kissé besűrűsödik.\nA marhahúst és a Guinness-pörköltet tésztával, burgonyapürével vagy bármi mással tálaljuk. Élvezd!\n\n\nBarátaim, ha tetszett ez a videó, segíthetnek a csatorna bővítésében:\n\nÉrtékeld a videót! 👍 - Nagyon boldog leszek és ez segíti a csatorna fejlődését.\n\nÍRJ MEGJEGYZÉST, vagy kérdezzen a recepttel kapcsolatban.

                "title": "Stovky 5-hviezdičkových recenzií!! Slávny tradičný írsky recept na dusené hovädzie mäso",
                "description": "Niet väčšieho komfortného jedla ako výdatný guláš. A írske hovädzie mäso a Guinness Stew môžu byť kráľom všetkých! Pivo Guinness dodáva omáčke neuveriteľne bohatú, hlbokú chuť a hovädzie mäso je krehké.\nIrish Stew je úžasný guláš. Už viete, že všetko, čo sa celé hodiny varí, bude určite chutné. Ale toto... toto je guláš, o ktorom ste vždy snívali. Je to ten, ktorý robím, keď mám hostí a chcem na nich skutočne zapôsobiť!\nKľúčovou ingredienciou, ktorá dáva Guinness Stew jeho bohatú chuť a sýtu farbu, je Guinness Beer. A nebojte sa, jedlo vôbec nechutí ako pivo! Premení sa na pikantnú omáčku, ktorá je absolútne lákavá. Navyše sa všetok alkohol vyvarí, takže vám nezostane žiadna chlastačka. Pridanie slaniny do guláša je voliteľné, ale určite pridá extra chuť. Tak choďte do toho a doprajte si, ak chcete. Tak či onak, čaká vás skutočne špeciálny guláš. Vyskúšajte toto chutné jedlo a napíšte, ako sa vám páči! Prajem vám príjemný deň! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENCIE:\n2 lyžice olivového oleja\n2 lb / 900 g hovädzieho mäsa\nDochutíme soľou a čiernym korením\n2 strúčiky cesnaku\n2 cibule\n6 uncí / 170 g slaniny\n2 mrkvy\n2 stonky zeleru\n3 lyžice múky\n14,9 oz / 440 ml piva Guinness\n3 lyžice paradajkovej pasty\n3 šálky / 750 ml vývaru\n2 bobkové listy\n1 ČL tymianu\n\n\nINŠTRUKCIE:\n1. Začnite nakrájaním hovädzieho mäsa na veľké kusy, približne 4-5 cm.\n2. V hrnci s hrubým dnom (holandská liatinová rúra) zohrejte olej na vysokú teplotu. Po dávkach pridajte hovädzie mäso a zo všetkých strán ho dobre opečte. Hovädzie mäso posypte soľou a korením. Po zhnednutí preložte hovädzie mäso na tanier a zopakujte to so zvyšnou dávkou hovädzieho mäsa.\n3. Znížte teplotu na strednú. Cesnak a cibuľu varte asi 2 minúty, kým nezačnú mäknúť. Potom pridajte slaninu a pokračujte v varení, kým slanina nezhnedne.\n4. Vmiešame mrkvu a zeler a ešte pár minút povaríme.\n5. Do hrnca pridajte múku a miešajte 1 minútu, aby sa múka uvarila.\n6. Nalejte Guinness, vývar a paradajkovú pastu. Dobre premiešajte, aby sa múka úplne rozpustila. Pridajte bobkové listy a tymian.\n7. Hovädzie mäso a prípadnú nahromadenú šťavu vráťte späť do hrnca. Hladina tekutiny by mala iba pokrývať ingrediencie.\n8. Hrniec prikryte a znížte teplotu na mierny var. Nechajte variť 2 hodiny, kým hovädzie mäso nezmäkne. Potom odstráňte pokrievku a varte ďalších 45 minút, alebo kým sa hovädzie mäso ľahko nerozpadne a omáčka sa nezredukuje a nezhustne.\nPodávajte hovädzie mäso a Guinness guinness s cestovinami, zemiakovou kašou alebo čímkoľvek, čo máte radi. Užite si to!\n\n\nMoji priatelia, ak sa vám toto video páčilo, môžete pomôcť rozšíriť kanál:\n\nOhodnoťte video! 👍 - Budem veľmi rád a pomôže to rozvoju kanála.\n\nNAPÍŠTE KOMENTÁR alebo sa ma spýtajte na recept.

Guinness-Bier verleiht der Sauce einen unglaublich reichen, intensiven Geschmack und das Rindfleisch ist zart und zart.\nIrish Stew ist ein erstaunlicher Eintopf. Sie wissen bereits, dass alles, was stundenlang köchelt, mit Sicherheit köstlich sein wird. Aber das... das ist der Eintopf, von dem Sie schon immer geträumt haben. Das mache ich, wenn ich Gäste habe und sie wirklich beeindrucken möchte!\nDie Hauptzutat, die dem Guinness-Eintopf seinen reichen Geschmack und seine tiefe Farbe verleiht, ist Guinness-Bier. Und keine Sorge, das Gericht schmeckt überhaupt nicht nach Bier! Es entsteht eine herzhafte Soße, die einem das Wasser im Munde zusammenlaufen lässt. Außerdem kocht der gesamte Alkohol aus, sodass kein Alkoholgeschmack zurückbleibt. Das Hinzufügen von Speck zum Eintopf ist optional, verleiht dem Eintopf aber auf jeden Fall zusätzlichen Geschmack. Also machen Sie weiter und lassen Sie sich verwöhnen, wenn Sie möchten. In jedem Fall erwartet Sie ein wirklich besonderer Eintopf.

Den Knoblauch und die Zwiebel etwa 2 Minuten kochen, bis sie weich werden. Dann den Speck hinzufügen und weiterbraten, bis der Speck gebräunt ist.\n4. Karotte und Sellerie hinzufügen und noch ein paar Minuten kochen lassen.\n5. Geben Sie das Mehl in den Topf und rühren Sie es 1 Minute lang um, um das Mehl zu verkochen.\n6. Guinness, Brühe und Tomatenmark hinzufügen. Gut vermischen, um sicherzustellen, dass sich das Mehl vollständig auflöst. Lorbeerblätter und Thymian hinzufügen.\n7. Geben Sie das Rindfleisch und den angesammelten Saft zurück in den Topf. Der Flüssigkeitsstand sollte gerade die Zutaten bedecken.\n8. Decken Sie den Topf ab und reduzieren Sie die Hitze auf ein leichtes Köcheln. 2 Stunden kochen lassen, bis das Rindfleisch zart ist.

Już wiesz, że wszystko gotowane godzinami z pewnością będzie pyszne. Ale to... to jest gulasz, o jakim zawsze marzyłeś. To ten, który robię, kiedy przychodzą goście i chcę naprawdę im zaimponować!\nKluczowym składnikiem, który nadaje gulaszowi Guinness jego bogaty smak i głęboki kolor, jest piwo Guinness. I nie martwcie się, danie w ogóle nie smakuje jak piwo! Zamienia się w pikantny sos, który rozpływa się w ustach. Co więcej, cały alkohol się wygotuje, więc nie pozostanie Ci żaden alkoholowy posmak.

                "description": "Няма по-удобна храна от обилна яхния. А ирландското говеждо и яхнията на Гинес може да са кралят на всички! Бирата Гинес придава на соса невероятно богат, дълбок вкус, а говеждото е крехко на разпадане.\nIrish Stew е невероятна яхния. Вече знаете, че всичко, което къкри с часове, непременно ще бъде вкусно. Но това... това е яхнията, за която винаги сте мечтали. Това е, което правя, когато имам гости и искам наистина да ги впечатля!\nКлючовата съставка, която придава на Guinness Stew неговия наситен вкус и дълбок цвят, е бирата Guinness. И не се притеснявайте, ястието изобщо няма вкус на бира! Превръща се в пикантен сос, който е абсолютно апетитен. Освен това целият алкохол се изпарява, така че няма да останете с алкохолен вкус. Добавянето на бекон към яхнията не е задължително, но определено добавя допълнителен вкус. Така че давайте и се отдайте, ако искате. Така или иначе, очаква ви една наистина специална яхния. Опитайте това вкусно ястие и коментирайте как ви харесва!

Започнете с нарязване на говеждо месо на големи парчета, приблизително 4-5 см.\n2. Загрейте олио в тенджера с дебело дъно (чугунена холандска фурна) на висока температура. Добавете говеждото на порции и го запечете добре от всички страни. Поръсете сол и черен пипер върху говеждото. След като покафенее, прехвърлете говеждото върху чиния и повторете с останалата порция говеждо.\n3. Намалете топлината до средна. Гответе чесъна и лука за около 2 минути, докато започнат да омекват. След това добавете бекона и продължете да готвите, докато беконът покафенее.\n4. Разбъркайте моркова и целината и гответе още няколко минути.\n5. Добавете брашното в тенджерата и разбъркайте за 1 минута, за да сварите брашното.\n6. Налейте Гинес, бульона и доматеното пюре. Разбъркайте добре, за да сте сигурни, че брашното се разтвори напълно. Добавете дафиновите листа и мащерката.\n7. Върнете говеждото и всички натрупани сокове обратно в тенджерата. Нивото на течността трябва само да покрива съставките.\n8. Покрийте тенджерата и намалете котлона до леко кипене. Оставете да се готви 2 часа, докато телешкото омекне. След това махнете капака и оставете да къкри още 45 минути или докато говеждото лесно се разпадне и сосът се редуцира и леко се сгъсти.\nПоднесете яхнията от телешко и Гинес с макарони, картофено пюре или каквото обичате.

                "description": "Нет более вкусной еды, чем сытное рагу. И ирландская говядина и рагу «Гиннесс» могут стать королями из всех! Пиво Guinness придает соусу невероятно насыщенный и глубокий вкус, а говядина получается нежной.\nИрландское рагу – потрясающее рагу. Вы уже знаете, что все, что варится часами, обязательно будет вкусным. Но это... это тушеное мясо, о котором ты всегда мечтал. Его я готовлю, когда ко мне приходят гости и я хочу по-настоящему произвести на них впечатление!\nКлючевым ингредиентом, придающим Guinness Stew богатый вкус и глубокий цвет, является пиво Guinness. И не волнуйтесь, блюдо совершенно не похоже на пиво! Он превращается в пикантный соус, от которого текут слюнки. Кроме того, весь алкоголь выветривается, поэтому привкуса спиртного не останется. Добавлять бекон в рагу необязательно, но он определенно добавит дополнительный вкус. Так что давай, балуйся, если хочешь. В любом случае вас ждет действительно особенное рагу. Попробуйте это вкусное блюдо и напишите в комментариях, как оно вам! Вкусного дня! 🥰😍🤗\n\nИНГРЕДИЕНТЫ:\n2 столовые ложки оливкового масла\n2 фунта / 900 г говядины\nПриправить солью и черным перцем\n2 зубчика чеснока\n2 луковицы\n6 унций / 170 г бекона\n2 моркови\n2 стебля сельдерея\n3 столовые ложки муки\n440 мл пива Guinness\n3 столовые ложки томатной пасты\n3 стакана/750 мл бульона\n2 лавровых листа\n1 чайная ложка тимьяна\n\n\nИНСТРУКЦИИ:\n1. Для начала нарежьте говядину крупными кусками, примерно 4–5 см.\n2. Нагрейте масло в кастрюле с толстым дном (чугунная жаровня) на сильном огне. Порциями добавляйте говядину и хорошо подрумянивайте ее со всех сторон. Посыпьте говядину солью и перцем. Когда говядина подрумянится, переложите ее на тарелку и повторите то же самое с оставшейся партией говядины.\n3. Уменьшите огонь до среднего. Готовьте чеснок и лук около 2 минут, пока они не начнут размягчаться. Затем добавьте бекон и продолжайте готовить, пока бекон не подрумянится.\n4. Добавьте морковь и сельдерей и готовьте еще несколько минут.\n5. Добавьте в кастрюлю муку и перемешивайте 1 минуту, чтобы мука выпарилась.\n6. Влейте «Гиннесс», бульон и томатную пасту. Хорошо перемешайте, чтобы мука полностью растворилась. Добавьте лавровый лист и тимьян.\n7. Верните говядину и весь скопившийся сок обратно в кастрюлю. Уровень жидкости должен только покрывать ингредиенты.\n8. Накройте кастрюлю крышкой и убавьте огонь до слабого кипения. Оставьте вариться на 2 часа, пока говядина не станет мягкой. Затем снимите крышку и варите еще 45 минут, или пока говядина не начнет легко разваливаться, а соус не уварится и не загустеет.\nПодавайте говядину и рагу «Гиннесс» с макаронами, картофельным пюре или чем угодно.

                "description": "Δεν υπάρχει μεγαλύτερη άνεση από ένα χορταστικό στιφάδο. Και το Irish Beef και το Guinness Stew μπορεί να είναι ο βασιλιάς όλων! Η μπύρα Guinness δίνει στη σάλτσα μια απίστευτη πλούσια, βαθιά γεύση και το βοδινό κρέας είναι τρυφερό.\nΤο Irish Stew είναι ένα καταπληκτικό στιφάδο. Γνωρίζετε ήδη ότι οτιδήποτε σιγοβράσει για ώρες είναι αναπόφευκτο να είναι νόστιμο. Αλλά αυτό... αυτό είναι το στιφάδο που πάντα ονειρευόσασταν. Είναι αυτό που φτιάχνω όταν έχω καλεσμένους και θέλω πραγματικά να τους εντυπωσιάσω!\nΤο βασικό συστατικό που δίνει στο Guinness Stew την πλούσια γεύση και το βαθύ χρώμα του είναι η μπύρα Guinness. Και μην ανησυχείτε, το πιάτο δεν έχει καθόλου γεύση μπύρας! Μεταμορφώνεται σε μια αλμυρή σάλτσα που είναι απολύτως λαχταριστή. Επιπλέον, όλο το αλκοόλ μαγειρεύεται έξω, έτσι δεν θα μείνετε με καμία ποινή γεύση. Η προσθήκη μπέικον στο στιφάδο είναι προαιρετική, αλλά σίγουρα προσθέτει επιπλέον γεύση. Οπότε προχωρήστε και αφεθείτε αν θέλετε. Είτε έτσι είτε αλλιώς, είστε έτοιμοι για ένα πραγματικά ιδιαίτερο στιφάδο. Δοκιμάστε αυτό το νόστιμο πιάτο και σχολιάστε πώς σας αρέσει! Να έχετε μια υπέροχη μέρα! 🥰😍🤗\n\nΣΥΣΤΑΤΙΚΑ:\n2 κουταλιές της σούπας ελαιόλαδο\n2 λίβρες / 900 γρ μοσχαρίσιο κρέας\nΑλατοπιπερώνουμε με μαύρο πιπέρι\n2 σκελίδες σκόρδο\n2 κρεμμύδια\n6 oz / 170 g μπέικον\n2 καρότα\n2 κοτσάνια σέλινου\n3 κουταλιές της σούπας αλεύρι\n14,9 oz / 440 ml μπύρα Guinness\n3 κουταλιές της σούπας πελτέ ντομάτας\n3 φλιτζάνια / 750 ml ζωμό\n2 φύλλα δάφνης\n1 κγ θυμάρι\n\n\nΟΔΗΓΙΕΣ:\n1. Ξεκινήστε κόβοντας το βόειο κρέας σε μεγάλα κομμάτια, περίπου 4-5 εκ.\n2. Ζεσταίνουμε λάδι σε μια κατσαρόλα με βαρύ πάτο (χυτοσίδηρο ολλανδικό φούρνο) σε δυνατή φωτιά. Προσθέστε το μοσχάρι σε δόσεις και ροδίστε το καλά από όλες τις πλευρές. Πασπαλίζουμε με αλάτι και πιπέρι το μοσχάρι. Μόλις ροδίσει, μεταφέρετε το βόειο κρέας σε ένα πιάτο και επαναλάβετε με την υπόλοιπη παρτίδα του βοείου κρέατος.\n3. Χαμηλώνουμε τη φωτιά σε μέτρια. Βράζετε το σκόρδο και το κρεμμύδι για περίπου 2 λεπτά μέχρι να αρχίσουν να μαλακώνουν. Στη συνέχεια, προσθέστε το μπέικον και συνεχίστε το μαγείρεμα μέχρι να ροδίσει το μπέικον.\n4. Ρίξτε μέσα το καρότο και το σέλινο, και μαγειρέψτε για λίγα λεπτά ακόμα.\n5. Προσθέτουμε το αλεύρι στην κατσαρόλα και ανακατεύουμε για 1 λεπτό να ψηθεί από το αλεύρι.\n6. Ρίχνουμε μέσα την Γκίνες, το ζωμό και τον πελτέ ντομάτας. Ανακατεύουμε καλά για να διαλυθεί τελείως το αλεύρι. Προσθέστε τα φύλλα δάφνης και το θυμάρι.\n7. Επιστρέψτε το βόειο κρέας και τυχόν συσσωρευμένους χυμούς πίσω στην κατσαρόλα. Το επίπεδο του υγρού πρέπει απλώς να καλύπτει τα συστατικά.\n8. Σκεπάζετε την κατσαρόλα και χαμηλώνετε τη φωτιά σε ένα απαλό βράσιμο. Αφήστε το να ψηθεί για 2 ώρες μέχρι να μαλακώσει το κρέας. Στη συνέχεια, αφαιρέστε το καπάκι και σιγοβράστε για επιπλέον 45 λεπτά ή μέχρι το βόειο κρέας να διαλύεται εύκολα και η σάλτσα να μειωθεί και να πήξει ελαφρώς.\nΣερβίρετε το μοσχάρι και το στιφάδο Guinness με ζυμαρικά, πουρέ ή ότι άλλο σας αρέσει.

                "title": "Centinaia di recensioni a 5 stelle!! Famosa ricetta tradizionale dello stufato di manzo irlandese",
                "description": "Non c'è cibo di conforto più grande di un abbondante stufato. E lo stufato di manzo irlandese e Guinness potrebbe essere il re di tutti! La birra Guinness conferisce alla salsa un sapore incredibilmente ricco e profondo e la carne è tenerissima.\nLo stufato irlandese è uno stufato straordinario. Sai già che qualsiasi cosa cotta a fuoco lento per ore sarà sicuramente deliziosa. Ma questo... questo è lo stufato che hai sempre sognato. È quello che preparo quando ho ospiti a casa e voglio stupirli davvero!\nL'ingrediente chiave che conferisce allo stufato Guinness il suo sapore ricco e il colore intenso è la birra Guinness. E non preoccuparti, il piatto non sa per niente di birra! Si trasforma in una salsa saporita che fa assolutamente venire l'acquolina in bocca. Inoltre, tutto l'alcol evapora, quindi non rimarrai con alcun gusto alcolico. L'aggiunta di pancetta allo spezzatino è facoltativa, ma aggiunge sicuramente sapore in più. Quindi vai avanti e concediti se vuoi. In ogni caso, ti aspetta uno stufato davvero speciale. Prova questo delizioso piatto e commenta come ti piace! Buona giornata! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENTI:\n2 cucchiai di olio d'oliva\n2 libbre / 900 g di carne di manzo\nCondire con sale e pepe nero\n2 spicchi d'aglio\n2 cipolle\nPancetta da 6 once / 170 g\n2 carote\n2 gambi di sedano\n3 cucchiai di farina\nBirra Guinness da 440 ml\n3 cucchiai di concentrato di pomodoro\n3 tazze/750 ml di brodo\n2 foglie di alloro\n1 cucchiaino di timo\n\n\nISTRUZIONI:\n1. Inizia tagliando la carne in grossi pezzi, circa 4-5 cm.\n2. Scaldare l'olio in una pentola dal fondo spesso (forno olandese in ghisa) a fuoco alto. Aggiungete la carne in porzioni e fatela rosolare bene su tutti i lati. Cospargere sale e pepe sulla carne. Una volta rosolata, trasferire la carne su un piatto e ripetere l'operazione con la restante porzione di carne.\n3. Abbassa la fiamma a una temperatura media. Cuocere l'aglio e la cipolla per circa 2 minuti finché non iniziano ad ammorbidirsi. Aggiungete poi la pancetta e continuate la cottura finché la pancetta non sarà dorata.\n4. Aggiungere la carota e il sedano e cuocere ancora per qualche minuto.\n5. Aggiungi la farina nella pentola e mescola per 1 minuto per far evaporare la farina.\n6. Versare la Guinness, il brodo e il concentrato di pomodoro. Mescolare bene per garantire che la farina si sciolga completamente. Aggiungere le foglie di alloro e il timo.\n7. Rimetti la carne e gli eventuali succhi accumulati nella pentola. Il livello del liquido dovrebbe coprire appena gli ingredienti.\n8. Copri la pentola e abbassa la fiamma a fuoco lento. Lasciate cuocere per 2 ore finché la carne sarà tenera. Quindi, togliere il coperchio e cuocere a fuoco lento per altri 45 minuti, o fino a quando la carne si sfalda facilmente e la salsa si sarà ridotta e addensata leggermente.\nServite lo spezzatino di manzo e Guinness con pasta, purè di patate o quello che preferite.

Þú veist nú þegar að allt sem er kraumað í marga klukkutíma hlýtur að vera ljúffengt. En þetta... þetta er plokkfiskurinn sem þig hefur alltaf dreymt um. Það er það sem ég geri þegar ég er með gesti og vil virkilega heilla þá!\nLykilefnið sem gefur Guinness Stew sitt ríkulega bragð og djúpa lit er Guinness bjór. Og ekki hafa áhyggjur, rétturinn bragðast alls ekki eins og bjór! Það breytist í bragðmikla sósu sem er algjörlega ljúffeng. Auk þess er allt áfengið útbúið, svo þú situr ekki eftir með neinn bragðbragð. Að bæta beikoni við plokkfiskinn er valfrjálst, en það bætir örugglega auka bragð.

Byrjaðu á því að skera nautakjötið í stóra bita, um það bil 4-5 cm.\n2. Hitið olíu í þykkbotna potti (cast iron dutch oven) við háan hita. Bætið nautakjötinu saman við í skömmtum og brúnið það vel á öllum hliðum. Stráið salti og pipar yfir nautakjötið. Þegar nautakjötið hefur brúnast, flytjið það yfir á disk og endurtakið með afganginum af nautakjöti.\n3. Lækkið hitann í miðlungs. Steikið hvítlaukinn og laukinn í um það bil 2 mínútur þar til þeir byrja að mýkjast. Bætið síðan beikoninu út í og haltu áfram að elda þar til beikonið er brúnt.\n4. Hrærið gulrótinni og selleríinu saman við og eldið í nokkrar mínútur í viðbót.\n5. Bætið hveitinu í pottinn og hrærið í 1 mínútu til að elda hveitið af.\n6. Hellið Guinness, soði og tómatmauki út í. Blandið vel saman til að tryggja að hveitið leysist alveg upp. Bætið lárviðarlaufunum og timjaninu út í.\n7. Setjið nautakjötið og uppsafnaðan safa aftur í pottinn. Vökvamagnið ætti bara að ná yfir innihaldsefnin.\n8. Setjið lok á pottinn og lækkið hitann í vægan krauma. Látið malla í 2 tíma þar til nautakjötið er meyrt. Takið síðan lokið af og látið malla í 45 mínútur til viðbótar, eða þar til nautakjötið dettur auðveldlega í sundur og sósan hefur minnkað og þykknað aðeins.\nBerið nautakjötið og Guinness plokkfiskinn fram með pasta, kartöflumús eða hverju sem þið viljið.

Гинисовото пиво му дава на сосот неверојатно богат, длабок вкус, а говедското месо е нежно.\nИрската чорба е една неверојатна чорба. Веќе знаете дека сè што се крчка со часови сигурно ќе биде вкусно. Но, ова... ова е чорбата за која отсекогаш сте сонувале. Тоа е оној што го правам кога имам гости и сакам навистина да ги импресионувам!\nКлучната состојка која на Гинисовата чорба му дава богат вкус и длабока боја е Гинисовото пиво. И не грижете се, јадењето воопшто нема вкус на пиво! Се трансформира во солен сос кој е апсолутно воден за уста. Плус, целиот алкохол се свари, така што нема да останете со никаков бурен вкус. Додавањето сланина во чорбата е опционално, но дефинитивно додава дополнителен вкус. Затоа, повелете и препуштете се ако сакате. Во секој случај, ви претстои навистина посебна чорба.

Започнете со сечење на говедското месо на големи парчиња, приближно 4-5 см.\n2. Загрејте масло во тенџере со тешко дно (холандска печка од леано железо) на силен оган. Додадете го говедското месо во серии и добро зарумете го од сите страни. Говедското месо посипете го со сол и бибер. Откако ќе зарумени, префрлете го говедското месо на чинија и повторете го со преостанатата серија говедско месо.\n3. Намалете ја топлината на средно. Варете ги лукот и кромидот околу 2 минути додека не почнат да омекнуваат. Потоа, додадете ја сланината и продолжете со готвење додека сланината не порумени.\n4. Измешајте ги морковот и целерот и варете уште неколку минути.\n5. Додадете го брашното во тенџерето и мешајте 1 минута за да се свари брашното.\n6. Истурете ги Гинисовата супа и доматната паста. Добро измешајте за брашното целосно да се раствори. Додадете ги ловоровите листови и мајчина душица.\n7. Вратете го говедското месо и сите насобрани сокови назад во тенџерето. Нивото на течност треба само да ги покрие состојките.\n8. Покријте го тенџерето и намалете ја топлината на тивок оган. Оставете го да се готви 2 часа додека говедското месо не омекне. Потоа, извадете го капакот и вриејте дополнителни 45 минути или додека говедското месо лесно не се распадне и сосот не се намали и малку се згусне.\nГоведското месо и гинисовата чорба послужете ги со тестенини, пире од компири или што и да сакате.

Ja ärge muretsege, roog ei maitse üldse õlle järele! See muutub soolaseks kastmeks, mis on täiesti suussulav. Lisaks küpseb kogu alkohol välja, nii et te ei jäta märja maitset. Peekoni lisamine hautisele on vabatahtlik, kuid kindlasti lisab see lisamaitset. Nii et minge edasi ja nautige, kui soovite. Mõlemal juhul ootab teid tõeliselt eriline hautis. Proovige seda maitsvat rooga ja kommenteerige, kuidas see teile meeldib! Ilusat päeva jätku! 🥰😍🤗\n\nKOOSTISOSAD:\n2 spl Oliiviõli\n2 naela / 900 g veiseliha\nMaitsesta soola ja musta pipraga\n2 küüslauguküünt\n2 sibulat\n6 untsi / 170 g peekonit\n2 porgandit\n2 sellerivart\n3 spl jahu\n14,9 untsi / 440 ml Guinnessi õlut\n3 spl tomatipastat\n3 tassi / 750 ml puljongit\n2 loorberilehte\n1 tl tüümiani\n\n\nJUHISED:\n1. Alustuseks lõigake veiseliha suurteks, umbes 4-5 cm tükkideks.\n2. Kuumuta paksupõhjalises potis (malmist hollandi ahjus) kõrgel kuumusel õli. Lisage veiseliha partiidena ja pruunistage see igast küljest hästi. Puista veiselihale soola ja pipart. Kui veiseliha on pruunistunud, viige see taldrikule ja korrake ülejäänud veiselihaga.\n3. Alandage kuumust keskmisele tasemele. Küpseta küüslauku ja sibulat umbes 2 minutit, kuni need hakkavad pehmenema. Seejärel lisa peekon ja jätka küpsetamist, kuni peekon on pruunistunud.\n4. Sega juurde porgand ja seller ning küpseta veel paar minutit.\n5. Lisa potti jahu ja sega 1 minut, et jahu ära küpseks.\n6. Vala sisse Guinness, puljong ja tomatipasta. Segage hästi, et jahu oleks täielikult lahustunud. Lisa loorberilehed ja tüümian.\n7. Pange veiseliha ja kogunenud mahlad tagasi potti. Vedeliku tase peaks lihtsalt katma koostisained.\n8. Kata pott kaanega ja alanda kuumust vaiksel tulel. Lase 2 tundi küpseda, kuni veiseliha on pehme. Seejärel eemaldage kaas ja hautage veel 45 minutit või kuni veiseliha laguneb kergesti ja kaste on vähenenud ja veidi paksenenud.\nServeeri veiseliha ja Guinnessi hautist pasta, kartulipudru või muu meelepärasega. Nautige!\n\n\nMu sõbrad, kui teile see video meeldis, saate aidata kanalit kasvatada:\n\nHinda videot! 👍 - jään väga rahule ja see aitab kanali arengut kaasa.\n\nKIRJUTA KOMMENTAAR või esita mulle retsepti kohta küsimus.

                "description": "Няма больш камфортнай ежы, чым сытна рагу. А ірландская ялавічына і рагу Гінеса могуць быць каралём усіх! Піва Guinness надае соусу неверагодна насычаны, глыбокі густ, а ялавічына становіцца далікатнай.\nІрландскае рагу - гэта цудоўнае рагу. Вы ўжо ведаеце, што ўсё, што тушыцца гадзінамі, абавязкова будзе смачным. Але гэта... гэта рагу, пра якое вы заўсёды марылі. Гэта той, які я раблю, калі да мяне прыходзяць госці і хачу іх па-сапраўднаму ўразіць!\nКлючавым інгрэдыентам, які надае Guinness Raw насычаны густ і глыбокі колер, з'яўляецца піва Guinness. І не хвалюйцеся, смак стравы зусім не падобны на піва! Ён ператвараецца ў пікантны соус, які выклікае апетыт. Акрамя таго, увесь алкаголь выварваецца, так што ў вас не застанецца алкагольнага прысмаку. Даданне бекону ў рагу неабавязкова, але гэта, безумоўна, дадае дадатковы густ. Так што працягвайце і песціцеся, калі хочаце. У любым выпадку, вас чакае сапраўды асаблівае рагу. Паспрабуйце гэта смачнае страва і каментуйце, як яно вам падабаецца! Смачнага дня! 🥰😍🤗\n\nІНГРЭДЫЕНТЫ:\n2 ст.л аліўкавага алею\n2 фунта / 900 г ялавічыны\nЗаправіць соллю і чорным перцам\n2 зубчыка часныку\n2 цыбуліны\n6 унцый / 170 г бекону\n2 морквы\n2 сцябла салеры\n3 ст.л мукі\nПіва Guinness 14,9 унцый / 440 мл\n3 ст.л таматавай пасты\n3 шклянкі / 750 мл булёна\n2 лаўровых ліста\n1 ч. Л. чабора\n\n\nІНСТРУКЦЫІ:\n1. Пачніце з наразання ялавічыны на буйныя кавалкі, прыблізна 4-5 см.\n2. Разагрэйце алей у рондалі з тоўстым дном (чыгунная печ) на моцным агні. Дадайце ялавічыну порцыямі і добра падсмажце яе з усіх бакоў. Пасыпце ялавічыну соллю і перцам. Пасля таго, як падрумяніцца, перакладзеце ялавічыну на талерку і паўтарыце з пакінутай порцыяй ялавічыны.\n3. Зменшыце агонь да сярэдняга. Варыце часнык і лук каля 2 хвілін, пакуль яны не пачнуць размягчаться. Затым дадайце бекон і працягвайце рыхтаваць, пакуль бекон не падрумяніцца.\n4. Змяшайце моркву і салера і варыце яшчэ некалькі хвілін.\n5. Дадайце муку ў рондаль і памешвайце 1 хвіліну, каб зварыцца мука.\n6. Уліць Гінес, булён і таматавую пасту. Добра змяшайце, каб мука цалкам растварылася. Дадайце лаўровы ліст і чабор.\n7. Вярніце ялавічыну і ўвесь назапашаны сок назад у рондаль. Узровень вадкасці павінен толькі пакрываць інгрэдыенты.\n8. Накрыйце рондаль і зменшце агонь да слабога кіпення. Дайце варыцца 2 гадзіны, пакуль ялавічына не стане мяккай. Затым зніміце вечка і тушыце на павольным агні яшчэ 45 хвілін, або пакуль ялавічына лёгка не разваліцца, а соус трохі не паменшыцца і не згусне.\nПадавайце рагу з ялавічыны і Гінеса з макаронамі, бульбяным пюрэ або чым заўгодна. Атрымлівайце асалоду!\n\n\nМае сябры, калі вам спадабалася гэта відэа, вы можаце дапамагчы пашырыць канал:\n\nАцаніце відэа! 👍 - Буду вельмі рады і гэта дапаможа развіццю канала.\n\nНАПІШЫЦЕ КАМЕНТАР або задайце мне пытанне аб рэцэпце.

                "description": "Il n’y a pas de nourriture plus réconfortante qu’un ragoût copieux. Et le ragoût de bœuf irlandais et de Guinness pourrait être le roi de tous ! La bière Guinness donne à la sauce une saveur incroyablement riche et profonde, et le bœuf est tendre et en morceaux.\nLe ragoût irlandais est un ragoût incroyable. Vous savez déjà que tout ce qui mijote pendant des heures est forcément délicieux. Mais ça... c'est le ragoût dont tu as toujours rêvé. C'est celui que je prépare lorsque j'ai des invités et que je veux vraiment les impressionner !\nL’ingrédient clé qui donne au ragoût Guinness sa saveur riche et sa couleur profonde est la bière Guinness. Et ne vous inquiétez pas, le plat n’a pas du tout le goût de bière ! Il se transforme en une sauce savoureuse absolument alléchante. De plus, tout l'alcool disparaît, vous n'aurez donc aucun goût d'alcool. L'ajout de bacon au ragoût est facultatif, mais cela ajoute certainement une saveur supplémentaire. Alors n'hésitez pas et faites-vous plaisir si vous le souhaitez. Quoi qu’il en soit, vous allez déguster un ragoût vraiment spécial. Essayez ce délicieux plat et dites comment vous l'aimez ! Passez une délicieuse journée! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGRÉDIENTS:\n2 cuillères à soupe d'huile d'olive\n2 lb / 900 g de bœuf\nAssaisonner avec du sel et du poivre noir\n2 gousses d'ail\n2 oignons\n6 onces / 170 g de bacon\n2 carottes\n2 branches de céleri\n3 cuillères à soupe de farine\n14,9 onces / 440 ml de bière Guinness\n3 cuillères à soupe de concentré de tomate\n3 tasses / 750 ml de bouillon\n2 feuilles de laurier\n1 cuillère à café de thym\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. Commencez par couper le bœuf en gros morceaux d'environ 4 à 5 cm.\n2. Faites chauffer l’huile dans une marmite à fond épais (faitout en fonte) à feu vif. Ajoutez le bœuf par lots et faites-le bien dorer de tous les côtés. Saupoudrer de sel et de poivre sur le bœuf. Une fois doré, transférez le bœuf dans une assiette et répétez avec le reste du bœuf.\n3. Baissez le feu à moyen. Faites cuire l'ail et l'oignon pendant environ 2 minutes jusqu'à ce qu'ils commencent à ramollir. Ajoutez ensuite le bacon et poursuivez la cuisson jusqu'à ce que le bacon soit doré.\n4. Incorporez la carotte et le céleri et laissez cuire encore quelques minutes.\n5. Ajoutez la farine dans la casserole et remuez pendant 1 minute pour faire cuire la farine.\n6. Versez la Guinness, le bouillon et le concentré de tomates. Bien mélanger pour que la farine se dissolve complètement. Ajoutez les feuilles de laurier et le thym.\n7. Remettez le bœuf et les jus accumulés dans la marmite. Le niveau de liquide doit juste couvrir les ingrédients.\n8. Couvrez la casserole et baissez le feu pour laisser mijoter doucement. Laissez cuire 2 heures jusqu'à ce que le bœuf soit tendre. Ensuite, retirez le couvercle et laissez mijoter pendant 45 minutes supplémentaires, ou jusqu'à ce que le bœuf se désagrège facilement et que la sauce ait réduit et légèrement épaissi.\nServez le ragoût de bœuf et de Guinness avec des pâtes, de la purée de pommes de terre ou ce que vous préférez.

                "title": "Simtiem 5 zvaigžņu atsauksmju! Slavenā tradicionālā īru liellopu gaļas sautējuma recepte",
                "description": "Nav ērtāka ēdiena par sātīgu sautējumu. Un Īru liellopu gaļa un Ginesa sautējums varētu būt karalis no tiem visiem! Ginesa alus piešķir mērcei neticami bagātīgu, dziļu garšu, un liellopu gaļa ir sabrūkoša maiga.\nIrish Stew ir viens pārsteidzošs sautējums. Jūs jau zināt, ka viss, kas tiek vārīts vairākas stundas, noteikti būs garšīgs. Bet šis... tas ir sautējums, par kādu vienmēr esat sapņojis. Tas ir tas, ko es gatavoju, kad man ir ciemiņi un es vēlos viņus patiesi pārsteigt!\nGalvenā sastāvdaļa, kas piešķir Guinness Stew bagātīgo garšu un dziļu krāsu, ir Ginesa alus. Un neuztraucieties, ēdiens nemaz negaršo pēc alus! Tas pārvēršas sāļā mērcē, kas ir absolūti mutes dzirdinoša. Turklāt viss alkohols izvārās, tāpēc jums nepaliks nekāda dzēruma garša. Bekona pievienošana sautējumam nav obligāta, taču tas noteikti piešķir papildu garšu. Tāpēc dodieties uz priekšu un izbaudiet, ja vēlaties. Jebkurā gadījumā jūs gaida patiesi īpašs sautējums. Izmēģiniet šo gardo ēdienu un komentējiet, kā jums tas garšo! Lai garda diena! 🥰😍🤗\n\nSASTĀVDAĻAS:\n2 ēdamkarotes Olīveļļas\n2 mārciņas / 900 g liellopa gaļas\nGaršojiet ar sāli un melnajiem pipariem\n2 ķiploka daiviņas\n2 sīpoli\n6 unces / 170 g bekona\n2 burkāni\n2 selerijas kāti\n3 ēdamkarotes miltu\n14,9 unces / 440 ml Ginesa alus\n3 ēdamkarotes tomātu pastas\n3 tases / 750 ml buljona\n2 lauru lapas\n1 tējk timiāns\n\n\nINSTRUKCIJAS:\n1. Sāciet ar liellopa gaļas sagriešanu lielos gabalos, apmēram 4-5 cm.\n2. Sildiet eļļu katlā ar biezu dibenu (čuguna holandiešu krāsnī) uz lielas uguns. Pa daļām pievienojiet liellopu gaļu un labi apbrūniniet no visām pusēm. Liellopu gaļu apkaisa ar sāli un pipariem. Kad liellopu gaļa ir brūna, pārlieciet to uz šķīvja un atkārtojiet to ar atlikušo liellopu gaļas partiju.\n3. Samaziniet siltumu līdz vidējai temperatūrai. Pagatavojiet ķiplokus un sīpolus apmēram 2 minūtes, līdz tie sāk mīkstināt. Pēc tam pievienojiet bekonu un turpiniet gatavot, līdz bekons ir brūns.\n4. Iemaisa burkānu un seleriju un pagatavo vēl dažas minūtes.\n5. Katliņā pievieno miltus un maisa 1 minūti, lai milti izvārās.\n6. Ielejiet Ginesu, buljonu un tomātu pastu. Labi samaisiet, lai milti pilnībā izšķīst. Pievienojiet lauru lapas un timiānu.\n7. Ievietojiet liellopu gaļu un visas uzkrātās sulas atpakaļ katlā. Šķidruma līmenim vajadzētu tikai aptvert sastāvdaļas.\n8. Katlu nosedziet un samaziniet uguni līdz vārīšanās temperatūrai. Ļaujiet tai pagatavot 2 stundas, līdz liellopu gaļa ir mīksta. Pēc tam noņemiet vāku un vāriet uz lēnas uguns vēl 45 minūtes vai līdz liellopa gaļa viegli sadalās un mērce ir samazinājusies un nedaudz sabiezējusi.\nPasniedziet liellopa gaļu un Ginesa sautējumu ar makaroniem, kartupeļu biezeni vai ko vien vēlaties.

                "title": "Na stotine ocen s 5 zvezdicami!! Slavni recept za tradicionalno irsko govejo enolončnico",
                "description": "Ni boljše hrane kot krepka enolončnica. In irska govedina in Guinnessova enolončnica sta morda kralj vseh! Pivo Guinness daje omaki neverjetno bogat, globok okus, govedina pa je mehka, kot da razpade.\nIrska enolončnica je neverjetna enolončnica. Že veste, da je vse, kar se kuha več ur, zagotovo okusno. Ampak to... to je enolončnica, o kateri ste vedno sanjali. To je tisti, ki ga pripravim, ko imam goste in jih želim resnično navdušiti!\nKljučna sestavina, ki daje enolončnici Guinness bogat okus in globoko barvo, je pivo Guinness. In brez skrbi, jed sploh nima okusa po pivu! Pretvori se v slano omako, ki se naravnost nalije. Poleg tega se ves alkohol skuha, tako da vam ne bo ostal noben okus po pijači. Dodajanje slanine v enolončnico ni obvezno, vendar zagotovo doda dodaten okus. Torej, kar naprej in se prepustite, če želite. Kakor koli že, čaka vas zares posebna enolončnica. Poskusite to okusno jed in komentirajte, kako vam je všeč! Imejte okusen dan! 🥰😍🤗\n\nSESTAVINE:\n2 žlici olivnega olja\n2 lb / 900 g govejega mesa\nZačinite s soljo in črnim poprom\n2 stroka česna\n2 čebuli\n6 oz / 170 g slanine\n2 korenčka\n2 stebli zelene\n3 žlice moke\n14,9 oz / 440 ml piva Guinness\n3 žlice paradižnikove paste\n3 skodelice / 750 ml juhe\n2 lovorjeva lista\n1 žlička timijana\n\n\nNAVODILA:\n1. Začnite z rezanjem govejega mesa na velike kose, približno 4-5 cm.\n2. Segrejte olje v loncu z debelim dnom (peč iz litega železa) na visoki vročini. Dodajte govedino v serijah in jo dobro zapecite z vseh strani. Govedino potresemo s soljo in poprom. Ko porjavi, govedino prenesite na krožnik in ponovite s preostalo serijo govedine.\n3. Ogenj znižajte na srednje. Česen in čebulo pražimo približno 2 minuti, dokler se ne začneta mehčati. Nato dodajte slanino in nadaljujte s kuhanjem, dokler slanina ne porjavi.\n4. Vmešajte korenček in zeleno ter kuhajte še nekaj minut.\n5. V lonec dodajte moko in mešajte 1 minuto, da se moka skuha.\n6. Nalijte Guinness, juho in paradižnikovo pasto. Dobro premešajte, da zagotovite, da se moka popolnoma raztopi. Dodajte lovorjev list in timijan.\n7. Vrnite govedino in vse nabrane sokove nazaj v lonec. Nivo tekočine naj le pokriva sestavine.\n8. Lonec pokrijte in zmanjšajte ogenj, da počasi vre. Pustite kuhati 2 uri, dokler se govedina ne zmehča. Nato odstranite pokrov in dušite še dodatnih 45 minut oziroma dokler govedina zlahka ne razpade in se omaka nekoliko zreducira in zgosti.\nGovejo in Guinnessovo enolončnico postrezite s testeninami, pire krompirjem ali čim drugim. Uživajte!\n\n\nMoji prijatelji, če vam je bil ta video všeč, lahko pomagate pri rasti kanala:\n\nOcenite video! 👍 - Zelo bom vesel in to bo pripomoglo k razvoju kanala.\n\nNAPIŠITE KOMENTAR ali mi postavite vprašanje o receptu.

Anda pasti tahu bahwa apa pun yang direbus berjam-jam pasti enak. Tapi ini... ini sup yang selalu kamu impikan. Itu yang saya buat saat ada tamu yang datang dan ingin benar-benar membuat mereka terkesan!\nBahan utama yang memberi Guinness Stew rasa yang kaya dan warna yang dalam adalah Guinness Beer. Dan jangan khawatir, hidangannya sama sekali tidak terasa seperti bir! Ini berubah menjadi saus gurih yang benar-benar menggugah selera. Ditambah lagi, semua alkoholnya sudah matang, jadi Anda tidak akan merasakan rasa mabuk apa pun. Menambahkan bacon ke dalam rebusan adalah opsional, tapi pasti menambah rasa ekstra.

                "title": "Hundratals 5-stjärniga recensioner!! Berömda traditionella irländska nötköttsgryta recept",
                "description": "Det finns ingen större tröstmat än en rejäl gryta. Och Irish Beef and Guinness Stew kan vara kungen av dem alla! Guinness öl ger såsen en otroligt rik, djup smak och nötköttet är mört.\nIrish Stew är en fantastisk gryta. Du vet redan att allt som har puttrat i timmar kommer att vara gott. Men det här... det här är grytan du alltid har drömt om. Det är den jag gör när jag har gäster över och vill verkligen imponera på dem!\nDen viktigaste ingrediensen som ger Guinness Stew dess rika smak och djupa färg är Guinness Beer. Och oroa dig inte, rätten smakar inte alls öl! Det förvandlas till en välsmakande sås som är absolut aptitretande. Dessutom kokar all alkohol ut, så du kommer inte att sitta kvar med någon spritsmak. Att lägga till bacon i grytan är valfritt, men det ger definitivt extra smak. Så varsågod och njut av dig om du vill. Hur som helst, du är ute efter en riktigt speciell gryta. Prova denna läckra rätt och kommentera hur du gillar den! Ha en härlig dag! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIENSER:\n2 msk olivolja\n2lb / 900g nötkött\nKrydda med salt och svartpeppar\n2 vitlöksklyftor\n2 lökar\n6 oz / 170 g bacon\n2 morötter\n2 stjälkar selleri\n3 msk mjöl\n14,9 oz / 440 ml Guinness öl\n3 msk tomatpuré\n3 koppar / 750 ml buljong\n2 lagerblad\n1 tsk timjan\n\n\nINSTRUKTIONER:\n1. Börja med att skära nötköttet i stora bitar, ca 4-5 cm.\n2. Värm olja i en tjockbottnad gryta (gjutjärn holländsk ugn) på hög värme. Tillsätt nötköttet i omgångar och bryn det väl på alla sidor. Strö salt och peppar över köttet. När det är brynt, överför nötköttet till en tallrik och upprepa med den återstående satsen nötkött.\n3. Sänk värmen till medel. Koka vitlöken och löken i ca 2 minuter tills de börjar mjukna. Tillsätt sedan baconet och fortsätt tillaga tills baconet är brynt.\n4. Rör ner moroten och sellerin och koka ytterligare några minuter.\n5. Tillsätt mjölet i grytan och rör om i 1 minut för att koka bort mjölet.\n6. Häll i Guinness, buljong och tomatpuré. Blanda väl så att mjölet löser sig helt. Tillsätt lagerbladen och timjan.\n7. Häll tillbaka nötköttet och eventuell ackumulerad juice i grytan. Vätskenivån ska precis täcka ingredienserna.\n8. Täck grytan och sänk värmen till en svag sjud. Låt koka i 2 timmar tills köttet är mört. Ta sedan av locket och låt sjuda i ytterligare 45 minuter, eller tills köttet lätt faller isär och såsen har reducerats och tjocknat något.\nServera biff- och Guinnessgrytan med pasta, potatismos eller vad du vill.

                "description": "Er is geen beter comfortfood dan een stevige stoofpot. En Irish Beef en Guinness Stew zijn misschien wel de koning van allemaal! Guinness-bier geeft de saus een ongelooflijk rijke, diepe smaak en het rundvlees valt zacht uit elkaar.\nIrish Stew is een geweldige stoofpot. Je weet al dat alles wat urenlang wordt gestoofd heerlijk zal zijn. Maar dit... dit is de stoofpot waar je altijd van hebt gedroomd. Het is degene die ik maak als ik gasten op bezoek heb en echt indruk op ze wil maken!\nHet belangrijkste ingrediënt dat Guinness Stew zijn rijke smaak en diepe kleur geeft, is Guinness Bier. En maak je geen zorgen, het gerecht smaakt helemaal niet naar bier! Het verandert in een hartige saus die absoluut overheerlijk is. Bovendien kookt alle alcohol uit, zodat je geen dronken smaak achterlaat. Het toevoegen van spek aan de stoofpot is optioneel, maar het voegt zeker extra smaak toe. Dus ga je gang en geniet als je wilt. Hoe dan ook, je hebt zin in een echt bijzondere stoofpot. Probeer dit heerlijke gerecht en laat weten wat jij ervan vindt! Heb een heerlijke dag! 🥰😍🤗\n\nINGREDIËNTEN:\n2 eetlepels olijfolie\n2 pond / 900 g rundvlees\nBreng op smaak met zout en zwarte peper\n2 teentjes knoflook\n2 uien\n6 oz / 170 g spek\n2 wortels\n2 stengels bleekselderij\n3 eetlepels bloem\n14,9 oz / 440 ml Guinness-bier\n3 eetlepels tomatenpuree\n3 kopjes / 750 ml bouillon\n2 laurierblaadjes\n1 theelepel tijm\n\n\nINSTRUCTIES:\n1. Begin met het rundvlees in grote stukken te snijden, ongeveer 4-5 cm.\n2. Verhit olie in een pan met dikke bodem (gietijzeren Nederlandse oven) op hoog vuur. Voeg het rundvlees in gedeelten toe en bak het aan alle kanten goed bruin. Strooi zout en peper over het rundvlees. Eenmaal bruin, doe het vlees op een bord en herhaal met de resterende partij rundvlees.\n3. Zet het vuur laag. Kook de knoflook en ui ongeveer 2 minuten tot ze zacht beginnen te worden. Voeg vervolgens het spek toe en blijf koken tot het spek bruin is.\n4. Roer de wortel en de bleekselderij erdoor en kook nog een paar minuten.\n5. Voeg de bloem toe aan de pan en roer gedurende 1 minuut om de bloem te laten koken.\n6. Giet het Guinness, de bouillon en de tomatenpuree erbij. Meng goed om ervoor te zorgen dat de bloem volledig oplost. Voeg de laurierblaadjes en de tijm toe.\n7. Doe het vlees en eventuele opgehoopte sappen terug in de pan. Het vloeistofniveau moet de ingrediënten net bedekken.\n8. Dek de pan af en zet het vuur laag, zodat het zachtjes kookt. Laat het 2 uur koken tot het vlees gaar is. Verwijder vervolgens het deksel en laat nog eens 45 minuten sudderen, of totdat het vlees gemakkelijk uit elkaar valt en de saus iets is ingedikt en ingedikt.\nServeer de rundvlees- en Guinness-stoofpot met pasta, aardappelpuree of wat je maar wilt.

Start med å skjære kjøttet i store biter, ca. 4-5 cm.\n2. Varm olje i en tykkbunnet gryte (cast iron dutch oven) over høy varme. Tilsett biffet i omganger og brun det godt på alle sider.

Birra Guinness i jep salcës një shije të pabesueshme të pasur dhe të thellë, dhe viçi është i butë.\nZierja irlandeze është një zierje e mrekullueshme. Tashmë e dini se çdo gjë e zier për orë të tëra do të jetë e shijshme. Por kjo... kjo është ziera që keni ëndërruar gjithmonë. Është ai që bëj kur kam të ftuar dhe dua t'u bëj vërtet përshtypje!\nPërbërësi kryesor që i jep Guinness Stew aromën e pasur dhe ngjyrën e thellë është Birra Guinness. Dhe mos u shqetësoni, gjella nuk ka aspak shije si birra! Ajo shndërrohet në një salcë të shijshme që është absolutisht e shijshme. Plus, i gjithë alkooli zihet, kështu që nuk do të mbeteni me ndonjë shije të pijshme. Shtimi i proshutës në zierje është opsionale, por padyshim shton aromë shtesë.

Filloni duke e prerë viçin në copa të mëdha, përafërsisht 4-5 cm.\n2. Ngrohni vajin në një tenxhere me fund të rëndë (furrë holandeze prej gize) mbi nxehtësi të lartë. Shtoni mishin e viçit në tufa dhe skuqeni mirë nga të gjitha anët. Spërkatni kripë dhe piper mbi viçin. Pasi të skuqet, transferojeni mishin në një pjatë dhe përsëritni me pjesën e mbetur të viçit.\n3. Uleni zjarrin në mesatare. Ziejini hudhrat dhe qepën për rreth 2 minuta derisa të fillojnë të zbuten. Më pas, shtoni proshutën dhe vazhdoni zierjen derisa proshuta të marrë ngjyrë kafe.\n4. Hidhni karrotën dhe selinon dhe gatuajeni edhe për disa minuta.\n5. Shtoni miellin në tenxhere dhe përzieni për 1 minutë që të ziejë mielli.\n6. Hidhni Guinness, lëngun e mishit dhe pastën e domates. Përziejini mirë që mielli të tretet plotësisht. Shtoni gjethet e dafinës dhe trumzën.\n7. Kthejeni mishin e viçit dhe çdo lëng të grumbulluar përsëri në tenxhere. Niveli i lëngut duhet vetëm të mbulojë përbërësit.\n8. Mbuloni tenxheren dhe ulni zjarrin në një zierje të lehtë. Lëreni të gatuhet për 2 orë derisa viçi të zbutet. Më pas, hiqeni kapakun dhe ziejini për 45 minuta të tjera, ose derisa mishi i viçit të copëtohet lehtë dhe salca të jetë zvogëluar dhe trashur pak.\nShërbejeni viçin dhe zierjen e Guinness me makarona, pure patatesh ose çfarëdo që ju pëlqen.
