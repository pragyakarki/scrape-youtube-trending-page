So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 brand new LTx!\n02:01 Outside truck tour\n08:08 Inside camper tour\n22:05 the roof \n23:15 driving the Moki dugway\n26:39 Valley of the Gods campsite\n29:50 first time using invisacook! \n32:32 Nates big announcement! \n34:24 my solo adventure\n45:36 smoking dinner\n47:42 Final thoughts",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 brand new LTx!\n02:01 Outside truck tour\n08:08 Inside camper tour\n22:05 the roof \n23:15 driving the Moki dugway\n26:39 Valley of the Gods campsite\n29:50 first time using invisacook! \n32:32 Nates big announcement! \n34:24 my solo adventure\n45:36 smoking dinner\n47:42 Final thoughts"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nFriday at 4:00pm ET\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson",

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson"

Generation, der sein Leben damit verbracht hat, auf dem Bauernhof seiner Familie zu wachsen, zu arbeiten und zu lernen. Sein Witz und sein trockener Sinn für Humor sprechen Kinder und Erwachsene gleichermaßen an. Als Produkt der Millennial-Generation verbindet sich seine Wertschätzung für neue Technologien mit seiner altmodischen Arbeitsmoral und er verfügt über die einzigartige Fähigkeit, seine Botschaft auf eine Weise zu vermitteln, die sowohl bei langjährigen Landwirten als auch bei jenen Anklang findet, die keine Ahnung von Landwirtschaft haben. Angesichts des wachsenden Bewusstseins der Verbraucher darüber, woher ihre Lebensmittel kommen, hat Zach erkannt, dass eine unabhängige Stimme aus der Landwirtschaftsbranche erforderlich ist. Zach fördert aktiv die Landwirtschaft, indem er seine täglichen Erfahrungen in der Landwirtschaftswelt teilt und gleichzeitig Landwirt für Landwirt Bildung vermittelt, um einen gemeinsamen Dialog zwischen Landwirten und der Öffentlichkeit zu ermöglichen. \nFolgen Sie uns \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nBearbeitet von: Becky Johnson"

Getting running water to power a blower had been on my list for a while now and the weather had been wet enough to cause enough flow in the creek to try one. A significant part of the labour in doing an iron smelt comes from the operation of the air supply (unless natural draft is used). The current air supply method I use was a hand powered, centrifugal fan encased in a housing as seen in previous videos.\n\n I had a 2 ideas as to how to automate this with water power. The first method was to build a large, slow water wheel and run a rope belt around it linking it to the smaller, faster fan rotor to spin it. I tried this and it kept having issues due to the rope not spinning the blower effectively and also the fact that the water level changed and the wheel stopped moving. \n\nThe second idea was to use a small diameter water wheel directly connected to the fan rotor with a water spout dropping the flow onto the wheel at a height. This turned out to be the simplest and most effective of the methods with rotor speeds between 6 and 8 revolutions a second being attained. The then encased the fan inside the existing blower housing and tested the blower on a furnace build in front of it. The blower did indeed work though not as powerfully as a hand powered one.\n\nWith some adjustments, the blower may be improved so it becomes competitive with the hand powered method. The water powered method will go endlessly without human effort and does not wear out any rope as does the hand powered method. It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future. \n\n00:00-00:23 Wet season and Furnace\n00:23-01:26 Toy water wheel\n1:26-08:59 Design 1, Large wheel, belt drive and fan \n08:59-16:14 Design 2, Small wheel, direct drive fan\n16:14-18:44 Fire by friction\n18:44-19:48 Igniting furnace, last minute adjustments\n19:48-22:33 Testing water powered forge blower\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #water  #forge #fire",

I tried this and it kept having issues due to the rope not spinning the blower effectively and also the fact that the water level changed and the wheel stopped moving. \n\nThe second idea was to use a small diameter water wheel directly connected to the fan rotor with a water spout dropping the flow onto the wheel at a height. This turned out to be the simplest and most effective of the methods with rotor speeds between 6 and 8 revolutions a second being attained. The then encased the fan inside the existing blower housing and tested the blower on a furnace build in front of it. The blower did indeed work though not as powerfully as a hand powered one.\n\nWith some adjustments, the blower may be improved so it becomes competitive with the hand powered method. The water powered method will go endlessly without human effort and does not wear out any rope as does the hand powered method. It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future. \n\n00:00-00:23 Wet season and Furnace\n00:23-01:26 Toy water wheel\n1:26-08:59 Design 1, Large wheel, belt drive and fan \n08:59-16:14 Design 2, Small wheel, direct drive fan\n16:14-18:44 Fire by friction\n18:44-19:48 Igniting furnace, last minute adjustments\n19:48-22:33 Testing water powered forge blower\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #water  #forge #fire"

            "description": "Sunday afternoon, as Jackie and Shadow shouted away an unseen intruder, the first ‘pip’ was confirmed on one of the eggs! (egg on the right)– A pip, or slight crack in the egg shell, is the first sign that the chick is working to hatch out.\n\nBy Monday morning, a pip was visible on the 2nd egg! –\nJackie and Shadow’s delayed incubation worked to make the chicks hatch closer together and be close to the same size.\n\nJackie was obviously feeling the movement underneath her as she kept looking down and standing up to roll the eggs much more than usual. Shadow happily got a turn on the eggs to give Jackie a morning break.\n\nBy mid-morning, the chick’s beak was visible and tiny chirps could be heard…\n\nWhen Shadow came to check in, Jackie stood and seemed to be telling him about the development…one chick could be seen moving inside. Jackie wouldn’t let Shadow have his turn. She was too invested to leave.\n\nIt took Shadow 4 more visits—2 sticks and 1 fluff—before Jackie let him take over for a short time. Now, both holes were bigger…and his turn came with lots of the soft talking instructions from Mama Jackie before she left.\n\nJackie soon returned with a fish that got left on the side of the nest, ready for feeding.\n\nBy afternoon, Jackie increased her soft talking to almost continuous, seeming to be encouraging her chicks to keep up the great progress. Both holes were growing and now big enough to easily see a moving beak inside each one.\n\nAs evening came, the holes grew more, tiny cheeps could be heard, and Shadow figured out he was unlikely to get another turn. He flew off to roost nearby.\n\n…but boy will he be surprised in the morning!…before midnight, the first chick had its wing and head visible and a short time later, it was out! Jackie pushed it back in a bit as she rolled the eggs, but it’s first touch down will be the official hatch time: 23:26, cam time.\n\nThe 2nd egg is moving forward quickly on its hatching process.\n\nAnd the 3rd egg is still only on Day 34. Normal hatchings are 35-42 days, so still plenty of time to wait and watch what happens with it.\nWelcome to the world, Chick#1!\nSandy\n\n\nFriends of Big Bear Valley (FOBBV) https://friendsofbigbearvalley.org/\nPublic Facebook Page (no account needed): https://www.facebook.com/FOBBV/\nPrivate Facebook Group (more content): https://www.facebook.com/groups/fobbv",

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive?\n\nWelcome to THE LONG DARK, the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls \"the pinnacle of an entire genre\".\n\nTHE LONG DARK is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster.\n\nTHE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION brings you the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates. Widely considered the paramount Survival game of all time, SURVIVAL EDITION gives you pure focus on THE LONG DARK’s Survival Sandbox -- the experience that started it all!\n\nIn THE LONG DARK, you are getting both the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates, and the award-winning episodic narrative mode, WINTERMUTE.\n\nIncluded with both THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION and THE LONG DARK, Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative Survival Sandbox that has defined the genre since launching on Steam in 2014. After years of open development and dozens of major updates, THE LONG DARK now stands at the pinnacle of the entire genre. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game.\n\nThe game that defined death for the survival genre. When you die in Survival, your save is deleted. Every decision matters.\n\nThe game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive.\n\nMonitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully.\n\nOver 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more.\n\nExplore a 50+ square kilometer Northern Canadian wilderness spanning 12 major regions and all the zones that connect them in search of life-saving supplies. Distant mountains, coastal towns, mines, farmlands, and a huge expanse of brutal winter wilderness to test your survival mettle.\n\nHunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates.\n\nFour distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes.\n\nFeatures the music of Sascha Dikiciyan.\n\nSeveral standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each.",

            "description": "Ashley Pointer | February 28, 2025\nThe morning that Bishop Marvin Sapp came to NPR, he told me that it was his kids who really emphasized how important it was for him to accept our invitation to perform: \"They told me, 'Dad, Tiny Desk is for the culture.' \"\n\nBacked by a four-piece band and a six-piece choir, Sapp transforms our office into a sanctuary, performing an 11-song medley of praise and worship hits that span more than three decades in music and ministry. From the moment his set begins, the spirit moves through the room, filling every corner with raw emotion, joy and reverence.\n\nFrom Sapp's early days with the trailblazing '90s gospel group Commissioned to penning anthems like \"Never Would Have Made It\" — a song that transcends church walls — his impact is woven into the fabric of Black culture. \"What's funny is, I saw some of y'all singing these songs, and y'all weren't even born when I recorded them,\" Sapp jokes, underscoring his intergenerational influence. Yet, despite his legendary status, Sapp took time after the performance to speak and pray with members of our audience, choosing ministry first, above all else.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I Believe\"\n\"Not the Time, Not the Place\"\n\"Grace and Mercy\"\n\"Perfect Peace\"\n\"Shout Unto God\"\n\"Here I Am\"\n\"Praise Him in Advance\"\n\"You Are God Alone\"\n\"He Has His Hands on You\"\n\"My Testimony\"\n\"The Best in Me\"\n\"Never Would Have Made It\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBishop Marvin Sapp: vocals\nCurtis Lindsey: keys, music director\nThaddeus Johnson: bass\nTavarius \"Varo\" Johnson: drums\nSam Mitchem: guitar\nChristina Michelle: background vocals\nGus Lacy: background vocals\nShaki Wilson: background vocals\nJarmone: background vocals\nA.

                "description": "Ashley Pointer | February 28, 2025\nThe morning that Bishop Marvin Sapp came to NPR, he told me that it was his kids who really emphasized how important it was for him to accept our invitation to perform: \"They told me, 'Dad, Tiny Desk is for the culture.' \"\n\nBacked by a four-piece band and a six-piece choir, Sapp transforms our office into a sanctuary, performing an 11-song medley of praise and worship hits that span more than three decades in music and ministry. From the moment his set begins, the spirit moves through the room, filling every corner with raw emotion, joy and reverence.\n\nFrom Sapp's early days with the trailblazing '90s gospel group Commissioned to penning anthems like \"Never Would Have Made It\" — a song that transcends church walls — his impact is woven into the fabric of Black culture. \"What's funny is, I saw some of y'all singing these songs, and y'all weren't even born when I recorded them,\" Sapp jokes, underscoring his intergenerational influence. Yet, despite his legendary status, Sapp took time after the performance to speak and pray with members of our audience, choosing ministry first, above all else.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I Believe\"\n\"Not the Time, Not the Place\"\n\"Grace and Mercy\"\n\"Perfect Peace\"\n\"Shout Unto God\"\n\"Here I Am\"\n\"Praise Him in Advance\"\n\"You Are God Alone\"\n\"He Has His Hands on You\"\n\"My Testimony\"\n\"The Best in Me\"\n\"Never Would Have Made It\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBishop Marvin Sapp: vocals\nCurtis Lindsey: keys, music director\nThaddeus Johnson: bass\nTavarius \"Varo\" Johnson: drums\nSam Mitchem: guitar\nChristina Michelle: background vocals\nGus Lacy: background vocals\nShaki Wilson: background vocals\nJarmone: background vocals\nA.
