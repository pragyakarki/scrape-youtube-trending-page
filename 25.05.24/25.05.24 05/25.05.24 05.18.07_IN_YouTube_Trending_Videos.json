His statue can still be seen in the palace of Raja Krishnachandra. Stories about his exploits are narrated in Bengal to this day and are immortalized in countless short stories.

                "description": "The War 2 teaser suggests a high-octane action movie with Hrithik Roshan's Kabir being challenged by Jr. NTR, featuring numerous action sequences and a global scale. However, the review notes excessive green screen usage, noticeable CGI, and the absence of a standout \"money shot,\" leading to disappointment compared to expectations set by previous Spy Universe films and Brahmastra. #War2 #PJExplained #thePJ\n\nMy Social Media Handles: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pjexplained/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pjexplained/\nSnapChat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/pjexplained\n\nReporter Roommate: https://www.youtube.com/@ReporterRoommate\nthePJ: https://www.youtube.com/@thepjoffical\n\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@pjexplained \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pjexplained/\nWhatsApp: https://shorturl.at/vQxpU\n\nThe PJ Explained is a web channel intended to promote cinema through films review, interviews, discussions, video essays and analytical compilations.
