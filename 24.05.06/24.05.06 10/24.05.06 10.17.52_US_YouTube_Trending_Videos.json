            "description": "Pound-for-pound great Canelo Álvarez turned in a vintage performance by dropping the previously unbeaten Jaime Munguia Saturday night on his way to earning a unanimous decision as Canelo Promotions presented the all-Mexican clash headlining a PBC Pay-Per-View event on Prime Video from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nMaking the fourth defense of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO 168-pound world titles, Canelo delivered another Cinco de Mayo weekend masterpiece as he took home the decision by scores of 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112. Munguia fought valiantly and was extremely busy in the ring, but Canelo consistently landed the cleaner shots across the 12 rounds.\n \n“This win means a lot,” said Canelo. “I’m glad that I gave him this opportunity. Munguia is a great guy and a great champion. He’s gonna have a great career. I’m very proud that the whole world is watching us Mexicans.”\n \n\"I came out strong and was winning the early rounds,” said Munguia. “I let my hands go, but he’s a fighter with a lot of experience. The loss hurts because it's my first loss and I felt strong.”\n \nMunguia appeared to have the momentum after he closed round three with a right hand that appeared to snap Canelo’s head back. However, Canelo responded like the future Hall of Famer he is and delivered the highlight of the fight in round four with a left hook-uppercut that put Munguia on the mat.\n \n“I took my time,” said Canelo. “I have a lot of experience. Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong and smart. But I have 12 rounds to win the fight and I did. I did really good and I’m proud of it. He’s strong, but he’s a little slow. I could see every punch. That’s why I’m the best.”\n \n\"There’s no doubt I would have beaten anyone else tonight,” said Munguia. “He has a lot of experience. I started well, but he’s a fighter who creates a lot of problems.\"\n \nCanelo rode the momentum from that moment to dominate the final eight rounds on the way to his unanimous decision. While Munguia threw more punches than Canelo according to CompuBox (663-536), it was Canelo who held the edge in shots landed (234-170) and connect rate (44% to 26%).\n \nAfter sweeping the final three rounds on all of the cards, Canelo discussed his place in boxing history and his plans for what comes next.\n \n“When I retire, my numbers will say what position I'm in,” said Canelo. “I know there's a lot of great Mexican fighters in the past, but I’m the best fighting right now. I’m gonna rest and enjoy my family. If the money is right, I can fight right now. I’ve fought everyone and I can do what I want.\"\n\n#CaneloMunguia #Canelo #JaimeMunguia \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

Its unique plethora of flora and fauna, all connected via the food web, and lead to some amazing insights into the workings of Mother Nature! But the time has come to create a second ecosystem vivarium, an attachment to Pantdora, as an extension to the biological world we created. In this episode, I travel to the biodiverse island of Borneo and Australia to explore different biomes, and decide on what animals, plants, and fungi, I might be able to house in our next world.

Remember my secret gaming room to hide from my mom, my sister, and my dad? Well, I've leveled up since then. I've become so good at building hidden gaming rooms that I decided to create one with a twist—a hidden doomsday bunker in the wild! To really test my skills, I threw in a new challenge: I have a bounty hunter on my trail, trying to find me in my new hidden bunker. It's the ultimate game: to prove how well I can blend in and stay undetected. Building this public doomsday bunker was insane, intense, and absolutely incredible. It took all my team’s wit, creativity, and a bit of stealth gaming magic. I've had a blast putting this together and can't wait for you to see how it all went down. From dodging curious onlookers to setting up the perfect  setup in my hidden bunker, it's been an adventure like no other.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a hidden doomsday bunker!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Backyard Underground Bunker Tour/Update 5 years on, But Hidden Bed Entrance to EPIC Bunker, But We Explored the World’s Largest Doomsday Community (575 underground bunkers), But I Built a SECRET Survival Bunker, But Texan maker's underground survival bunkers are real batcaves, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But Surviving inside Tiny vs GIANT Underground Bunkers, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But $1 vs $1,000,000 Secret Gaming Base, But I Survived 50 Hours In A Nuclear Bunker, But Surviving Overnight in $60 Million Doomsday Bunker, But DIY Container Bunker Construction: Pro Tips from @AtlasSurvivalShelters, But I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But Uncovering my Underground Bunker after an ENTIRE Year, But I Spent 24 Hours In A Doomsday Bunker, But I Survived a Nuke, or any other video like AllWeDoIsFun, Unspeakable, Airrack, JStu, colinfurze, Ben Azelart, The Container Guy, MrBeast, Dangie Bros, Kirsten Dirksen, Kara and Nate, Chris & Emily, FrenchieFries, or Faze Rug would make.

                "description": "Check out Dude Perfect's Toys! https://www.shopdudeperfect.com/?utm_source=Creator_Midroll_DP&utm_medium=Sterling1test\nI built a hidden doomsday bunker!\nSUBSCRIBE to @BeemGaming  a chance at a PS5! \nSUBSCRIBE to @MatthewBeem for a chance at $1,000! ➔ https://www.youtube.com/c/Mbeem10?sub_confirmation=1\nBeem Team Merch! ➔ https://beemteamshop.com/\n\nThanks you to @samsonjc22 for helping with this video!\n\n📱 FOLLOW MY SOCIALS 📱\n➽ Instagram - @MatthewBeem\n➽ Twitter - @MatthewBeem\n➽ TikTok - @MatthewBeem\n\nI'm back with another wild adventure, and this time, I've taken my passion for secret hideouts to a whole new level! Remember my secret gaming room to hide from my mom, my sister, and my dad? Well, I've leveled up since then. I've become so good at building hidden gaming rooms that I decided to create one with a twist—a hidden doomsday bunker in the wild! To really test my skills, I threw in a new challenge: I have a bounty hunter on my trail, trying to find me in my new hidden bunker. It's the ultimate game: to prove how well I can blend in and stay undetected. Building this public doomsday bunker was insane, intense, and absolutely incredible. It took all my team’s wit, creativity, and a bit of stealth gaming magic. I've had a blast putting this together and can't wait for you to see how it all went down. From dodging curious onlookers to setting up the perfect  setup in my hidden bunker, it's been an adventure like no other.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a hidden doomsday bunker!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot Backyard Underground Bunker Tour/Update 5 years on, But Hidden Bed Entrance to EPIC Bunker, But We Explored the World’s Largest Doomsday Community (575 underground bunkers), But I Built a SECRET Survival Bunker, But Texan maker's underground survival bunkers are real batcaves, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But Surviving inside Tiny vs GIANT Underground Bunkers, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But $1 vs $1,000,000 Secret Gaming Base, But I Survived 50 Hours In A Nuclear Bunker, But Surviving Overnight in $60 Million Doomsday Bunker, But DIY Container Bunker Construction: Pro Tips from @AtlasSurvivalShelters, But I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But Uncovering my Underground Bunker after an ENTIRE Year, But I Spent 24 Hours In A Doomsday Bunker, But I Survived a Nuke, or any other video like AllWeDoIsFun, Unspeakable, Airrack, JStu, colinfurze, Ben Azelart, The Container Guy, MrBeast, Dangie Bros, Kirsten Dirksen, Kara and Nate, Chris & Emily, FrenchieFries, or Faze Rug would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) builds a secret hidden doomsday bunker!"

ALIVE!?! After the Sonic vs Knuckles battle – and once both kaiju versions of Sonic and Knuckles fell – our heroes saw that the Blue Blur had somehow separated from the kaiju. But, this doesn't appear to be some super Sonic prime version of the saviour of Green Hill Zone. He's been through a lot.\n\nSo, here we are. At the end of There's Something About Knuckles. We hope you've enjoyed this series, because we had a hell of a time making it. But to say much more in this description would be giving away things, so we'll stop there.

                "description": "Pick up some BRAND NEW There's Something About Knuckles merch today! https://shopmashed.teemill.com/ \n\nAmy Rose, Tails, Cream and Blaze can't believe their eyes: Sonic the Hedgehog is... ALIVE!?! After the Sonic vs Knuckles battle – and once both kaiju versions of Sonic and Knuckles fell – our heroes saw that the Blue Blur had somehow separated from the kaiju. But, this doesn't appear to be some super Sonic prime version of the saviour of Green Hill Zone. He's been through a lot.\n\nSo, here we are. At the end of There's Something About Knuckles. We hope you've enjoyed this series, because we had a hell of a time making it. But to say much more in this description would be giving away things, so we'll stop there.

It may however be a type of geopolymer cement, where the cement is activated by and acid or a base (in this case a base). The acronym NASH is used to remember the material needed: sodium, alumina, silica and H2O. All of these are present in the materials used here.\n I did some experiments to see how to produce the cement using ash and fired clay from broken bricks. The first method was to take ash from a cold fire and form it into pellets. One pellet was left aside to dry while the others were calcined by firing them in a forge with wood. The calcined pellets were then mixed with terracotta in different proportions (ash: clay 1:0, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3). All samples survived a water test after setting for a week except for the sample made from cold ash that had not been calcined. This demonstrates the need to calcine the ash at a high temperature before use.\nNext I built a furnace with a grate for calcining ash to prove it could be done with natural draft rather than the more laborious blower method. An ash brick or clinker was made from a cold fire and was placed on the grate and fired. The clinker was then taken out, mixed with terracotta and formed into various shapes. One sample was mixed with sand as an alternative to terracotta. The samples all survived the water test after 2 days of setting though the sand sample isn't as strong as the terracotta ones.\nFinally, I took the ash from the furnace and used it as is without forming it into a clinker and calcining it. My theory was that ash from the furnace gets hot enough just from burning on the grate that it does not need further calcining. The ash was mixed as is with terracotta and left to set for only 6 hours. It passed the water test without dissolving suggesting a quick setting time.\nThese experiments have shown how it might be possible to scale up and simplify the production of ash cement. I'm considering it as an alternative to brick making as it's potentially a simpler method (no brick forming, hours stoking the kiln etc.). The structures would have to be adapted to the new material and might be insitu formed walls. More experiments need to be done.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #GeopolymerCement #cement"

            "title": "WILLOW: Tiny Desk Concert",
            "description": "Ashley Pointer | May 1, 2024\nOn a call ahead of her Tiny Desk taping, WILLOW told me that she \"just wants to feel it and be in the vibe.\" Many artists worry about having to tailor their music for the space, but if done right, a beautiful synergy can be achieved. With boundless energy and magnetic stage presence, the artist's exceptional vocal range and musicality left the audience spellbound.\n\nDespite being only 23 years old, the singer-songwriter and musician Willow Smith is a vet when it comes to this music thing. She's been consistently making music and on a journey of sonic exploration since she was just 9 years old and is about to put out her sixth album, empathogen, in just a few days. Zach Tenorio on upright piano kicks off the show, cueing the first few bars of the jazz-infused, odd-meter vibes of \"Symptom of Life\" from the new album, later complimented by trippy Ebow effects courtesy of Liso Lee on guitar.\n\nThen, a couple throwbacks: a stripped down arrangement of \"Split\" from the 2022 album and fan-favorite \"Wait a Minute!\" from her 2015 album ARDIPITHECUS, which undergoes some mind-blowing bass riffing from Mohini Dey. Dey continues with some severe stank-face on a world premiere of the funky, bass-heavy \"Run!\" from the upcoming album, locking in tastefully with The Pocket Queen on drums. Closing the set with \"Big Feelings,\" the band gets busy while WILLOW's vocals soar, effortlessly teetering between emotive highs and lows, leaving us all wanting more.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Symptom of Life\"\n\"Split\"\n\"Wait a Minute!\"\n\"Run!\"\n\"Big Feelings\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nWillow Smith: vocals   \nLiso Lee: guitar, vocals       \nZach Tenorio: keys         \nMohini Dey: bass            \nTaylor \"The Pocket Queen\" Gordon: drums      \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Ashley Pointer, Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josephine Nyounai\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Elle Mannion\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills \nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#willow #tinydesk #nprmusic",

                "title": "WILLOW: Tiny Desk Concert",
                "description": "Ashley Pointer | May 1, 2024\nOn a call ahead of her Tiny Desk taping, WILLOW told me that she \"just wants to feel it and be in the vibe.\" Many artists worry about having to tailor their music for the space, but if done right, a beautiful synergy can be achieved. With boundless energy and magnetic stage presence, the artist's exceptional vocal range and musicality left the audience spellbound.\n\nDespite being only 23 years old, the singer-songwriter and musician Willow Smith is a vet when it comes to this music thing. She's been consistently making music and on a journey of sonic exploration since she was just 9 years old and is about to put out her sixth album, empathogen, in just a few days. Zach Tenorio on upright piano kicks off the show, cueing the first few bars of the jazz-infused, odd-meter vibes of \"Symptom of Life\" from the new album, later complimented by trippy Ebow effects courtesy of Liso Lee on guitar.\n\nThen, a couple throwbacks: a stripped down arrangement of \"Split\" from the 2022 album and fan-favorite \"Wait a Minute!\" from her 2015 album ARDIPITHECUS, which undergoes some mind-blowing bass riffing from Mohini Dey. Dey continues with some severe stank-face on a world premiere of the funky, bass-heavy \"Run!\" from the upcoming album, locking in tastefully with The Pocket Queen on drums. Closing the set with \"Big Feelings,\" the band gets busy while WILLOW's vocals soar, effortlessly teetering between emotive highs and lows, leaving us all wanting more.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Symptom of Life\"\n\"Split\"\n\"Wait a Minute!\"\n\"Run!\"\n\"Big Feelings\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nWillow Smith: vocals   \nLiso Lee: guitar, vocals       \nZach Tenorio: keys         \nMohini Dey: bass            \nTaylor \"The Pocket Queen\" Gordon: drums      \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Ashley Pointer, Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josephine Nyounai\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Elle Mannion\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills \nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#willow #tinydesk #nprmusic"

Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny—their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.  \n \nNew and returning cast members were called on to lend their voices to the film:\n- Aaron Pierre as Mufasa\n- Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Taka, a lion prince with a bright future who accepts Mufasa into his family as a brother\n- Tiffany Boone as Sarabi\n- Kagiso Lediga as Young Rafiki\n- Preston Nyman as Zazu\n- Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros, a formidable lion with big plans for his pride \n- Thandiwe Newton as Taka’s mother, Eshe\n- Lennie James as Taka’s father, Obasi \n- Anika Noni Rose as Mufasa’s mother, Afia\n- Keith David as Mufasa’s father, Masego\n- John Kani as Rafiki\n- Seth Rogen as Pumbaa\n- Billy Eichner as Timon\n- Donald Glover as Simba\n- Introducing Blue Ivy Carter as Kiara, daughter of King Simba and Queen Nala\n- And Beyoncé Knowles-Carter as Nala\n \nAdditional casting includes Braelyn Rankins, Theo Somolu, Folake Olowofoyeku, Joanna Jones, Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, Abdul Salis and Dominique Jennings.\n\n“Mufasa: The Lion King,” the new film coming to theaters Dec. 20 explores the unlikely rise of the beloved king of the Pride Lands. The film has an all-star roster of talent bringing new and fan-favorite characters to life—plus, celebrated award-winning songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda is writing the film’s songs produced by Mark Mancina and Miranda, with additional music and performances by Lebo M. \n \nSaid Miranda, “Elton John. Tim Rice. Hans Zimmer. Lebo M. Mark Mancina. Beyoncé, Labrinth, Ilya Salmanzadeh. Beau Black, Ford Riley, the incredible music team on ‘The Lion Guard,’ and so many musical contributors over the years. ‘The Lion King’ has an incredible musical legacy with music from some of the greatest songwriters around, and I'm humbled and proud to be a part of it. It's been a joy working alongside Barry Jenkins to bring Mufasa's story to life, and we can't wait for audiences to experience this film in theaters.\"\n \nBlending live-action filmmaking techniques with photoreal computer-generated imagery, “Mufasa: The Lion King” is directed by Barry Jenkins, produced by Adele Romanski & Mark Ceryak, and executive produced by Peter Tobyansen.",
