                "description": "A strong winter storm that pounded San Diego with rain and wind Monday has wreaked havoc across the county's roadways and neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nNorthbound Interstate 15 at 32nd Street was at a standstill Monday before 1:00 p.m. due to flooding. Traffic was backed up to National City and CBS 8 coverage showed people standing outside their cars while waiting on the highway. \r\n\r\nIn the same region, homes in Mountain View around S. 42nd St. and Ocean View Boulevard saw massive flooding, after several hours of rain. Cars in the area had their tires mostly or entirely submerged as water flowed south down 42nd Street. Several feet of water mounted in front of a home on the corner of 42nd and Ocean View Boulevard as a river flowed at the back of the house.\r\n\r\nFor the latest weather forecast and alerts:\r\n\r\nCBS 8 online: https://www.cbs8.com/\r\n\r\nCBS 8 weather: https://www.cbs8.com/weather/\r\n\r\nCBS 8 APP: https://www.cbs8.com/app\r\n\r\nNEAR ME | Send us your weather photos and videos: https://www.cbs8.com/near-me\r\n\r\nSign up for the CBS 8 Newsletter: https://www.cbs8.com/email"

Directed by Michelle MacLaren (“Shining Girls,” “The Morning Show,” “Breaking Bad”), Oliver Hirschbiegel (“Downfall,” “The Experiment”) and Joseph Cedar (“Footnote,” “Our Boys”). \n\nProduced by Turbine Studios and Haut et Court TV, the series is executive produced by David Tanner (“Small Axe”), Tracey Scoffield (“Small Axe”), Caroline Benjo (“No Man’s Land”), Simon Arnal (“No Man’s Land”), Carole Scotta (“No Man’s Land”) and Justin Thomson (“Liaison”).

The San Francisco 49ers came back to beat the Green Bay Packers, led by a huge fourth quarter from Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey, while Mitch's Detroit Lions advanced to the NFC Championship with a win over Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In the AFC, Patrick Mahomes moved to 3-0 vs Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills in the playoffs and will face Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship after their win vs. CJ Stroud and the Houston Texans.  What are Richard's predictions for the Lions-49ers and Chiefs-Ravens conference championships and who are his picks to advance to the Super Bowl?\n\n00:00 - Start\n00:36 - Packers at 49ers\n06:46 - Buccaneers at Lions\n12:11 - Chiefs at Bills\n22:23 - Texans at Ravens\n24:57 - Conference Championships\n\nShop the hottest gear in all of sports podcasting: https://thevolume.com/shop-all-new\n\nFollow us on social media: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/thevolumesports\nhttps://twitter.com/TheVolumeSports\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheVolumeSports\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@thevolumesports\n\nLearn more about the Volume:\nhttps://www.thevolume.com\n\n#nfl #football #49ers #packers #chiefs #bills #ravens #texans #lions #bucs"

We were toying around with the idea of changing our RV to something more suitable for just the two of us, but the timing had to be perfect! After all, we're leaving in late March and will be on the road for most of the year. Once we hit the road, our window for buying and selling an RV would be closed. It's hard to make big changes when we're traveling and dates or events are locked in place. To our surprise, the exact Airstream (and year) we wanted showed up in a new listing, and we immediately called. After discussing price and timing, we decided to change our route to go through Visalia, CA, so we could check it out. We got started with repairs on the first night. During our self-inspection, we knew there was an issue with the voltage. We also identified a few minor issues in other systems. Because we knew we'd likely be modifying these systems anyway, we were not too uptight about it. However, it would have been good to show the \"proper\" process of buying a used RV... and not our approach. We'd like to make a video about buying & selling RVs, so we'll try to include that \"how-to\" information then. Overall, we're thrilled with this new model, and we've already started making small modifications. For those who wondered why we stayed with an Airstream, it's just the most suitable RV for how we travel. It offers us enough space to stay comfortable for months on the road, but it's small enough that we can camp inside the national parks. Not to mention resale value, which is always at the top of our list when purchasing any depreciating \"asset.\"\n\n🎬 YouTube Course https://howtostartayoutubechannel.com/ \nIf you have ever thought about starting a YouTube channel or just want even better videos to document your journey, we share everything we've learned.

This will be over three first class flights, starting in the brand new Starlux A350. After we'll move onto the brand new Emirates A380 first class, which features similar finishing to the famous Gamechanger (yes of course there's a shower onboard!). Lastly we'll finish on Etihad's three room apartment in the sky, known as The Residence. This not only has a living room, but a private ensuite bathroom and bedroom!\n\nAs usual I paid for this trip myself, and due to the complexities of the routing, I was unable to use miles to redeem. Therefore three cash tickets ended up costing over $13,000! Full costings shown in the video\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:09 - Starlux First Class\n8:34 - Emirates First Class\n16:21 - Etihad The Residence \n22:29 - The Cost",

                "description": "Get started with Odoo for free today: https://www.odoo.com/r/IgK\n\nToday i'm flying the world's best First Class flights for 24 hours from Singapore to London. This will be over three first class flights, starting in the brand new Starlux A350. After we'll move onto the brand new Emirates A380 first class, which features similar finishing to the famous Gamechanger (yes of course there's a shower onboard!). Lastly we'll finish on Etihad's three room apartment in the sky, known as The Residence. This not only has a living room, but a private ensuite bathroom and bedroom!\n\nAs usual I paid for this trip myself, and due to the complexities of the routing, I was unable to use miles to redeem. Therefore three cash tickets ended up costing over $13,000! Full costings shown in the video\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:09 - Starlux First Class\n8:34 - Emirates First Class\n16:21 - Etihad The Residence \n22:29 - The Cost"

It was an insane financial commitment and huge leap of faith that it would be the boat of our dreams.  And ever since that day…we have been preparing for this one.  The day we would go on our first sail aboard CURIOSITY², our spankin’ new HH44. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWE’RE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Why Visit Hong Kong\n02:05 Marine Store in Hong Kong\n04:51 Best Way to Find Marine Chandlers Around the World\n07:00 Victoria Harbour & Yacht Club\n09:13 Train from Hong Kong to Xiamen\n 11:01 Sea Trial Day from HH Catamarans\n14:08 Raising the Sails for the First Time\n16:31 Running through the Sail Suite \n19:34 Boat Speed & Hydro Generation Performance\n20:23 Sailing in China (Taiwan Straights)\n22:45 Sea Trials is Boat Speak for Solving Issues\n24:18 Super Quick Sailing with the Reacher\n28:45 China’s Special Pink Dolphins\n29:43 Searching for all the Imperfections\n31:42 Adventures at Low Tide\n33:37 What’s Next?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#boatlife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #sailboat #hh44\n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2024",
