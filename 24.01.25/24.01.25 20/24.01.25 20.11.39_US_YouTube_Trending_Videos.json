Jason breaks down everything that happened during his time with Bill’s mafia. We touch on everything from what he drank from the bowling ball, what Kylie thought of his decision to go shirtless, and if this was the perfect way to make a first impression. \n\nWe also recap everything else that went down during the divisional round including the Ravens suffocating win over Houston, the Lions, and the Niners pulling out a win against the Packers. \n\nWe will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs AFC Championship game in Baltimore and a full breakdown of the second round of our “Best Team Name” bracket challenge. \n\nMake sure you’re subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don’t miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - Make sure you check out all the new designs at https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nEXPERIAN: To get your Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account go to https://Experian.com/Kelce.

I can control time -- freeze and manipulate it to my advantage. This made the puzzles far more tricky and strange than anything I had seen before. Can I beat the time control escape room? Let's find out... \n\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH @Sloimay  and @Wato-1876 for designing the puzzles in this escape room. \n\nalso thanks leowook for having such a good skin for this thumbnail\n\n\n➤➤ Twitter: https://twitter.com/WifiesWasTaken\n➤➤ Discord: https://discord.gg/zAWUuWb\n\n\n➤➤Links: world download for this map in my discord server\n\n\nThis is a series called Minecraft VVSauce where I explore random features of Minecraft. Not Secret Minecraft things or Minecraft lore (like Game Theory) or Escape Rooms, but a research based series dedicated to over-answering questions you never asked.",

I can control time -- freeze and manipulate it to my advantage. This made the puzzles far more tricky and strange than anything I had seen before. Can I beat the time control escape room? Let's find out... \n\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH @Sloimay  and @Wato-1876 for designing the puzzles in this escape room. \n\nalso thanks leowook for having such a good skin for this thumbnail\n\n\n➤➤ Twitter: https://twitter.com/WifiesWasTaken\n➤➤ Discord: https://discord.gg/zAWUuWb\n\n\n➤➤Links: world download for this map in my discord server\n\n\nThis is a series called Minecraft VVSauce where I explore random features of Minecraft. Not Secret Minecraft things or Minecraft lore (like Game Theory) or Escape Rooms, but a research based series dedicated to over-answering questions you never asked."

The game has received a lot of attention since its reveal in 2021, and it finally entered Early Access on PC via Steam and on Xbox in January of 20242\n\n═════════ Video Tags ════════ \npalworld gameplay, palworld guide, palworld tips and tricks, palworld pokemon, palworld best tricks, palworld early game tips, palworld secrets, palworld dungeons, palworld mistakes, palworld best pals, palworld tools, palworld farming, palworld farming tips, palworld speed up eggs, palworld best settings, palworld world settings, palworld unlocks, palworld best secrets, palworld base guide, palworld, pal world, palworld news, palworld update, palworld patch\n\n═════════ Hashtags ═════════\n#Palworld #palworldgame #palworldgameplay",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Well, I found my friend, Bobby Parrish, and he’s going to help us find out. \n\n0:00 Introduction: Does Costco have healthy food? \n0:18 Looking for nutritious foods at Costco\n\nToday, we’re going through the aisles of hundreds of items at Costco to hunt down nutritious foods. \n\nGrocery stores are packed with unhealthy, if not dangerous, food items. It's difficult and overwhelming at times to sift through the items and make healthy choices. \n\nWe’re analyzing the nutrition content of a few different foods to help you better understand what to get and what to avoid. \n\nLet me know in the comments which foods you want to learn more about! \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 58, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting. He is the author of the best-selling book The Healthy Keto Plan, and is the Director of Dr. Berg Nutritionals. He no longer practices, but focuses on health education through social media.\n\nFollow Me On Social Media:\nFacebook:  https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg\n\nInstagram:  https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg\n\nAnchor:  https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg\n\nTikTok:  https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg\n\nDisclaimer:\nDr. Eric Berg received his Doctor of Chiropractic degree from Palmer College of Chiropractic in 1988.  His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree.  Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients so he can focus on educating people as a full time activity, yet he maintains an active license. This video is for general informational purposes only.  It should not be used to self-diagnose and it is not a substitute for a medical exam, cure, treatment, diagnosis, and prescription or recommendation.  It does not create a doctor-patient relationship between Dr. Berg and you.  You should not make any change in your health regimen or diet before first consulting a physician and obtaining a medical exam, diagnosis, and recommendation.  Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. \n\n#keto #ketodiet #weightloss #ketolifestyle \n\nThanks for watching!

We were toying around with the idea of changing our RV to something more suitable for just the two of us, but the timing had to be perfect! After all, we're leaving in late March and will be on the road for most of the year. Once we hit the road, our window for buying and selling an RV would be closed. It's hard to make big changes when we're traveling and dates or events are locked in place. To our surprise, the exact Airstream (and year) we wanted showed up in a new listing, and we immediately called. After discussing price and timing, we decided to change our route to go through Visalia, CA, so we could check it out. We got started with repairs on the first night. During our self-inspection, we knew there was an issue with the voltage. We also identified a few minor issues in other systems. Because we knew we'd likely be modifying these systems anyway, we were not too uptight about it. However, it would have been good to show the \"proper\" process of buying a used RV... and not our approach. We'd like to make a video about buying & selling RVs, so we'll try to include that \"how-to\" information then. Overall, we're thrilled with this new model, and we've already started making small modifications. For those who wondered why we stayed with an Airstream, it's just the most suitable RV for how we travel. It offers us enough space to stay comfortable for months on the road, but it's small enough that we can camp inside the national parks.

We were toying around with the idea of changing our RV to something more suitable for just the two of us, but the timing had to be perfect! After all, we're leaving in late March and will be on the road for most of the year. Once we hit the road, our window for buying and selling an RV would be closed. It's hard to make big changes when we're traveling and dates or events are locked in place. To our surprise, the exact Airstream (and year) we wanted showed up in a new listing, and we immediately called. After discussing price and timing, we decided to change our route to go through Visalia, CA, so we could check it out. We got started with repairs on the first night. During our self-inspection, we knew there was an issue with the voltage. We also identified a few minor issues in other systems. Because we knew we'd likely be modifying these systems anyway, we were not too uptight about it. However, it would have been good to show the \"proper\" process of buying a used RV... and not our approach. We'd like to make a video about buying & selling RVs, so we'll try to include that \"how-to\" information then. Overall, we're thrilled with this new model, and we've already started making small modifications. For those who wondered why we stayed with an Airstream, it's just the most suitable RV for how we travel. It offers us enough space to stay comfortable for months on the road, but it's small enough that we can camp inside the national parks. Not to mention resale value, which is always at the top of our list when purchasing any depreciating \"asset.\"\n\n🎬 YouTube Course https://howtostartayoutubechannel.com/ \nIf you have ever thought about starting a YouTube channel or just want even better videos to document your journey, we share everything we've learned.

This will be over three first class flights, starting in the brand new Starlux A350. After we'll move onto the brand new Emirates A380 first class, which features similar finishing to the famous Gamechanger (yes of course there's a shower onboard!). Lastly we'll finish on Etihad's three room apartment in the sky, known as The Residence. This not only has a living room, but a private ensuite bathroom and bedroom!\n\nAs usual I paid for this trip myself, and due to the complexities of the routing, I was unable to use miles to redeem. Therefore three cash tickets ended up costing over $13,000! Full costings shown in the video\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:09 - Starlux First Class\n8:34 - Emirates First Class\n16:21 - Etihad The Residence \n22:29 - The Cost",

This will be over three first class flights, starting in the brand new Starlux A350. After we'll move onto the brand new Emirates A380 first class, which features similar finishing to the famous Gamechanger (yes of course there's a shower onboard!). Lastly we'll finish on Etihad's three room apartment in the sky, known as The Residence. This not only has a living room, but a private ensuite bathroom and bedroom!\n\nAs usual I paid for this trip myself, and due to the complexities of the routing, I was unable to use miles to redeem. Therefore three cash tickets ended up costing over $13,000! Full costings shown in the video\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:09 - Starlux First Class\n8:34 - Emirates First Class\n16:21 - Etihad The Residence \n22:29 - The Cost"

I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them \"MEmes.\" I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes. \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\nDrawings to Squishies: turning my flat drawings into squishies\nFinishing Art Ideas: Choosing art ideas from my giant list and making them happen\nSquishies I've Been Avoiding: Painting on the squishies I DON'T want to paint\n\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nFriday at 4:00pm ET\n\n____DOWNLOAD SPARK____\nDownload Spark: https://apple.co/3gPrlWP\nJoin Discord Community: https://discord.gg/w48nSSm3s4\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 3:\nhttps://amzn.to/3OQpfEJ\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nOfficial Amazon Store:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/MoriahElizabeth/page/84A1B7AA-51AC-4B6B-AD8D-A20CCD5FCB47?ref_=ast_bln\n\nME Nail Polish\nslatebrands.com/menails\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nFOR GENERAL QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS:\nFanmail@Moriah.Video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

How much can the Cybertruck tow? How far can the Cybertruck tow? Well today we find out the answer to both of those questions.\n\nTesla usually gives out some pretty nice perks when ordering through a referral code: https://ts.la/zack10701\n\nThis is a Dual Motor All Wheel Drive CyberTruck. The Vehicle was charged up to 100% the night before this test. (The Cybertruck Probably reached 100% around 2am in the morning, and then sat in my garage for about 6 hours or so while still plugged in, before coming out of the garage and being connected to the trailer. \n\nWatch the Rivian Towing video HERE: https://youtu.be/U8zDGN2Fdt4?si=V9O2EubPFyn4SVzW\nWatch the Ford Lighting towing HERE: https://youtu.be/76l6lJhrgbc?si=NojC5JAcReN8jpuC\nWatch my 600 mile road trip with @WHATSINSIDEFAMILY HERE:  https://youtu.be/clUvjo3xfzQ?si=sB0ZOTsFwcgWTrXi\n\nAnd HUGE thanks to @OurCyberLife for letting us borrow his Cybertruck."
