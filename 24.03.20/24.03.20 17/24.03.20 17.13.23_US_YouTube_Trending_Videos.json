We are really excited to share this podcast where we examine and celebrate the game of basketball. In this first episode we ask ourselves a very simple question, \"What makes a great basketball player?\" That question launches us into discussions about the The Los Lakers recent comeback win against the Los Angeles Clippers, philosophical questions about basketball IQ and we dive into concepts like \"Thumb Down\" and \"Floppy\" and \"Horns Chest.\" We also talk about this year's leap of Jayson Tatum and The Boston Celtics and what makes them so dangerous. And finally, we dive into the influence of Stephen Curry.\n\nWe really hope you enjoy our show. Be sure to subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.

            "description": "She will return with a vengeance. Furiosa : A Mad Max Saga - Only in theaters May 24.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Academy Award-winning mastermind George Miller’s “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” the much-anticipated return to the iconic dystopian world he created more than 30 years ago with the seminal “Mad Max” films.  Miller now turns the page again with an all-new original, standalone action adventure that will reveal the origins of the powerhouse character from the multiple Oscar-winning global smash “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  The new feature from Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures is produced by Miller and his longtime partner, Oscar-nominated producer Doug Mitchell (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Babe”), under their Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner. \nAs the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus.  Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.  While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.\nTaylor-Joy stars in the title role, and along with Hemsworth, the film also stars Alyla Browne and Tom Burke. \nMiller penned the script with “Mad Max: Fury Road” co-writer Nico Lathouris.  Miller’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris, director of photography Simon Duggan (“Hacksaw Ridge,” “The Great Gatsby”), composer Tom Holkenborg, sound designer Robert Mackenzie, editor Eliot Knapman, visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson and colorist Eric Whipp. The team also includes other longtime collaborators: production designer Colin Gibson, editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, each of whom won an Oscar for their work on “Mad Max: Fury Road.” \nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, A Kennedy Miller Mitchell Production, A George Miller Film, “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, in theaters only nationwide on May 24, 2024 and internationally beginning on 22 May, 2024.",

These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body.\nGiving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses.\nFrom then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights.\nThat distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach —\nYet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery.\nIzumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore.\nDid it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again.

                "description": "Les planètes jumelles étaient enchevêtrées dans leur destin tragique, dansant un rondo éternel autour d'un grand soleil noir.\nAu commencement, l'une des planètes vit naître des humains. Ces êtres regardèrent en bas et nommèrent cette terre « Izumo ». Ils levèrent les yeux et nommèrent le monde au-dessus « Takamagahara ».\nLors d'un jour non consigné dans les chroniques, de nombreuses divinités descendirent de Takamagahara. Des bêtes maléfiques nommées par les dieux renversèrent les cieux, embrasèrent les rivières et les océans, et déchirèrent la terre. Les hommes comprirent, terrifiés, que cette invasion n'avait pas pour but la conquête, la domination, ni le pillage, mais l'extermination.\nFaisant face à une extinction imminente, Izumo s'engagea dans une entreprise déicide, mobilisant toute sa force pour terrasser la calamité connue sous le nom de « Souverain de la Révélation » et forger la toute première Lame de l'édit à partir de son corps bestial.\nCeux qui maniaient ces épées pouvaient dès lors rendre à ces dieux maléfiques la monnaie de leur pièce : en récitant les mantras contenus dans leurs lames, ils étaient capables de manipuler le pouvoir divin de Takamagahara, ce qui leur permettait de combattre ces divinités malveillantes et de venir au secours du peuple.\nAinsi commença la longue croisade d'Izumo, qui fut marquée par d'innombrables sacrifices pour abattre une divinité après l'autre et brisant d'innombrables lames mortelles afin de forger les Douze protectrices.\nDans cette lutte acharnée pour sa survie, Izumo utilisa la puissance des Lames de l'édit pour illuminer ce monde ténébreux primitif en moins de dix ères de l'Ambre, érigeant des cités rayonnant de mille couleurs...\nLe lointain royaume divin de Takama, jadis si éloigné, était désormais à portée de main.\nPourtant, c'est à ce moment-là que cette histoire prit soudainement fin. Ces deux planètes virent leur existence s'évaporer, disparaissant dans le néant.\nAujourd'hui, l'histoire d'Izumo, cette planète frontalière, ne survit que par des murmures dispersés à travers l'univers. Les universitaires ont diverses opinions concernant sa disparition, mais aucun n'a réussi à percer ce mystère.\nL'histoire d'Izumo aurait dû être un long fleuve, mais elle a été tranchée d'un seul coup, et son passé et son futur ont été effacés dans les rives du néant.\nIzumo n'a-t-elle jamais existé, n'était-ce qu'une histoire fabriquée ? Ses récits se sont-ils échoués sur les rives d'une causalité inversée ? Était-ce une autre expérience terrifiante de Dr Primitif, ou était-ce un signe du Retour de la Voracité depuis les confins du Cosmos ?\nSeul ce grand soleil noir détient la réponse. Mais il garde le silence.\nCar tout événement passé finira par retrouver son dénouement, et tout ce qui s'est terminé est destiné à se répéter. L'univers est voué à une éternelle répétition dans son ombre. Quant à Izumo, elle n'est plus qu'une simple note de bas de page, complémentant une ellipse.\n\nVoix anglaises :\nCygne noir : Arryn Zech\nAchéron : Allegra Clark\n\nTélécharger maintenant\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nSuivez-nous pour être au courant des toutes dernières informations sur le jeu !\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.FR/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Achéron"

Những con ác thú dưới cái tên \"Thần\" này đã khiến bầu trời bị đảo lộn, đại dương và sông ngòi rực lửa, mặt đất sụp đổ... Con người bàng hoàng khi nhận ra rằng đó không phải là cuộc xâm lược nhằm mục đích thống trị, chi phối hay cướp bóc. Các hung thần chỉ đến để săn giết.\nTrong giây phút tồn vong, Izumo bước chân vào con đường \"Trừ Thần\", sử dụng toàn bộ sức mạnh của đất nước ngăn đại họa \"Chúa Tể Thiên Khải\", dùng thú thể kia rèn ra \"Chiếu Đao\" đầu tiên.\nTrả đũa đối phương bằng chính cách thức của họ, bằng cách đọc thần chú ẩn chứa trong lưỡi đao, người cầm đao có thể nắm giữ thần nghiệp trong lòng bàn tay, dùng điều đó để chống lại ác thần, giải cứu thế giới.\nKể từ đó đất nước Izumo bắt đầu hành trình chinh phạt lâu dài, dùng vô số sự hy sinh để đổi lấy sự sụp đổ của từng vị thần, bẻ gãy hàng ngàn thanh kiếm trên thế giới, cuối cùng họ đã đúc được mười hai thanh \"Chiếu Đao Hộ Thế\".\nCuộc chiến sinh tồn tàn khốc, trong chưa đầy mười Hổ Phách Kỷ, đất nước Izumo đã mượn sức mạnh của Chiếu Đao để thắp sáng thế giới đen tối chưa được khai hóa.\nXây dựng một thành bang rực rỡ sắc màu, thần quốc trên bầu trời chẳng thể chạm tới trong quá khứ đã gần ngay trước mắt, chỉ cần vươn tay ra là có thể chạm đến...\nNhưng lịch sử đột ngột dừng lại vào thời điểm này, và hai hành tinh trong chớp mắt đã bị xóa sổ, biến mất không một chút dấu vết.\nNgày nay, quá khứ của hành tinh biên giới \"Izumo\" chỉ có thể được lượm lặt trong những mẩu chuyện của vũ trụ. Các học giả cũng có nhiều ý kiến khác nhau về sự biến mất của nó, nhưng không ai có thể giải mã được bí ẩn.\nLịch sử của Izumo lẽ ra phải là một dòng sông chảy dài nhưng lại bị cắt đứt chỉ bằng một vết cắt, tất cả quá khứ và tương lai đều biến mất vào phía bên kia của hư vô.\nChẳng lẽ nó chưa từng tồn tại và chỉ là một câu chuyện hư cấu? Chẳng lẽ nó chưa bao giờ xảy ra, và mắc kẹt trên bờ biển đảo lộn nhân quả?

Tuy nhiên, Ngài lại im lặng và chưa bao giờ nói điều gì.\nBởi vì mọi chuyện xảy ra đều phải có hồi kết, những thứ đã kết thúc sẽ lại xảy ra, vũ trụ sẽ tái diễn mãi mãi dưới bóng đen của Ngài, và Izumo chỉ là một chú thích cho dấu chấm lửng.\n\nCV Tiếng Anh:\nBlack Swan - Arryn Zech\nAcheron — Allegra Clark\n\nTải Ngay\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nTheo dõi chúng tôi để nhận thông tin mới nhất\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.VN/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

Mereka menundukkan kepala dan menyebut tanah di bawah kaki mereka sebagai \"Izumo\", lalu mereka mengangkat kepala dan menyebut dunia di langit sebagai \"Takamagahara\".\nPada suatu hari yang tak tercatat dalam catatan sejarah, \"Yaoyorozu no Kami\" turun dari \"Takamagahara\". Binatang jahat yang disebut \"Kami\" ini menjungkirbalikkan langit, membakar sungai dan lautan, serta menghancurkan daratan ... Orang-orang terkejut saat menyadari invasi ini bukanlah untuk menguasai, mendominasi, ataupun menjarah, melainkan hanya untuk pembasmian.\nSaat planet ini berada di ambang kematian, Izumo memulai perjalanan pembasmian \"Kami\", menghabiskan kekuatan seluruh negeri untuk membasmi \"Sovereign of Revelation\" yang membawa malapetaka dan menempa Edict Edge pertama menggunakan tubuh binatang tersebut.\nMembuat para \"Kami\" merasakan perbuatan mereka sendiri, pengguna pedang ini dapat melafalkan mantra yang terkandung di dalam pedang untuk menguasai kekuatan suci Takamagahara, dan menggunakannya untuk melawan para \"Kami\" jahat dan menyelamatkan negeri.\nSejak saat itu, Izumo memulai penaklukan yang panjang, pengorbanan yang tidak terhitung jumlahnya dilakukan sebagai bayaran atas jatuhnya para \"Kami\" satu demi satu, dan menghancurkan ribuan pedang manusia fana yang tak terhitung jumlahnya untuk membentuk 12 \"Sentinel\".\nDalam perang kejam untuk bertahan hidup, Izumo menggunakan kekuatan Edict Edge untuk menerangi dunia gelap yang tidak beradab dalam waktu kurang dari sepuluh Era Amber, membangun kota-kota dengan lampu neon yang memesona.\nTakama Divine Realm yang dulunya begitu sulit dijangkau jadi begitu dekat dalam jangkauan mereka ....\nTapi sejarah tiba-tiba berhenti di situ dan keberadaan kedua planet tersebut menghilang ke dalam ketiadaan dalam sekejap mata.\nSekarang ini, masa lalu planet perbatasan \"Izumo\" hanya dapat ditemukan dari bisikan-bisikan yang tersebar di alam semesta. Para ahli mempunyai berbagai pandangan mengenai hilangnya planet tersebut, tapi tidak ada yang bisa memecahkan misterinya.\nSejarah Izumo seharusnya merupakan sebuah sungai yang mengalir panjang, tapi sungai itu terpotong dalam satu tebasan, semua masa lalu dan masa depannya lenyap di sisi lain ketiadaan.\nApakah sungai itu tidak pernah ada, dan hanya sekadar cerita fiktif? Apakah sejarahnya tidak pernah ada dan ia kandas di pantai sebab akibat yang terbalik? Apakah ini merupakan eksperimen mengerikan lainnya yang dilakukan oleh \"Dr. Primitive\", atau apakah ini merupakan pertanda kembalinya \"Voracity\" dari ujung alam semesta?\nHanya matahari gelap itu yang tahu jawabannya, tapi \"Dia\" hanya diam dan tidak pernah bicara.\nKarena segala sesuatu yang telah terjadi suatu hari nanti akan mengalami kemunduran hingga akhir, dan segala sesuatu yang telah berakhir dijamin akan terjadi lagi.

These people looked down, and named the land below \"Izumo.\" These people looked up, and named the world above \"Takamagahara.\"\nOne day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu-no-kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body.\nGiving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses.\nFrom then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights.\nThat distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach —\nYet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery.\nIzumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore.\nDid it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again.

Sie neigten ihre Köpfe und nannten das Land unter ihren Füßen „Izumo“; dann hoben sie ihre Köpfe und nannten die Welt im Himmel „Takamagahara“.\nEines Tages stiegen „Yaoyorozu-no-kami“ aus Takamagahara herab. Diese bösen Bestien, die sich Götter nannten, ließen den Himmel einstürzen, die Meere brennen und den Erdboden zusammenbrechen ... Die Menschen waren schockiert, als sie feststellten, dass dies nicht eine Invasion zum Herrschen, Dominieren oder Plündern war, sondern dass die bösen Kami nur zur Jagd gekommen waren.\nZu dieser Zeit von Leben und Tod schlug Izumo den Weg des „Kami-Massakers“ ein, nutzte die gesamte Macht des Landes, um den schrecklichen „Gott der Offenbarung“ zu töten, und schmiedete seinen tierischen Körper zu dem ursprünglichen „Ediktschwert“.\nDurch das Rezitieren des in die Klinge eingravierten Mantras konnte ein Schwertträger Takamagaharas göttliches Schicksal in den Händen halten, um die bösen Taten der Götter zu vergelten, sie zu bekämpfen und die Welt zu retten.\nDaraufhin begann das Reich Izumo einen langen Eroberungszug, bei dem im Gegenzug für den Sturz eines Gottes nach dem anderen unzählige Opfer gebracht wurden, tausende Schwerter zerbrachen und schließlich die zwölf „Ediktschwerter zum Schutze der Welt“ geschmiedet wurden.\nIn diesem grausamen Überlebenskampf nutzte das Reich Izumo die Macht der Ediktschwerter, um die barbarische, dunkle Welt zu erhellen und schillernde Stadtstaaten zu errichten.\nDas einst unerreichbare Reich der Götter war nun in greifbare Nähe gerückt ...\nDoch die Geschichte fand in diesem Moment ein jähes Ende, als sich die Existenz zweier Planeten in Luft auflöste und sie spurlos verschwanden.\nHeute ist die Vergangenheit des Grenzsterns Izumo nur noch in wenigen Aufzeichnungen im Universum zu finden. Gelehrte sind sich über seinen Untergang uneinig, und niemand konnte das Rätsel lösen.\nDie Geschichte von Izumo hätte ein langer, fließender Fluss sein sollen, aber er wurde mit einem Messer durchtrennt, sodass die gesamte Vergangenheit und Zukunft im Nichts verschwand.\nHat Izumo etwa nie existiert und ist nur eine erfundene Geschichte? Ist dies alles etwa Fantasie, eine Verwechslung von Ursache und Wirkung? Handelt es sich um ein weiteres schreckliches Experiment von „Dr. Primitiv“, oder ist es ein Vorbote für die Rückkehr der Gier vom Ende des Kosmos?\nDie Antwort kennt nur die große, dunkle Sonne. Doch sie schweigt für immer.\nDenn alles, was geschehen ist, muss zu einem Ende kommen, und alles, was zu einem Ende gekommen ist, muss wieder geschehen.

                "description": "Две планеты вплелись в трагичные судьбы друг друга, бесконечно вращаясь вокруг огромного солнца, чёрного как смоль.\nВ начале на одной из планет появились люди. Люди взглянули вниз и назвали эту землю «Идзумо». Люди взглянули вверх и назвали эмпирей над ними «Такамагахара».\nВ один день, не описанный ни в одной книге, с Такамагахара спустились Яоёродзу но ками. Эти демонические чудища, которых прозвали «ками», перевернули небесный свод, объяли огнём моря и океаны, разломили землю. Тогда люди в ужасе поняли, что боги вторглись на их планету не для того, чтобы править или захватывать. Ками пришли, чтобы убивать.\nНа краю гибели Идзумо отправилась в карательный поход на ками. Не щадя сил, люди пытались искоренить бедствия, ниспосланные Жнецом, и в конечном итоге смогли отлить из его звериного тела самый первый Клинок Завета.\nЧтобы отплатить ками сполна за их злодеяния, кузнец зачитал над своими клинками заклинание, которое даровало тому, кто держал клинок, божественную силу Такамагахары для борьбы против демонов и спасения всего рода людского.\nТак начался тяжёлый и затяжной поход государства Идзумо, и много жизней было отдано на уничтожение ками, одного за другим. Из тысяч поломанных в бою клинков, которыми орудовали смертные, было отлито двенадцать Хранителей.\nВ кровопролитной войне за выживание жителям Идзумо понадобилось менее десяти янтарных эр, чтобы с помощью силы Клинка Завета осветить кромешный мрак их обездоленного мира и построить чудесные города, сверкающие в неоновых огнях.\nМечта о божественном государстве Такама, которая казалась недостижимой, должна была вот-вот исполниться,\nно этой истории пришёл внезапный конец - обе планеты исчезли, канув в небытие.\nСегодня о прошлом приграничной планеты Идзумо можно услышать лишь разрозненные шепотки, развеянные по вселенной. Учёные высказывают разные предположения о причинах исчезновения этой цивилизации, но никому пока не удалось разгадать эту загадку до конца.\nИстория Идзумо должна была течь тихой водой, но её поток был разрублен одним ударом. Всё прошлое и будущее этого мира осталось на том берегу звенящей пустоты.\nА существовал ли он вовсе, или это простые сказки? Возможно, этой истории и не было, или её следствия на самом деле служили причиной? Быть может, это очередной злодейский эксперимент доктора Примитива, или знамение о возвращении Эона Ненасытности с окраин космоса?\nВсё рано или поздно заканчивается, и всё начинается сызнова.\nВселенная идёт по кругу в тени Эонов, и Идзумо лишь сноска к многоточию...\n\nАнглийские CV:\nЧёрный Лебедь - Arryn Zech\nАхерон - Allegra Clark\n\nЗагрузить сейчас\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nСледите за нашими последними новостями\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nВКонтакте: https://vk.com/honkaistarrail_official\nTelegram: https://t.me/honkaistarrailofficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Ахерон"

                "description": "Os dois planetas estavam interligados nos destinos trágicos um do outro, dançando um rondó eterno em volta de um grande sol negro.\nNo começo, um dos planetas deu origem a humanos. Essa gente olhou para baixo e chamou a terra inferior de \"Izumo\". Essa gente olhou para cima e chamou o mundo superior de \"Takamagahara\".\nCerto dia, não registrado nos anais, os \"Deuses Inumeráveis\" desceram de Takamagahara. Essas feras demoníacas que eram chamadas de deuses viraram os céus de ponta-cabeça, queimaram os rios e mares, e fizeram a terra ruir. O povo percebeu, aterrorizado, que a invasão não era motivada por governança, domínio ou pilhagem. Os deuses malignos chegaram só para matar.\nCom o planeta à beira da morte, Izumo embarcou em uma jornada deicida, exaurindo as forças de toda a terra para assassinar a calamidade, \"Soberano do Apocalipse\", e aproveitando-se de seu corpo bestial para forjar a primeira Lâmina do Édito.\nEssas espadas fariam os deuses provarem de seu próprio veneno. Ao recitar o mantra contido na lâmina, seu portador podia dominar o poder divino de Takamagahara e usá-lo para combater os deuses malignos e salvar o povo.\nEntão, Izumo deu início a sua longa e árdua cruzada, sacrificando incontáveis vidas em troca da queda de uma divindade após a outra, e estilhaçando inúmeras lâminas mortais para forjar as doze Sentinelas.\nNa impiedosa luta pela sobrevivência, Izumo usou o poder das Lâminas do Édito para iluminar seu mundo tenebroso e incivilizado em menos de dez Eras de Âmbar, erguendo cidades deslumbrantes tomadas de luzes neon.\nO distante Reino Divino de Takama, antes tão longínquo, de repente estava ao seu alcance.\nMas então, a história parou. A existência dos dois planetas se evaporou instantaneamente, desaparecendo por completo.\nHoje em dia, o passado do planeta fronteiriço de Izumo só pode ser vislumbrado a partir de sussurros espalhados pelo universo. Não há consenso entre acadêmicos para a explicação de seu sumiço, e ninguém é capaz de solucionar o mistério.\nA História de Izumo deveria ter sido um extenso rio, mas foi decepada com um corte, e todo o seu passado e futuro desaguaram num mar vazio.\nSerá que o planeta nunca existiu, que não passou de uma invenção? Será que suas histórias nunca aconteceram, e ele apenas encalhou na praia da causalidade reversa? Será que foi só mais um experimento estarrecedor do Dr. Primitivo, ou talvez um sinal da Voracidade retornando do fim do cosmos?\nSomente o grande sol negro sabe a resposta, mas ele permanece em silêncio, calado.\nTudo o que acontece um dia chegará ao fim, e tudo o que já aconteceu sem dúvidas acontecerá de novo. O universo opera em eterna repetição sob a sua sombra, e Izumo não passa de uma nota de rodapé.\n\nVoz em inglês:\nCisne Negro: Arryn Zech\nAcheron: Allegra Clark\n\nBaixar Agora\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nSiga-nos para receber as novidades.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.PT\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaisr_pt\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

Esas personas inclinaron la cabeza y llamaron a la tierra bajo sus pies Izumo. Después miraron hacia arriba y llamaron al cielo sobre sus cabezas Takamagahara.\nEn algún día no registrado en los anales de historia, los Kami Innumerables descendieron de Takamagahara. Esas bestias malévolas con nombres divinos hicieron caer el cielo, quemaron las aguas y despedazaron la tierra. La humanidad se dio cuenta de que no era una invasión para gobernar, dominar o saquear; los kami malvados solo venían a matar.\nEn su lucha por la supervivencia, Izumo se embarcó en una campaña para acabar con ellos, usando el poder de toda la nación para acabar con la calamidad llamada Soberano de la Revelación, y usaron su cuerpo bestial para forjar la primera espada del decreto.\nDevolviéndoles la jugada a los kami, recitaron los mantras contenidos en las espadas, para que aquellos que las empuñaban pudiesen desafiar a los kami de Takamagahara y salvar a la humanidad de la maldad divina.\nAsí comenzó la larga cruzada de Izumo, en la que se sacrificaron innumerables vidas para derrocar a un kami tras otro, y en la que se rompieron innumerables espadas para forjar las doce Espadas Protectoras.\nEn la cruel lucha por la supervivencia, Izumo utilizó el poder de las espadas del decreto para iluminar el oscuro mundo aún sin civilizar, erigiendo brillantes ciudades en menos de diez Eras del Ámbar.\nEl reino divino de Takama, otrora tan lejano, estaba a punto de ser alcanzado.\nPero la historia llegó a su fin abruptamente. Los dos planetas desaparecieron de la noche a la mañana, sin dejar rastro.\nHoy en día, el pasado del remoto planeta Izumo solo se encuentra en fragmentos dispersos en el cosmos. Los estudiosos tienen diversas teorías sobre su desaparición, pero el misterio sigue sin resolverse.\nLa historia de Izumo debería haber sido un largo río, pero se cortó de un solo tajo, y todo su pasado y futuro desaparecieron en el vacío.\n¿Acaso nunca existió, acaso solo fue una fábula inventada? ¿Acaso nunca ocurrió, acaso fue una historia abandonada a la orilla de la causalidad inversa? ¿Fue otro cruel experimento del Dr. Primitivo, o un presagio del regreso de la Voracidad desde los confines de la galaxia?\nSolo el sol negro sabe la respuesta. Sin embargo, guarda silencio, sin decir una palabra.\nPorque todo lo que sucede está destinado a terminar, y todo lo que ha terminado está destinado a suceder nuevamente.

            "description": "*Watch More Episodes with Santi!*\nStart Binging ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ_57qANz90rqZLGfP1ZVXLKvT_jMdKlS\n\nWhat’s up, loyal Theorist?! In Santi’s FIRST episode of Food Theory, we’re looking at a _classic_ Theorist question: how can you BEST optimize your food? In this case, we’re looking specifically at spicy chicken sandwiches.

Pero... esto me hizo preguntarme por qué aún no veo muchos Tejados Solares de Tesla alrededor. Toqué este tema por primera vez en un video hace dos años, y desde entonces solo he visto un Tejado Solar en mi antiguo vecindario en Massachusetts... en comparación con docenas y docenas de hogares con paneles solares. También me han preguntado mucho por qué no instalé un Tejado Solar en mi casa nueva.\n\nPensé que podría ser interesante comparar mi casa con otra casa aquí en Nueva Inglaterra que sí tiene un Tejado Solar. Un amigo del canal, Paul Braren, me invitó a su casa para ver su configuración. Ambos sistemas se instalaron el año pasado, así que pensé que sería realmente interesante comparar los dos, las razones por las que hicimos lo que hicimos, los costos y nuestras impresiones iniciales.

Ich habe dieses Thema vor zwei Jahren in einem Video angesprochen, und seitdem habe ich nur ein Solar Roof in meiner alten Nachbarschaft in Massachusetts gesehen... im Vergleich zu Dutzenden und Dutzenden von Häusern mit Solarpanels. Ich wurde auch oft gefragt, warum ich kein Solar Roof auf meinem brandneuen Haus installiert habe.\n\nNun, ich dachte, es könnte interessant sein, mein Haus mit einem anderen Haus hier in Neuengland zu vergleichen, das ein Solar Roof besitzt. Ein Freund des Kanals, Paul Braren, hat mich eingeladen, sein Setup zu begutachten.

Denis explains how he built the \"most important\" scene of the film over the course of 44 days, with the use of various sunlight levels and blending of visual effects to make it feel edgy and real. \n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Vanity Fair on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/2z6Ya9M\r\n\r\nWant to stay in the know?

            "description": "It's hard to believe it's been almost 5 years of creating these videos. If you've been here since the beginning, I'm sure you've seen how much we've changed and grown in that time...part of that growth has been internal work that is often difficult to see. As we set new expectations for what our channel looks like going forward, it will allow us to show up in a more impactful and thoughtful way not just in our own lives but in the videos that we share with you. Also, if you’re located in Nova Scotia it’s totally worth checking out EfficiencyNS. We’re really excited to get this report back and see how we can make the cabin more efficient! https://www.EfficiencyNS.ca \n\nIf you've missed the last few episodes, we decided to buy a cabin, move into it and get comfortable for the winter. It has been a LONG 4 years of self building our home and it's time we start living again. Now that it's been a few weeks, this cozy cottage is exactly what our souls needed! \n\nWatch our weekly podcast (every Wednesday)\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@tangentswithtylerandtodd\n\nFollow us on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd\n\nJoin our Patreon Community: \nhttps://bit.ly/TylerandTodd-Patreon\n\nHow did we end up here? \nIt all began with a year of full-time travel, embracing the van life until the world shifted, and we had to adjust accordingly. With travel no longer an option but determined to stay productive, we transformed our compact mobile abode into a self-sufficient off-grid dwelling that fulfilled all our needs. Recognizing the uncertainty of the current tiny home, we quickly realized a permanent residence was the most sensible choice. Over the past three years, we have meticulously overseen every aspect of the project ourselves, planning the construction while simultaneously setting up the off-grid property to sustain our future food requirements. For the last two years we've lived in a Geodesic Dome, which has allowed us to be comfortable (expect for the winter months), while we realize our shipping container home dream. However, this will mark our 4th winter with stable electricity, running water, or a flushing toilet and time has come to come up with a new plan going forward.\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01BIM5USYLM1W",

If you've been here since the beginning, I'm sure you've seen how much we've changed and grown in that time...part of that growth has been internal work that is often difficult to see. As we set new expectations for what our channel looks like going forward, it will allow us to show up in a more impactful and thoughtful way not just in our own lives but in the videos that we share with you. Also, if you’re located in Nova Scotia it’s totally worth checking out EfficiencyNS. We’re really excited to get this report back and see how we can make the cabin more efficient! https://www.EfficiencyNS.ca \n\nIf you've missed the last few episodes, we decided to buy a cabin, move into it and get comfortable for the winter. It has been a LONG 4 years of self building our home and it's time we start living again. Now that it's been a few weeks, this cozy cottage is exactly what our souls needed! \n\nWatch our weekly podcast (every Wednesday)\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@tangentswithtylerandtodd\n\nFollow us on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd\n\nJoin our Patreon Community: \nhttps://bit.ly/TylerandTodd-Patreon\n\nHow did we end up here? \nIt all began with a year of full-time travel, embracing the van life until the world shifted, and we had to adjust accordingly. With travel no longer an option but determined to stay productive, we transformed our compact mobile abode into a self-sufficient off-grid dwelling that fulfilled all our needs. Recognizing the uncertainty of the current tiny home, we quickly realized a permanent residence was the most sensible choice. Over the past three years, we have meticulously overseen every aspect of the project ourselves, planning the construction while simultaneously setting up the off-grid property to sustain our future food requirements. For the last two years we've lived in a Geodesic Dome, which has allowed us to be comfortable (expect for the winter months), while we realize our shipping container home dream. However, this will mark our 4th winter with stable electricity, running water, or a flushing toilet and time has come to come up with a new plan going forward.\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01BIM5USYLM1W"

            "description": "Stephen Thompson | March 15, 2024\nWalking into the room shortly before Justin Timberlake took our cramped stage, I overheard someone on his team wondering aloud if this was to be the most densely populated Tiny Desk concert in history — which is to say, the most musicians we've ever fit in a single frame. It's not, but we don't often find a way to cram in this many human beings (15 in all) and this much gear.\n\nTimberlake has never been one to give partial effort, but this is a production befitting the occasion: namely, a set timed to drop concurrently with the release of his new album, Everything I Thought It Was. Eschewing the rootsier feel of its predecessor, 2018's Man of the Woods, the new record is a throwback, an epic and a blowout — and so's this lavish set, which scales the Timberlake experience down to 25 minutes of maximalist celebration and, when the moment calls for it, chiller vibes.\n\nBacked by his band The Tennessee Kids, Timberlake's Tiny Desk debut leans heavily on his early solo catalog, as he kicks it off with two songs from 2002's classic Justified and weaves in three more from 2006's magnificent FutureSex/LoveSounds — including a set-closing \"SexyBack,\" which finds the singer trotting out a megaphone in a truly meme-worthy moment.\n\nBy the way, in case you're wondering, the all-time record for musicians behind the Tiny Desk is a whopping 23, a feat pulled off by the fantastic Mucca Pazza in 2015. But Timberlake and company rival that classic performance's energy — in both cases, the real triumph lies not in the Tetris of it all, but in the way that many people still find ways to move, buoyantly and as one mighty organism.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Señorita\"\n\"Rock Your Body\"\n\"Pusher Love Girl\"\n\"Until The End Of Time\"\n\"Selfish\"\n\"What Goes Around\"\n\"SexyBack\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJustin Timberlake: lead vocals, guitar, keys\nRaVaughn Brown: vocals\nCamry: vocals\nErin Stevenson: vocals\nKenyon Dixon: vocals\nJustin Gilbert: keys\nMike Reid: drums\nElliot Ives: guitar\nDerrick Ray: bass\nLeon Silva: saxophone\nKevin Williams: trombone, flute\nDontae Winslow: trumpet\nSean Erick: trumpet\nAdam Blackstone: keys, percussion, music direction\nAndrew Hypes: DJ\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Alanté Serene, Elizabeth Gillis\nAudio Engineers: Kwesi Lee, Adam Blackstone, Danny Cheung\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#justintimberlake #nprmusic #tinydesk",

It's the idea of pure unadulterated freedom, living free from the shackles of responsibility, regulation, and reality. On a lone vessel dancing along the waves of a vast ocean, the world is truly your oyster, and the possibilities are endless! This swashbuckling fantasy has been fueled time and time again by classics like Pirates of the Caribbean in the early 2000s, Treasure Island in the late 1800s, and A General History of the Pyrates in the early 1700s. So considering how impactful the pirate genre has been on the greater populace, it might come as a shock to learn that our understanding of real pirate history is relatively meager. That last listed classic, A General History of the Pyrates by Captain Charles Johnson, remains one of our most primary sources for pirate history during the Golden Age, a novel which we know to have exaggerated and stretched the truth for sensational effect. While unfortunate, it does make sense that accurate recordings of the true history of piracy are scarce given the criminal and elusive nature of pirates themselves. One isn't really an efficient criminal by making their personal information as known as possible. Combine that with the fact that most pirates came from poverty and low social status, and the fact that many primary court documents have been lost to time, it makes sense that this history can be hard to accurately map and result in much speculation. In this video, much speculation must be made to connect the dots we have about Stede Bonnet's life for example. Naturally, this can lead to inaccurate assumptions, so with that in mind I tried my best to choose language carefully when telling this story. Take note of the numerous sentences initiated with, \"It's believed\" for some insight into when speculations are made. \n\nThe illusiveness of pirate history feeds into the fantasy. After all, these were criminals, and if we could go back in time and ask them, we'd find many of them wouldn't choose this way of life if given the choice. The story of piracy is the story of class struggle, with rare exceptions like Bonnet aside, the lowest rungs of society were the ones who populated the pirate ranks. Poor sailors who lost their livelihood, impressment victims seeking freedom, privateers losing their state-backed support, and those with nowhere to turn but the sea were the ones who became pirates. It's a position born out of struggle and poverty, the same struggle that can be seen with the Somali pirates in the modern day. In essence, they are no different than the glorified pirates of the Caribbean: disadvantaged victims of society merely doing what they can to survive. \n\nWorks Consulted / Read More: \n\n(Will add later)",

On a lone vessel dancing along the waves of a vast ocean, the world is truly your oyster, and the possibilities are endless! This swashbuckling fantasy has been fueled time and time again by classics like Pirates of the Caribbean in the early 2000s, Treasure Island in the late 1800s, and A General History of the Pyrates in the early 1700s. So considering how impactful the pirate genre has been on the greater populace, it might come as a shock to learn that our understanding of real pirate history is relatively meager. That last listed classic, A General History of the Pyrates by Captain Charles Johnson, remains one of our most primary sources for pirate history during the Golden Age, a novel which we know to have exaggerated and stretched the truth for sensational effect. While unfortunate, it does make sense that accurate recordings of the true history of piracy are scarce given the criminal and elusive nature of pirates themselves. One isn't really an efficient criminal by making their personal information as known as possible. Combine that with the fact that most pirates came from poverty and low social status, and the fact that many primary court documents have been lost to time, it makes sense that this history can be hard to accurately map and result in much speculation. In this video, much speculation must be made to connect the dots we have about Stede Bonnet's life for example. Naturally, this can lead to inaccurate assumptions, so with that in mind I tried my best to choose language carefully when telling this story. Take note of the numerous sentences initiated with, \"It's believed\" for some insight into when speculations are made. \n\nThe illusiveness of pirate history feeds into the fantasy. After all, these were criminals, and if we could go back in time and ask them, we'd find many of them wouldn't choose this way of life if given the choice. The story of piracy is the story of class struggle, with rare exceptions like Bonnet aside, the lowest rungs of society were the ones who populated the pirate ranks. Poor sailors who lost their livelihood, impressment victims seeking freedom, privateers losing their state-backed support, and those with nowhere to turn but the sea were the ones who became pirates. It's a position born out of struggle and poverty, the same struggle that can be seen with the Somali pirates in the modern day. In essence, they are no different than the glorified pirates of the Caribbean: disadvantaged victims of society merely doing what they can to survive. \n\nWorks Consulted / Read More: \n\n(Will add later)"

It was also a step forward for the space company making it a success, but far from a complete success as both booster and Starship failed to control themselves all the way to landing, and at least one on Orbit test - the engine relight failed.\nThe starship on orbit failed to maintain attitude during the initial reentry phase and this doomed the spacecraft to a fiery disintegration over the Indian Ocean.\nCongratulations to SpaceX on setting new records - let's get some soft landings next time.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley",

Ok well by brand new I really mean that I took an existingly great format cultivated by @dream  in minecraft and just hamfisted it into the skyrim together mod which has the netcode stability of crumbs. Today The Spiffing Brit (Skyrim Exploiter), Doug Doug (Skyrim Speedrunner), ItsJabo (Skyrim Hater) and Joov (Skyrim Hunter) will have to hunt down and assassinate NPCs, Bandits and humanoids scattered across the holds of skyrim! However if any of the hunters manage to kill one another their score is locked and they must begin hunting down the other players! Whoever has defeated the most humans by the end of the time limit wins! However todays challenge is filled with twists, turns and crashes so who knows what wonderful skyrim multiplayer exploits will be discovered today! So get ready for skyrim together reborn pushed to its limits with all new styles of gameplay memes and challenges for spiff to deal with!

Ok well by brand new I really mean that I took an existingly great format cultivated by @dream  in minecraft and just hamfisted it into the skyrim together mod which has the netcode stability of crumbs. Today The Spiffing Brit (Skyrim Exploiter), Doug Doug (Skyrim Speedrunner), ItsJabo (Skyrim Hater) and Joov (Skyrim Hunter) will have to hunt down and assassinate NPCs, Bandits and humanoids scattered across the holds of skyrim! However if any of the hunters manage to kill one another their score is locked and they must begin hunting down the other players! Whoever has defeated the most humans by the end of the time limit wins! However todays challenge is filled with twists, turns and crashes so who knows what wonderful skyrim multiplayer exploits will be discovered today! So get ready for skyrim together reborn pushed to its limits with all new styles of gameplay memes and challenges for spiff to deal with! Some have tried Skyrim co-op but today we try skyrim pvp! \n\nA huge thank you to @DougDoug, @ItsJabo and @Joov for taking part in todays video.

                "description": "As new questions arise about Boeing’s troubled 737 Max jet, FRONTLINE and The New York Times update an award-winning investigation into the design, oversight and production of a plane that was involved in two crashes that killed 346 people.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​\n\nIn October 2018, a Boeing 737 Max passenger jet crashed shortly after takeoff off the coast of Indonesia. Five months later, following an eerily similar flight pattern, another 737 Max 8 went down in Ethiopia. Everyone on board the flights died.\n\n\"Boeing's Fatal Flaw\" tells the inside story of what led up to the crashes — revealing how intense market pressure and failed oversight contributed to tragic deaths and a catastrophic crisis for one of the world’s most iconic industrial names.\n\nThis updated documentary also examines what’s happened since the original film first aired in 2021, including the January 2024 Alaska Airlines incident where a panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max jet’s body midair, and how Boeing has responded.\n\nExplore additional reporting related to \"Boeing’s Fatal Flaw\" on our website: \nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/boeings-fatal-flaw/\n\n#Documentary #Boeing #737Max #AirlineSafety\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS. Funding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Additional support for FRONTLINE is provided by the Abrams Foundation, Park Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation, and the FRONTLINE Journalism Fund, with major support from Jon and Jo Ann Hagler on behalf of the Jon L. Hagler Foundation, and additional support from Koo and Patricia Yuen.\n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00 - Prologue\n01:05 - Boeing 737 Max Crashes on Indonesian and Ethiopian Airlines\n19:20 - The FAA’s Regulatory Oversight of Boeing’s 737 Max\n45:27 - Blowout on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max Plane\n51:58 - Credits"

The vibes the whole day were so warm, the energy was lovely, and all of the people who contributed their love and talent are so deeply appreciated for making this video so fun and special. Most importantly thank you to YUNJIN for truly completing this song and making it such a wonderful piece and thank you to my brother, my friend, and one of my favorite creators and directors in the world Miles Murphy for going on an adventure around the world with me to direct it.

We got to really explore and adventure around a city and country that has shown me so much love and that means so much to me. YUNJIN and I really had so much fun on set making this video. The vibes the whole day were so warm, the energy was lovely, and all of the people who contributed their love and talent are so deeply appreciated for making this video so fun and special. Most importantly thank you to YUNJIN for truly completing this song and making it such a wonderful piece and thank you to my brother, my friend, and one of my favorite creators and directors in the world Miles Murphy for going on an adventure around the world with me to direct it.
