            "description": "92 %ers, and probably a lot of you entering your “football era”, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Accelerator Active Energy! \n\nIn this episode, we break down the Eagles' dominant win on Monday Night Football, how much better this Eagles D-line might be than last year and the right time to go for the hurdle. \n\nWe also recap the most talked about 30-point win in the history of the NFL, the Chiefs' big win against the Bears. We’ll get to why the Chiefs offense is finally clicking, Big Red’s career milestone, and we finally talk about it, Taylor Swift paid a visit to the Chiefs Kingdom. \n\nAlso, we answer some not-dumb football questions from the Swifties, try and figure out just how the Dolphins dropped 70 on the Broncos, and let you know if we would have kicked the record-breaking field goal. \n\nThis Friday we will be dropping our incredible episode with The Chiefs Chris “Stone Cold” Jones! The guys talk about everything from his new contract, his wardrobe malfunction at the combines, what he likes least about offensive linemen, and why he wants to get lined up against Tyreek Hill. \n\nMake sure you’re subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don’t miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nACCELERATOR ACTIVE ENERGY: Available nationwide at Target or visit https://ashoc.com/ to find the store nearest you.  \n\nSTATE FARM: https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/multiline or talk to a State Farm agent today to learn how you can bundle and save with the Personal Price Plan.

                "description": "92 %ers, and probably a lot of you entering your “football era”, we are back with another episode of New Heights presented by our friends at Accelerator Active Energy! \n\nIn this episode, we break down the Eagles' dominant win on Monday Night Football, how much better this Eagles D-line might be than last year and the right time to go for the hurdle. \n\nWe also recap the most talked about 30-point win in the history of the NFL, the Chiefs' big win against the Bears. We’ll get to why the Chiefs offense is finally clicking, Big Red’s career milestone, and we finally talk about it, Taylor Swift paid a visit to the Chiefs Kingdom. \n\nAlso, we answer some not-dumb football questions from the Swifties, try and figure out just how the Dolphins dropped 70 on the Broncos, and let you know if we would have kicked the record-breaking field goal. \n\nThis Friday we will be dropping our incredible episode with The Chiefs Chris “Stone Cold” Jones! The guys talk about everything from his new contract, his wardrobe malfunction at the combines, what he likes least about offensive linemen, and why he wants to get lined up against Tyreek Hill. \n\nMake sure you’re subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don’t miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nACCELERATOR ACTIVE ENERGY: Available nationwide at Target or visit https://ashoc.com/ to find the store nearest you.  \n\nSTATE FARM: https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/multiline or talk to a State Farm agent today to learn how you can bundle and save with the Personal Price Plan.

But when the plots of Elly’s fictional books—which center on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate—begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.\n \nAccompanied by Aiden (Oscar® winner Sam Rockwell), a cat-allergic spy, Elly (carrying Alfie in her backpack) races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between Elly’s fictional world and her real one begins to blur.\n \nThe top-flight ensemble cast features Henry Cavill (The Witcher), John Cena (Fast X), Oscar® winner Ariana DeBose (West Side Story), Grammy winning pop superstar Dua Lipa (Barbie), Emmy winner and Oscar® nominee Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Emmy winner and comedy icon Catherine O’Hara (Schitt’s Creek), Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service), and the legendary Samuel L. Jackson. Alfie is played by Chip, the real-life cat of supermodel Claudia Vaughn (née Schiffer).\n \nArgylle is directed and produced by Matthew Vaughn, from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs (Wonder Woman). The film is produced by Matthew Vaughn, Adam Bohling (Kingsman franchise), Jason Fuchs, and David Reid (Kingsman franchise). The executive producers are Adam Fishbach, Zygi Kamasa, Carlos Peres and Claudia Vaughn.\n \nApple Original Films presents, in association with MARV, a Cloudy production.

Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe—the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico—to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Featuring the voices of Academy Award®-winning actor Ariana DeBose as Asha, Chris Pine as Magnifico, and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino, the film is helmed by Oscar®-winning director Chris Buck (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), and produced by Peter Del Vecho (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Juan Pablo Reyes Lancaster Jones (“Encanto”). Jennifer Lee (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) executive produces—Lee and Allison Moore (“Night Sky,” “Manhunt”) are writers on the project. With original songs by Grammy®-nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer/songwriter/musician Benjamin Rice, plus score by composer Dave Metzger, “Wish” opens only in theaters on Nov. 22, 2023. \n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneywishmovie/ / https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\n\nHashtag: #Wish",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

This time, however, artists will select their own songs to perform.\n\nOnce the Live Performance Shows begin, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast. This time, the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists.

At least that’s what they said for this barbeque challenge… Cousins barbeque in Fort Worth Texas offers an all you can eat Texas barbeque for only $25.

            "description": "Today we completely dismantle a new iPhone 15 Pro Max to see how much titanium Apple has overlayed onto their aluminum frame. Anker Nano USB-C Fast Charging Lineup for iPhone 15 on Amazon: https://ankerfast.club/HNUBgh and on Anker.com: https://shop.anker.com/21iTX8 According to lab tests, the 5,000mAh Anker Nano Power Bank can charge an iPhone 15 to 79%. Power loss from internal components may prevent a full charge.\n\nTitanium is a really expensive material. Titanium is also EXTREMELY difficult to work with. But its really cool to see how Apple has assembled their new iPhone 15 Pro Max from the inside. We also take apart Apple's Tetra-Prism camera to see how the 5x Telephoto lens functions. \n\nGet my Teardown Skin for your phone HERE: https://www.dbrand.com/teardown\nGet my JerryRig Razor knife HERE: https://www.jerryrigknife.com/\n\nFollow me for updates! \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/zacksjerryrig \nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/1U4bQqv \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ZacksJerryRig \n\nLARGE tool kit: http://amzn.to/2DURcr7 \nTravel Tool Kit: https://amzn.to/30LKXOY \nMega Tool Kit: https://amzn.to/2OwequL \nPlastic Pry tools: http://amzn.to/1Tu57pI \nMetal phone opening tool: http://amzn.to/1WdOFv0 \nThe camera I used to film this video: http://amzn.to/2p7GtkX (GH6 https://amzn.to/3LyfW8d) \nThe Lens I used for this video: http://amzn.to/1QOXDw2 \nWide angle lens: http://amzn.to/2qiYM4u \nAnd this Metabones adapter: http://amzn.to/2iZ67Ty \nThis is the drone I use: https://amzn.to/3JEuTXs \n\nTO SEND ME STUFF: See my P.O.

Go to our sponsor https://betterhelp.com/eamonandbec for 10% off your first month of therapy with BetterHelp and get matched with a therapist who will listen and help. \n\nLooking for great teas?

            "description": "It's November 11, 2011. Todd Howard has just unleashed Skyrim into the world. No patches. Release build. Take his word for it: it just works. Join me today as I play through the original release of Skyrim, but every time I encounter a glitch, bug or exploit.. my health is reduced by 5. It's going to be quite a journey...  \n\nA HUGE THANK YOU TO Nighthawk and the Team at Skyblivion for helping duct tape together a working copy of the release build of skyrim for me! And No I cannot legally distribute it to you sorry...\n\nAs Bethesda have just released starfield that has been a relatively bug free game excluding all of the exploits I felt it was important to go back in time and see if we can compare the release build of skyrim to a starfield review of sorts. Now as Todd Howard would never lie and every one of his games have the it just works seal of gameplay approval it is impossible for us to have a non perfectly balanced experience! So begone Skyrim Anniversary edition because we are going to the original! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n\nChapters\n00:00 - Skyrim Release Build\n01:05 - Back Again!\n03:32 - Meet Nord Nordinson\n04:36 - The Glitches Begin\n08:10 - Our Journey Finally Begins…\n13:14 - Out into the world!\n19:24 - Faendal no!\n21:55 - Off to Whiterun…\n24:37 - Let’s Fight a Dragon!\n28:57 - Thanks, Todd\n33:55 - Meet Skyrim - 480p mode\n36:42 - Horse Shenanigans\n39:57 - My Great Folly (which is Todd’s Fault)\n41:11 - BIG FINISH\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: Can I Beat Skyrim's Release Build?

Join me today as I play through the original release of Skyrim, but every time I encounter a glitch, bug or exploit.. my health is reduced by 5. It's going to be quite a journey...  \n\nA HUGE THANK YOU TO Nighthawk and the Team at Skyblivion for helping duct tape together a working copy of the release build of skyrim for me! And No I cannot legally distribute it to you sorry...\n\nAs Bethesda have just released starfield that has been a relatively bug free game excluding all of the exploits I felt it was important to go back in time and see if we can compare the release build of skyrim to a starfield review of sorts. Now as Todd Howard would never lie and every one of his games have the it just works seal of gameplay approval it is impossible for us to have a non perfectly balanced experience! So begone Skyrim Anniversary edition because we are going to the original! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage.

            "description": "We’ve wanted to plant an orchard on our homestead for YEARS to grow our own food…today is finally the day! Go to our sponsor https://betterhelp.com/tylertodd for 10% off your first month of therapy! \n\nThe idea to build a shipping container home was definitely one of the wildest ones we've had and if you've been joining our weekly videos for any amount of time you know that's saying something. Without question, it's a project that is much more difficult than we thought it would be but we're having fun along the way and that's what counts. Join us every Sunday as we continue to create off the grid homestead vlogs, sharing our adventures as we build our own alternative lifestyle of living off the land and building a home out of shipping containers!\n\nJoin us on Patreon where we have over 30 never before seen episodes AND 50+ videos...hours and hours of entertainment to binge watch!\nhttps://bit.ly/TylerandTodd-Patreon\n\nInstagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd\n\nEnjoying the music? Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMusicbed SyncID: \nMB01Q7KG9GU69QL",

Go to our sponsor https://betterhelp.com/tylertodd for 10% off your first month of therapy! \n\nThe idea to build a shipping container home was definitely one of the wildest ones we've had and if you've been joining our weekly videos for any amount of time you know that's saying something. Without question, it's a project that is much more difficult than we thought it would be but we're having fun along the way and that's what counts. Join us every Sunday as we continue to create off the grid homestead vlogs, sharing our adventures as we build our own alternative lifestyle of living off the land and building a home out of shipping containers!\n\nJoin us on Patreon where we have over 30 never before seen episodes AND 50+ videos...hours and hours of entertainment to binge watch!\nhttps://bit.ly/TylerandTodd-Patreon\n\nInstagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd\n\nEnjoying the music? Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist \n\nHow did we get here? \nAfter a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMusicbed SyncID: \nMB01Q7KG9GU69QL"

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, JC Chasez, Lance Bass, and Joey Fatone have sold more than 70 million records, toured the world, and endured as one of the defining pop groups of a generation. They're reunited not only for this record-breaking episode (most wings on the table!), but also with a brand-new single, \"Better Place,\" dropping September 29. But how are they with spicy food?

Thunderbolt 4 cables or serial port connectors?\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1532434-we-will-buy-everything-in-this-mom-pop-computer-store/\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.\n\n► GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n► GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n► SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners\n► EQUIPMENT WE USE TO FILM LTT: https://lmg.gg/LTTEquipment\n► OUR WAN PODCAST GEAR: https://lmg.gg/wanset\n\nFOLLOW US \n---------------------------------------------------  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/linustech\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/LinusTech\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/linustech\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@linustech\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/linustech\n\nMUSIC CREDIT\n---------------------------------------------------\nIntro: Laszlo - Supernova\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfxmFU3lWY\niTunes Download Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/supernova/id936805712\nArtist Link: https://soundcloud.com/laszlomusic\n\nOutro: Approaching Nirvana - Sugar High\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngsGBSCDwcI\nListen on Spotify: http://spoti.fi/UxWkUw\nArtist Link: http://www.youtube.com/approachingnirvana\n\nIntro animation by MBarek Abdelwassaa https://www.instagram.com/mbarek_abdel/\nMonitor And Keyboard by vadimmihalkevich / CC BY 4.0  https://geni.us/PgGWp\nMechanical RGB Keyboard by BigBrotherECE / CC BY 4.0 https://geni.us/mj6pHk4\nMouse Gamer free Model By Oscar Creativo / CC BY 4.0 https://geni.us/Ps3XfE\n\nCHAPTERS\n---------------------------------------------------\n0:00 Intro\n0:49 Thanks Ridge!\n1:21 First Batch\n4:52 Clearance Shelf\n6:33 Third Batch\n7:34 Fourth Batch\n9:25 GPU Bunch\n12:00 Batch Number 6\n13:22 BUZZ LIGHTYEAR\n13:54 Batches 7 and 8\n16:51 Cable Wall\n20:38 Another Wall\n22:17 Laptops\n23:27 The Really Old Stuff\n25:44 Random Garbage?\n29:53 Ridge x Hennessey\n30:22 Last Case\n33:05 GRAND TOTAL\n33:50 Outro"
