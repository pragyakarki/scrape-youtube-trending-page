            "description": "50 വയസ്സ് കഴിഞ്ഞാലും ഒരുമുടിപോലും നരക്കില്ല  മുടി വേരുമുതൽകറുക്കും  ഇങ്ങനെ ചെയ്താൽ/Dr Manoj Johnson /#drshimji \n\nCauses of premature hair graying\n\nThe exact cause of premature hair graying is not fully understood, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nGenetics is the biggest factor in premature hair graying. If your parents or grandparents went gray early, you are more likely to do the same.\n\nEnvironmental factors that may contribute to premature hair graying include:\n\nStress: Stress can damage hair follicles and accelerate the graying process.\nSmoking: Smoking can damage DNA and hair follicles, leading to premature graying.\nMedical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disease, vitiligo, and alopecia areata, can cause premature hair graying.\nNutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12, vitamin D, and copper, can also contribute to premature hair graying.\nCare and prevention of premature hair graying\n\nThere is no guaranteed way to prevent premature hair graying, but there are some things you can do to help keep your hair looking its best:\n\nEat a healthy diet: Make sure to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This will help ensure that you are getting the nutrients your hair needs to stay healthy.\nReduce stress: Stress can damage hair follicles and accelerate the graying process. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, yoga, or meditation.\nQuit smoking: Smoking can damage DNA and hair follicles, leading to premature graying. Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your overall health, including your hair health.\nProtect your hair from the sun: The sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage hair follicles and accelerate the graying process. When you are outdoors, wear a hat or scarf to protect your hair from the sun.\nUse gentle hair products: Avoid using harsh hair products that can damage hair follicles. Choose gentle shampoos and conditioners, and avoid using heat styling tools too often.\nIf you are concerned about premature hair graying, talk to your doctor. They can help you identify any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the problem. They can also recommend other treatments or lifestyle changes that may help.",

                "description": "50 വയസ്സ് കഴിഞ്ഞാലും ഒരുമുടിപോലും നരക്കില്ല  മുടി വേരുമുതൽകറുക്കും  ഇങ്ങനെ ചെയ്താൽ/Dr Manoj Johnson /#drshimji \n\nCauses of premature hair graying\n\nThe exact cause of premature hair graying is not fully understood, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nGenetics is the biggest factor in premature hair graying. If your parents or grandparents went gray early, you are more likely to do the same.\n\nEnvironmental factors that may contribute to premature hair graying include:\n\nStress: Stress can damage hair follicles and accelerate the graying process.\nSmoking: Smoking can damage DNA and hair follicles, leading to premature graying.\nMedical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disease, vitiligo, and alopecia areata, can cause premature hair graying.\nNutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12, vitamin D, and copper, can also contribute to premature hair graying.\nCare and prevention of premature hair graying\n\nThere is no guaranteed way to prevent premature hair graying, but there are some things you can do to help keep your hair looking its best:\n\nEat a healthy diet: Make sure to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This will help ensure that you are getting the nutrients your hair needs to stay healthy.\nReduce stress: Stress can damage hair follicles and accelerate the graying process. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, yoga, or meditation.\nQuit smoking: Smoking can damage DNA and hair follicles, leading to premature graying. Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your overall health, including your hair health.\nProtect your hair from the sun: The sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage hair follicles and accelerate the graying process. When you are outdoors, wear a hat or scarf to protect your hair from the sun.\nUse gentle hair products: Avoid using harsh hair products that can damage hair follicles. Choose gentle shampoos and conditioners, and avoid using heat styling tools too often.\nIf you are concerned about premature hair graying, talk to your doctor. They can help you identify any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the problem. They can also recommend other treatments or lifestyle changes that may help."

This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant.

'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu.
