Ta jaskinia jest tak ogromna, że ​​ma całkowicie samowystarczalny ekosystem z własnymi warunkami klimatycznymi. Setki metrów pod ziemią chmury, które zwykle widzisz na niebie, tworzą się w tej jaskini.\n\nSon Doong ma nawet nietknięty prehistoryczny las deszczowy ukryty daleko pod powierzchnią i ogromną podziemną rzekę. Od przezroczystych ryb po kolorowe małpy, ponad 250 endemicznych gatunków roślin i zwierząt żyje w tym podziemnym świecie. Niedawno odkryto tutaj siedem nowych gatunków zwierząt, które są unikalne dla tego miejsca. Ta jaskinia o długości 9 kilometrów mieści 38,5 miliona metrów sześciennych przestrzeni. A jej przejścia są tak ogromne, że zmieściłby się w nich 40-piętrowy wieżowiec, a jej gigantyczne stalagmity wznoszą się niczym wieże starożytnych miast. Wchodząc do środka, nie sposób nie poczuć się małym jak malutki robaczek. Son Doong zawiera nawet skały fitokrasowe, które poruszają się w kierunku słońca jak półżywe organizmy. Znajdują się tu również rzadkie perły jaskiniowe i wiele innych unikalnych formacji.\n\nPrzez 3 miliony lat od jej powstania świat nie miał pojęcia o istnieniu tej jaskini, dopóki nie została w pełni zbadana w 2009 roku w Wietnamie. Teraz nadszedł czas, abyś zobaczył największą jaskinię na Ziemi.\n\nWstęp indywidualny jest zabroniony w celu ochrony zarówno zwiedzających, jak i delikatnego środowiska.

Bu mağara o kadar büyük ki, kendi iklim koşullarına sahip tamamen kendi kendini idame ettiren bir ekosisteme sahip. Yerin yüzlerce metre altında, gökyüzünde görmeye alışkın olduğunuz bulutlar bu mağaranın içinde oluşuyor.\n\nSon Doong'da, yüzeyin çok altında saklı, el değmemiş bir tarih öncesi yağmur ormanı ve geniş bir yeraltı nehri bile var. Şeffaf balıklardan renkli maymunlara kadar, bu yeraltı dünyasında 250'den fazla endemik bitki ve hayvan türü yaşıyor. Burada yakın zamanda yedi yeni hayvan türü keşfedildi ve bunlar buraya özgü. 9 kilometre uzunluğundaki bu mağara, 38,5 milyon metreküp alan kaplıyor. Ve geçitleri o kadar muazzam ki içine 40 katlı bir gökdelen sığabilir ve dev sarkıtları antik kentlerin kuleleri gibi yükseliyor. İçeriye girdiğinizde kendinizi küçük bir böcek kadar küçük hissetmemeniz imkansız. Son Doong, yarı canlı organizmalar gibi güneşe doğru hareket eden fitokarst kayaçları bile içeriyor. Nadir mağara incileri ve diğer birçok benzersiz oluşum da burada bulunuyor.\n\nOluşumundan bu yana geçen 3 milyon yıl boyunca, dünya 2009 yılında Vietnam'da tamamen keşfedilene kadar bu mağaranın varlığından habersizdi. Şimdi, dünyanın en büyük mağarasını görmenizin zamanı geldi.\n\nHem ziyaretçileri hem de kırılgan çevreyi korumak için bireysel erişim yasaktır. Bu keşif gezisi, tek yetkili kuruluş olan Oxalis tarafından yürütülmektedir.\n\nNot: Bu video ücretli bir tanıtım içermektedir!"

                "description": "Thank you, Opera, for sponsoring this video! Upgrade your browsing experience with Opera:  https://opr.as/03-Opera-browser-ruhicenetvideos\nIf you want to learn more about Son Doong or visit Son Doong, you can check Oxalis's website:  https://www.oxalisadventure.com\n\nSon Doong, the largest cave on our planet. This cave is so massive that it has a completely self-sustaining ecosystem with its own climate conditions. Hundreds of meters underground, the clouds you're used to seeing in the sky form inside this cave. \n\nSon Doong even has an untouched prehistoric rainforest hidden far below the surface and a vast underground river. From transparent fish to colorful monkeys, over 250 endemic plant and animal species live in this underground world. Seven new animal species were recently discovered here and are unique to this place. Stretching 9 kilometers in length, this cave holds 38.5 million cubic meters of space. And its passages are so enormous that a 40-story skyscraper could fit inside and its giant stalagmites are rising like the towers of ancient cities. Walking inside, it’s impossible not to feel as small as a tiny bug. Son Doong even contains phytokarst rocks, which move towards the sun like semi-living organisms. Rare cave pearls and many other unique formations are also found here.\n\nFor 3 million years since its formation, the world had no idea about this cave's existence until it was fully explored in 2009 in Vietnam. Now, it’s time for you to see the largest cave on earth. \nIndividual access is forbidden to protect both visitors and the fragile environment. This expedition is operated by Oxalis, the only authorized agency.\n\nNote: This video contains a paid promotion! Also, the flooding footage between 2:09 and 2:13 are shot by Ryan Deboodt.\nSubscribe to our channel from here ► https://goo.gl/MKi8tn\n\"Rediscovery\" Series ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40Eh9f0PRRXcCkyKxrtRvE3tbmcKYvHr\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth (It Took 8 Days, I Lost 10kg) ► https://youtu.be/OPUTLWhhqCo\nVisiting the Fattest, Most Cigarette-Addicted and Least Visited Country 🇳🇷 ► https://youtu.be/eUJgq9HerDQ\nVisiting the World's Hottest Place (70°C, 159°F) LUT DESERT ► https://youtu.be/NhyDkHaUC8U\nVisiting the World’s Most Daпgeгous Road: “Karakoram D℮ath Road” (There are casuaIti℮s!) ► https://youtu.be/FryCzL17YRs\nVisiting the MOST AIR POLLUTED CITY in the World (Dust Hell) ► https://youtu.be/zC4saZg6sG0\nVisiting the COLDEST CITY in the World (-71°C, -96°F) YAKUTSK / YAKUTIA ► https://youtu.be/Fz4ZMLsPzqM\n8 Crazy Experiments at -55°C, -67°F (The coldest city in the World: Yakutsk) ► https://youtu.be/ExoOL2lwlWE\nWorld's Poorest Country \"Burundi\" (I can’t forget the things I saw) ► https://youtu.be/n0gFsHf9cIw\n\nMy name is Ruhi Çenet, I'm an independent documentary maker.

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement. Also interwoven in its fast-paced plots are the personal challenges that the C.I.D. team faces with non-stop adventure, tremendous pressure, and risk, all in the name of duty. The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam]. While the stories are plausible, there is an emphasis on dramatic plotting and technical complexities faced by the police.
