Now, she finds herself once again in the waiting room of Brighter Days Inc., but this time for a very different appointment. The company now offers advanced memory restoration, allowing her to revisit a curated selection of moments from her life—both cherished and painful. As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today. She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma. In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there’s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\n \nSet against the music of eternal sunshine deluxe: brighter days ahead, and directed by frequent collaborators Christian Breslauer and Ariana Grande, this film explores love, loss, growth, and the fleeting nature of memory, delivering a heartfelt cinematic experience that closes the door on this eternal sunshine album era.\n\n►Subscribe to Ariana Grande: http://ArianaGrande.lnk.to/subscribe\n \n►Follow Ariana Grande\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/arianagrande/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/arianagrande \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@arianagrande\nWebsite: https://www.arianagrande.com/ \n \n#arianagrande #brighterdaysahead #eternalsunshine\n\n\nMusic video by Ariana Grande performing brighter days ahead.© 2025 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.",

            "description": "In Part 2 of our sit-down with Drake Bell, we pick up right where we left off—unpacking everything that came after the show ended. From personal regrets to private reconciliations, we reflect on the years apart, the moments that shaped us, and how we finally found our way back to friendship.\n\nWe talk openly about what drove us apart and what’s bringing us back together. Drake shares unbelievable stories—playing a private concert in Switzerland for eight kids, becoming a children’s menu icon in Mexico, and his surreal trip to Brunei with Pamela Anderson. But he also opens up about the real stuff: going to rehab, becoming a father, learning to survive—and then choosing to live fully.\n\nWe revisit our shared past with fresh perspective and a whole lot more grace. It’s funny, it’s heartbreaking, it’s hopeful—and it’s the closure we didn’t know we needed.\n\nWe love this episode. We love Drake.

From personal regrets to private reconciliations, we reflect on the years apart, the moments that shaped us, and how we finally found our way back to friendship.\n\nWe talk openly about what drove us apart and what’s bringing us back together. Drake shares unbelievable stories—playing a private concert in Switzerland for eight kids, becoming a children’s menu icon in Mexico, and his surreal trip to Brunei with Pamela Anderson. But he also opens up about the real stuff: going to rehab, becoming a father, learning to survive—and then choosing to live fully.\n\nWe revisit our shared past with fresh perspective and a whole lot more grace. It’s funny, it’s heartbreaking, it’s hopeful—and it’s the closure we didn’t know we needed.\n\nWe love this episode. We love Drake.

You can register to play the game here: https://tanks.ly/TheSpiffingBrit\n\nWelcome to Cities Skylines 2 the second game in the cities skylines series that is now 10 years old! Of course with all of that time and experience the developers have become experts at creating. Now as a pro Economist in a past life I am of course capable of using some high level city planning strategies to break the game. Today The Spiffing Brit will be building the perfect city by using an infinite money glitch and some creative accountancy to craft a utopian society where instead of paying tax the city actually pays you to live there. Now doesnt that just sound like a lovely offer. \n\nCities: Skylines is a modern take on the classic city simulation. The game introduces new game play elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience. the first game is currently on steam sale for 90% here and probably worth grabbing imo. https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: Pro Economist Vs Cities Skylines 2 - The Perfect NEGATIVE TAX City\n\n#gameplay #funny #citiesskylines \n\nWonderfully nonsense Terms:\nThe,Spiffing,Brit,cs2,cities skylines 2,Pro Economist Vs Cities Skylines 2,Cities 2,The Perfect Negative Tax City,City,Simulator,Management,Game,Gameplay,video game,The Spiffing Brit,money exploit,city skylines,city skyline 2,transit,urban planning,economist,city builder,cities skylines 2 gameplay,bug,exploit,spiffing brit,city planning,cities skylines gameplay,cities2,Negative Tax,Tax City,Funny,Funny Moments,Sale,Steam,Update",

The return of Minecraft Manhunt, George, Sapnap and Dream VS a real life Titan.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nGeorge:  @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nMerch: https://www.dream.shop\n\nAll video music is custom scored and produced by Dream & PmBata. \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt 2: TITAN TAKEDOWN. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, 3D cameras, and a VR headset. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. GeorgeNotFound, Sapnap and I are on a team of 3, and are trying to speedrun and beat the game before we die to the titan.\n\nIf someone dies, they cannot respawn. If I die, the challenge is over. The titan's compass points to me at all times.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. \n\nIf this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll make my next video another one :)\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MinecraftManhunt #TitanTakedown",

                "description": "3 Minecraft Speedrunners VS TITAN. You asked for it. The return of Minecraft Manhunt, George, Sapnap and Dream VS a real life Titan.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nGeorge:  @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nMerch: https://www.dream.shop\n\nAll video music is custom scored and produced by Dream & PmBata. \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt 2: TITAN TAKEDOWN. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, 3D cameras, and a VR headset. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. GeorgeNotFound, Sapnap and I are on a team of 3, and are trying to speedrun and beat the game before we die to the titan.\n\nIf someone dies, they cannot respawn. If I die, the challenge is over. The titan's compass points to me at all times.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. \n\nIf this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll make my next video another one :)\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MinecraftManhunt #TitanTakedown"

            "description": "Take your personal data back with Incogni! Use code PILOTPHOTOG at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan https://incogni.com/pilotphotog\n\nBoeing has officially secured the massive $20 billion contract for the U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter—the revolutionary F-47! In this video, we'll break down exactly what makes this sixth-generation stealth jet so groundbreaking and why Boeing's victory marks a major turning point, both for the company and America's aerospace industry as a whole.\n\nWe'll explore how Boeing overcame recent setbacks to win this critical defense contract, leveraging its extensive experience with legendary fighters like the F-15 and F/A-18, thanks in part to its historic merger with McDonnell Douglas. Plus, we'll dive into the futuristic features of the F-47, including its unique capability to fly both manned and unmanned missions, its ability to control a fleet of drone wingmen (CCAs), and why its extended range makes it ideal for operations across the vast Pacific theater.\n\nDid Boeing deserve this huge win, or was this simply a strategic choice to diversify defense contracts among Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman? And why exactly was the fighter designated \"F-47\"? Could it be a nod to President Biden, America's 47th president, or is there another hidden meaning?\n\nJoin me as we unpack this historic moment in military aviation.

In this video, we'll break down exactly what makes this sixth-generation stealth jet so groundbreaking and why Boeing's victory marks a major turning point, both for the company and America's aerospace industry as a whole.\n\nWe'll explore how Boeing overcame recent setbacks to win this critical defense contract, leveraging its extensive experience with legendary fighters like the F-15 and F/A-18, thanks in part to its historic merger with McDonnell Douglas. Plus, we'll dive into the futuristic features of the F-47, including its unique capability to fly both manned and unmanned missions, its ability to control a fleet of drone wingmen (CCAs), and why its extended range makes it ideal for operations across the vast Pacific theater.\n\nDid Boeing deserve this huge win, or was this simply a strategic choice to diversify defense contracts among Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman?

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 What is Havasupai?\n02:06 winter vs summer here\n09:00 the Secret Village explained\n10:40 Havasu Falls!!\n12:47 our private campsite\n19:27 Mooney falls\n25:06 Beaver falls\n27:28 MDS fail\n29:38 Final thoughts",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 What is Havasupai?\n02:06 winter vs summer here\n09:00 the Secret Village explained\n10:40 Havasu Falls!!\n12:47 our private campsite\n19:27 Mooney falls\n25:06 Beaver falls\n27:28 MDS fail\n29:38 Final thoughts"

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.
