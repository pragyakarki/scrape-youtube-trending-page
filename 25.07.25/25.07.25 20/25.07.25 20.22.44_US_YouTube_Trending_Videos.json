            "description": "We’re not done with you. #FNAF2movie in theaters December 5.\n\n--\n\nThey’re not just at Freddy’s anymore. \n \nIn 2023, Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

wasn’t braced and kissed my face\nWith the scope of my rifle\nI had shot it from a blind as in you’d be blind not to see\nThat there’s a man in the doorway\nOf a mother fucking mansion\nAiming at the feeder where you’d sat to take a feast\nThat’s what I said that’s what I did\nAnd it did not cut one corner\nAs I carved that fat neck mother right down to the bone\nI let him hang for several days\nAnd then I cut off hide and scriffin’\nI cut it thin then throw it in a tupperware to soak\nFried some pieces while I worked\nIt tasted like I made it\nFried in Wagner casted butter in a quiet country place\nWith albums gold and platinum\nOverflowing to the ceiling\nEatin big time is a feelin’ with the friends that I have made\nKeep my time on my Weiss\nYa goddamn right I’m flexing\nCause a thousand dollar watch is fine enough flex for me\nHave you ever got to hold and blow a thousand fucking dollars\nIt runs for 40 hours and then it winds itself to sleep\nIt’s fought for like a bitch and it’s a bitch to keep it goin’\nWhen they ain’t nobody knowin’\nAny prayer you’ve ever sang\nSee me now I’m on the sow\nAnd I’m riding to your city\nEatin big time ain’t she pretty ain’t she witty ain’t she great\nAin’t she great ain’t she grand\nIn my world she’s irreplaceable\nI’m her surfboard in the kitchen\nMy blessings come in waves\nShe’s my rebirth she’s my lemonade\nMy gravy and my biscuits\nMama I’ve been out there huntin’ Imma need you to make a plate\nShe pets my head and whispers “You poor thing you must be famished”\nI just knew that this would happen I got all the fixins made\nI’ll get tick full ‘fore I ever pull myself off of this table\nEatin big time ain’t she pretty just rollin’ in the shade\nEatin big time in the holler ain’t it lovely ain’t it

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

A bit\n불을 비춰 다 비켜, 네 앞길을 뺏겨\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Mira & Rumi]\nKnocking you out like a lullaby\nHear that sound ringing in your mind\nBetter sit down for the show\n'Cause I'm gonna show you how it's done, done, done\n\n[Chorus: All]\n(Hey) Huntrix don't miss\nHow it's done, done, done\n(Hey) Huntrix don't quit\nHow it's done, done, done\n\n[Post-Chorus: All]\nRun, run, we run the town\nWhole world playin' our sound\nTurnin' up, it's goin' down\nHuntrix show this, how it's done, done, done\n\n[Verse 2: Rumi, Mira & Zoey]\nYeah, something about when you come for the crown\nThat's so humbling, huh?\n갑자기 왜 그래? 먼저 건드려, 왜?\n이제야 포기해, what?\nNothing to us, run up, you're done up, we come up\nFrom sunup to sundown, so come out to play\nWon either way, we're one in a million\nWe killin', we bring it, you want it? Okay\nHeels, nails, blade, mascara\nFit check for my napalm era\nNeed to beat my face, make it cute and savage\nMirror, mirror on my phone, who's the baddest? (Us, hello?)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Rumi, Mira & Zoey]\nKnocking you out like a lullaby\nHear that sound ringing in your mind\nBetter sit down for the show\n'Cause I'm gonna show you (I'm gonna show you)\n(I'm gonna show you) How it's done, done, done\n[Verse 3: Mira, All & Zoey]\nI don't talk, but I bite, full of venom (Uh)\nSpittin' facts, you know that's\nHow it's done, done, done\nOkay, like, I know I ramble\nBut when shootin' my words, I go Rambo\nTook blood, sweat, and tears, to look natural (Uh)\nThat's how it's done, done, done\n\n[Bridge: Rumi & All]\nHear our voice unwavering\n'Til our song defeats the night\nMakin' fear afraid to breathe\n'Til the dark meets the light (How it's done, done, done)\n\n[Chorus: Mira, Rumi, All & Zoey]\nRun, run, we run the town (Done, done, done)\nWhole world playin' our sound (Done, done, done)\nTurnin' up, it's going down (Done, done, done)\nHuntrix, show this how it's done, done, done\n\n[Outro: Rumi & Mira, All & Zoey]\nWe hunt you down, down, down (Down)\n(Done, done, done)\nWe got you now, now, now (Got you now)\n(Done, done, done)\nWe show you how, how, how (Show you how)\nHuntrix, don't miss, how it's done, done, done\n\nTags\nHuntrix, How It's Done, Huntrix How It's Done, How It's Done Huntrix, Lyrics, Lyrics How It's Done, Huntrix How It's Done Lyrics, How It's Done Huntrix Lyrics, Huntrix Lyrics, K-Pop Demon Hunters, How It's Done Lyrics Huntrix, Lyrics Huntrix How It's Done, Lyrics How It's Done Huntrix, kpop demon hunters netflix, kpop demon hunters songs, huntrix how it's done kpop demon hunters, kpop demon hunters soundtrack",

A bit\n불을 비춰 다 비켜, 네 앞길을 뺏겨\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Mira & Rumi]\nKnocking you out like a lullaby\nHear that sound ringing in your mind\nBetter sit down for the show\n'Cause I'm gonna show you how it's done, done, done\n\n[Chorus: All]\n(Hey) Huntrix don't miss\nHow it's done, done, done\n(Hey) Huntrix don't quit\nHow it's done, done, done\n\n[Post-Chorus: All]\nRun, run, we run the town\nWhole world playin' our sound\nTurnin' up, it's goin' down\nHuntrix show this, how it's done, done, done\n\n[Verse 2: Rumi, Mira & Zoey]\nYeah, something about when you come for the crown\nThat's so humbling, huh?\n갑자기 왜 그래? 먼저 건드려, 왜?\n이제야 포기해, what?\nNothing to us, run up, you're done up, we come up\nFrom sunup to sundown, so come out to play\nWon either way, we're one in a million\nWe killin', we bring it, you want it? Okay\nHeels, nails, blade, mascara\nFit check for my napalm era\nNeed to beat my face, make it cute and savage\nMirror, mirror on my phone, who's the baddest? (Us, hello?)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Rumi, Mira & Zoey]\nKnocking you out like a lullaby\nHear that sound ringing in your mind\nBetter sit down for the show\n'Cause I'm gonna show you (I'm gonna show you)\n(I'm gonna show you) How it's done, done, done\n[Verse 3: Mira, All & Zoey]\nI don't talk, but I bite, full of venom (Uh)\nSpittin' facts, you know that's\nHow it's done, done, done\nOkay, like, I know I ramble\nBut when shootin' my words, I go Rambo\nTook blood, sweat, and tears, to look natural (Uh)\nThat's how it's done, done, done\n\n[Bridge: Rumi & All]\nHear our voice unwavering\n'Til our song defeats the night\nMakin' fear afraid to breathe\n'Til the dark meets the light (How it's done, done, done)\n\n[Chorus: Mira, Rumi, All & Zoey]\nRun, run, we run the town (Done, done, done)\nWhole world playin' our sound (Done, done, done)\nTurnin' up, it's going down (Done, done, done)\nHuntrix, show this how it's done, done, done\n\n[Outro: Rumi & Mira, All & Zoey]\nWe hunt you down, down, down (Down)\n(Done, done, done)\nWe got you now, now, now (Got you now)\n(Done, done, done)\nWe show you how, how, how (Show you how)\nHuntrix, don't miss, how it's done, done, done\n\nTags\nHuntrix, How It's Done, Huntrix How It's Done, How It's Done Huntrix, Lyrics, Lyrics How It's Done, Huntrix How It's Done Lyrics, How It's Done Huntrix Lyrics, Huntrix Lyrics, K-Pop Demon Hunters, How It's Done Lyrics Huntrix, Lyrics Huntrix How It's Done, Lyrics How It's Done Huntrix, kpop demon hunters netflix, kpop demon hunters songs, huntrix how it's done kpop demon hunters, kpop demon hunters soundtrack"

Kini, sebagai versi Jack dan Rose yang lebih tua—atau mungkin anak-anak mereka—mereka mengarungi cinta, kehilangan, dan takdir di bawah bayang-bayang kapal legendaris tersebut.\n\nBerlatar belakang pemandangan laut yang memukau dan reuni yang mengharukan, Titanic 2 mengeksplorasi gema masa lalu dan ikatan yang melampaui waktu. Nantikan romansa yang memukau, visual yang menghantui, dan perjalanan antara kenangan dan harapan.\n\n⚠️ Penafian:\nIni adalah trailer konsep buatan penggemar yang dibuat hanya untuk hiburan dan spekulasi. Trailer ini tidak berafiliasi dengan 20th Century Studios, James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, atau produksi resmi mana pun. Semua hak cipta dimiliki oleh pemiliknya masing-masing.\n\nSelain trailer buatan penggemar, saya juga berbagi ulasan film, berita, dan informasi terbaru dari dunia hiburan.

Determined to restore Carthage’s glory, he took command of its army at age 26 and led a daring invasion of Italy from Iberia, famously crossing the Alps with his army and 37 war elephants. Hannibal secured major victories at Trebia and Lake Trasimene, with his most famous success at the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C., where he employed a masterful double envelopment to crush a much larger Roman force – a tactic that’s still studied in military strategy today.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\n\nLyric video created by: Bonez Studios \n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.\n\n#Sabaton #Legends #LightningAtTheGates",

Determined to restore Carthage’s glory, he took command of its army at age 26 and led a daring invasion of Italy from Iberia, famously crossing the Alps with his army and 37 war elephants. Hannibal secured major victories at Trebia and Lake Trasimene, with his most famous success at the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C., where he employed a masterful double envelopment to crush a much larger Roman force – a tactic that’s still studied in military strategy today.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\n\nLyric video created by: Bonez Studios \n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.\n\n#Sabaton #Legends #LightningAtTheGates"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Akon\n\n[Intro: T-Pain]\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: T-Pain]\nBroke up with my girl last night so I went to the club (So I went to the club)\nPut on a fresh white suit and the mini-coupe sittin' on dubs (Sittin' on dubs)\nI'm just lookin' for somebody to talk to and show me some love (Show me some love)\nIf you know what I mean, uh-huh\nEverybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)\nTwo hundred bi***es in the building, ain't none of them hot (Ain't none of them hot)\nExcept for this pretty young thang that was workin' on the way, at the top (On the way, at the top)\nShawty, what is your name?\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd I think she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe hit it off somethin' proper like\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 2: T-Pain]\nGot a brand new girl so I'm feelin' all good inside (All good inside)\nFeel like I put some brand new twenty-fours on a brand new ride (On a brand new ride)\nTriple shot of Patron on the rocks with a little bit of lime (With a little bit of lime)\nI'm just keepin' it real, uh-huh\nBaby still workin' at the club so I'm gettin' in free (So I'm gettin' in free)\nWednesday night, I'm on the list, T-Pain plus three (T-Pain plus three)\nEvery time I hit the spot babygirl takin' care of me (Takin' care of me)\nHow do you think I feel?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 3: Akon & T-Pain]\nShorty, I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out (Ever come out)\n'Less I'm in the M6, doin' tricks, freeway burnt out (Freeway burnt out)\nGot a passenger side that's empty wantin' it to be your spot (Be your stop)\nPut you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top (And I end up on top)\nDon't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby (Baby)\nJust lookin' at you from a distance, lookin' like a goddamn star baby (Baby)\nSo my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car? (Those keys to the car)\n'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorrow (I'll see you tomorrow)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Akon]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know, she thinks I'm cool (She thinks I'm cool)\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back (Uh-huh)\nAnd then I think that (Uh-huh)\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight (Oh, yeah, slide)\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\nTags\nbartender,bartender lyrics,lyrics bartender,t pain,akon,lyrics,t pain bartender,bartender t pain,t pain bartender lyrics,lyrics t pain bartender,t pain lyrics,lyrics t pain,t pain lyrics bartender,bartender t pain lyrics,akon bartender,bartender akon,akon bartender lyrics,lyrics akon bartender,akon lyrics,lyrics bartender akon,bartender akon lyrics,t pain akon bartender,t pain akon bartender lyrics,I like the bartender,I'm at the bar with her,music,rap\n\n#tpain #bartender #akon #lyrics"

                "description": "Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's open world allows you to roam freely throughout the region... But how far can you take that idea? With the inclusion of the DLCs, I went on a journey to catch every Pokemon available before the first badge in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and this is how it went. This video took a lot of time and effort to put together, so I'd really appreciate it if you shared this with a friend. If you have any suggestions for the next video, leave it in the comments below!
