            "description": "We’re not done with you. #FNAF2movie in theaters December 5.\n\n--\n\nThey’re not just at Freddy’s anymore. \n \nIn 2023, Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

feeder where you’d sat to take a feast\nThat’s what I said that’s what I did\nAnd it did not cut one corner\nAs I carved that fat neck mother right down to the bone\nI let him hang for several days\nAnd then I cut off hide and scriffin’\nI cut it thin then throw it in a tupperware to soak\nFried some pieces while I worked\nIt tasted like I made it\nFried in Wagner casted butter in a quiet country place\nWith albums gold and platinum\nOverflowing to the ceiling\nEatin big time is a feelin’ with the friends that I have made\nKeep my time on my Weiss\nYa goddamn right I’m flexing\nCause a thousand dollar watch is fine enough flex for me\nHave you ever got to hold and blow a thousand fucking dollars\nIt runs for 40 hours and then it winds itself to sleep\nIt’s fought for like a bitch and it’s a bitch to keep it goin’\nWhen they ain’t nobody knowin’\nAny prayer you’ve ever sang\nSee me now I’m on the sow\nAnd I’m riding to your city\nEatin big time ain’t she pretty ain’t she witty ain’t she great\nAin’t she great ain’t she grand\nIn my world she’s irreplaceable\nI’m her surfboard in the kitchen\nMy blessings come in waves\nShe’s my rebirth she’s my lemonade\nMy gravy and my biscuits\nMama I’ve been out there huntin’ Imma need you to make a plate\nShe pets my head and whispers “You poor thing you must be famished”\nI just knew that this would happen I got all the fixins made\nI’ll get tick full ‘fore I ever pull myself off of this table\nEatin big time ain’t she pretty just rollin’ in the shade\nEatin big time in the holler ain’t it lovely ain’t it

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

A bit\n불을 비춰 다 비켜, 네 앞길을 뺏겨\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Mira & Rumi]\nKnocking you out like a lullaby\nHear that sound ringing in your mind\nBetter sit down for the show\n'Cause I'm gonna show you how it's done, done, done\n\n[Chorus: All]\n(Hey) Huntrix don't miss\nHow it's done, done, done\n(Hey) Huntrix don't quit\nHow it's done, done, done\n\n[Post-Chorus: All]\nRun, run, we run the town\nWhole world playin' our sound\nTurnin' up, it's goin' down\nHuntrix show this, how it's done, done, done\n\n[Verse 2: Rumi, Mira & Zoey]\nYeah, something about when you come for the crown\nThat's so humbling, huh?\n갑자기 왜 그래? 먼저 건드려, 왜?\n이제야 포기해, what?\nNothing to us, run up, you're done up, we come up\nFrom sunup to sundown, so come out to play\nWon either way, we're one in a million\nWe killin', we bring it, you want it? Okay\nHeels, nails, blade, mascara\nFit check for my napalm era\nNeed to beat my face, make it cute and savage\nMirror, mirror on my phone, who's the baddest?

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Akon\n\n[Intro: T-Pain]\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: T-Pain]\nBroke up with my girl last night so I went to the club (So I went to the club)\nPut on a fresh white suit and the mini-coupe sittin' on dubs (Sittin' on dubs)\nI'm just lookin' for somebody to talk to and show me some love (Show me some love)\nIf you know what I mean, uh-huh\nEverybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)\nTwo hundred bi***es in the building, ain't none of them hot (Ain't none of them hot)\nExcept for this pretty young thang that was workin' on the way, at the top (On the way, at the top)\nShawty, what is your name?\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd I think she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe hit it off somethin' proper like\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 2: T-Pain]\nGot a brand new girl so I'm feelin' all good inside (All good inside)\nFeel like I put some brand new twenty-fours on a brand new ride (On a brand new ride)\nTriple shot of Patron on the rocks with a little bit of lime (With a little bit of lime)\nI'm just keepin' it real, uh-huh\nBaby still workin' at the club so I'm gettin' in free (So I'm gettin' in free)\nWednesday night, I'm on the list, T-Pain plus three (T-Pain plus three)\nEvery time I hit the spot babygirl takin' care of me (Takin' care of me)\nHow do you think I feel?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 3: Akon & T-Pain]\nShorty, I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out (Ever come out)\n'Less I'm in the M6, doin' tricks, freeway burnt out (Freeway burnt out)\nGot a passenger side that's empty wantin' it to be your spot (Be your stop)\nPut you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top (And I end up on top)\nDon't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby (Baby)\nJust lookin' at you from a distance, lookin' like a goddamn star baby (Baby)\nSo my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car? (Those keys to the car)\n'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorrow (I'll see you tomorrow)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Akon]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know, she thinks I'm cool (She thinks I'm cool)\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back (Uh-huh)\nAnd then I think that (Uh-huh)\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight (Oh, yeah, slide)\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\nTags\nbartender,bartender lyrics,lyrics bartender,t pain,akon,lyrics,t pain bartender,bartender t pain,t pain bartender lyrics,lyrics t pain bartender,t pain lyrics,lyrics t pain,t pain lyrics bartender,bartender t pain lyrics,akon bartender,bartender akon,akon bartender lyrics,lyrics akon bartender,akon lyrics,lyrics bartender akon,bartender akon lyrics,t pain akon bartender,t pain akon bartender lyrics,I like the bartender,I'm at the bar with her,music,rap\n\n#tpain #bartender #akon #lyrics",

Akon\n\n[Intro: T-Pain]\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: T-Pain]\nBroke up with my girl last night so I went to the club (So I went to the club)\nPut on a fresh white suit and the mini-coupe sittin' on dubs (Sittin' on dubs)\nI'm just lookin' for somebody to talk to and show me some love (Show me some love)\nIf you know what I mean, uh-huh\nEverybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)\nTwo hundred bi***es in the building, ain't none of them hot (Ain't none of them hot)\nExcept for this pretty young thang that was workin' on the way, at the top (On the way, at the top)\nShawty, what is your name?\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd I think she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe hit it off somethin' proper like\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 2: T-Pain]\nGot a brand new girl so I'm feelin' all good inside (All good inside)\nFeel like I put some brand new twenty-fours on a brand new ride (On a brand new ride)\nTriple shot of Patron on the rocks with a little bit of lime (With a little bit of lime)\nI'm just keepin' it real, uh-huh\nBaby still workin' at the club so I'm gettin' in free (So I'm gettin' in free)\nWednesday night, I'm on the list, T-Pain plus three (T-Pain plus three)\nEvery time I hit the spot babygirl takin' care of me (Takin' care of me)\nHow do you think I feel?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 3: Akon & T-Pain]\nShorty, I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out (Ever come out)\n'Less I'm in the M6, doin' tricks, freeway burnt out (Freeway burnt out)\nGot a passenger side that's empty wantin' it to be your spot (Be your stop)\nPut you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top (And I end up on top)\nDon't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby (Baby)\nJust lookin' at you from a distance, lookin' like a goddamn star baby (Baby)\nSo my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car? (Those keys to the car)\n'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorrow (I'll see you tomorrow)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Akon]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know, she thinks I'm cool (She thinks I'm cool)\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back (Uh-huh)\nAnd then I think that (Uh-huh)\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight (Oh, yeah, slide)\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\nTags\nbartender,bartender lyrics,lyrics bartender,t pain,akon,lyrics,t pain bartender,bartender t pain,t pain bartender lyrics,lyrics t pain bartender,t pain lyrics,lyrics t pain,t pain lyrics bartender,bartender t pain lyrics,akon bartender,bartender akon,akon bartender lyrics,lyrics akon bartender,akon lyrics,lyrics bartender akon,bartender akon lyrics,t pain akon bartender,t pain akon bartender lyrics,I like the bartender,I'm at the bar with her,music,rap\n\n#tpain #bartender #akon #lyrics"

While Vaani writes, Krish sings and they both make music together. Though poles apart in their lives, beliefs and backgrounds, Vaani and Krish are perfect with each other and for each other. Will they understand that truth despite their age, their problems? \n\nThey say flawed, imperfect people make for a perfect love story…and Saiyaara is about celebrating that one love story that is so deep, so pure and so caring that it is absolutely unconditional.\n\nVaani and Krish will have to navigate life, their problems, their insecurities to hopefully realise that only love can be the answer to everything. Saiyaara is a film that celebrates every season of love through the eyes of Vaani & Krish and poses a simple question…do you love someone so much that you would bet everything to keep that person in your life?\n\n#yrfnewreleases #yrf #yashrajfilms #yrfmovies #yrfmusic #mohitsuri #akshayewidhani #ahaanpanday #aneetpadda #mithoon #arijitsingh #arijitsinghsongs #dhun #dhunsong #newsong #bollywoodsongs #hindiromanticsong #newmusichindi #dhunlyrical\n\n© Yash Raj Films Pvt.
