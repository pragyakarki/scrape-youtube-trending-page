            "description": "We’re not done with you. #FNAF2movie in theaters December 5.\n\n--\n\nThey’re not just at Freddy’s anymore. \n \nIn 2023, Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Expect sweeping romance, haunting visuals, and a journey between memory and hope.\n\n⚠️ Disclaimer:\nThis is a fan-made concept trailer created for entertainment and speculation only.

It was also confirmed today that Battlefield 6 will NOT release on last-gen consoles, which means BF6 will only release on PS5, Xbox Series X and PC.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

A bit\n불을 비춰 다 비켜, 네 앞길을 뺏겨\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Mira & Rumi]\nKnocking you out like a lullaby\nHear that sound ringing in your mind\nBetter sit down for the show\n'Cause I'm gonna show you how it's done, done, done\n\n[Chorus: All]\n(Hey) Huntrix don't miss\nHow it's done, done, done\n(Hey) Huntrix don't quit\nHow it's done, done, done\n\n[Post-Chorus: All]\nRun, run, we run the town\nWhole world playin' our sound\nTurnin' up, it's goin' down\nHuntrix show this, how it's done, done, done\n\n[Verse 2: Rumi, Mira & Zoey]\nYeah, something about when you come for the crown\nThat's so humbling, huh?\n갑자기 왜 그래? 먼저 건드려, 왜?\n이제야 포기해, what?\nNothing to us, run up, you're done up, we come up\nFrom sunup to sundown, so come out to play\nWon either way, we're one in a million\nWe killin', we bring it, you want it? Okay\nHeels, nails, blade, mascara\nFit check for my napalm era\nNeed to beat my face, make it cute and savage\nMirror, mirror on my phone, who's the baddest? (Us, hello?)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Rumi, Mira & Zoey]\nKnocking you out like a lullaby\nHear that sound ringing in your mind\nBetter sit down for the show\n'Cause I'm gonna show you (I'm gonna show you)\n(I'm gonna show you) How it's done, done, done\n[Verse 3: Mira, All & Zoey]\nI don't talk, but I bite, full of venom (Uh)\nSpittin' facts, you know that's\nHow it's done, done, done\nOkay, like, I know I ramble\nBut when shootin' my words, I go Rambo\nTook blood, sweat, and tears, to look natural (Uh)\nThat's how it's done, done, done\n\n[Bridge: Rumi & All]\nHear our voice unwavering\n'Til our song defeats the night\nMakin' fear afraid to breathe\n'Til the dark meets the light (How it's done, done, done)\n\n[Chorus: Mira, Rumi, All & Zoey]\nRun, run, we run the town (Done, done, done)\nWhole world playin' our sound (Done, done, done)\nTurnin' up, it's going down (Done, done, done)\nHuntrix, show this how it's done, done, done\n\n[Outro: Rumi & Mira, All & Zoey]\nWe hunt you down, down, down (Down)\n(Done, done, done)\nWe got you now, now, now (Got you now)\n(Done, done, done)\nWe show you how, how, how (Show you how)\nHuntrix, don't miss, how it's done, done, done\n\nTags\nHuntrix, How It's Done, Huntrix How It's Done, How It's Done Huntrix, Lyrics, Lyrics How It's Done, Huntrix How It's Done Lyrics, How It's Done Huntrix Lyrics, Huntrix Lyrics, K-Pop Demon Hunters, How It's Done Lyrics Huntrix, Lyrics Huntrix How It's Done, Lyrics How It's Done Huntrix, kpop demon hunters netflix, kpop demon hunters songs, huntrix how it's done kpop demon hunters, kpop demon hunters soundtrack"

Determined to restore Carthage’s glory, he took command of its army at age 26 and led a daring invasion of Italy from Iberia, famously crossing the Alps with his army and 37 war elephants. Hannibal secured major victories at Trebia and Lake Trasimene, with his most famous success at the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C., where he employed a masterful double envelopment to crush a much larger Roman force – a tactic that’s still studied in military strategy today.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\n\nLyric video created by: Bonez Studios \n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.\n\n#Sabaton #Legends #LightningAtTheGates",

Determined to restore Carthage’s glory, he took command of its army at age 26 and led a daring invasion of Italy from Iberia, famously crossing the Alps with his army and 37 war elephants. Hannibal secured major victories at Trebia and Lake Trasimene, with his most famous success at the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C., where he employed a masterful double envelopment to crush a much larger Roman force – a tactic that’s still studied in military strategy today.\n\n==================================\nRecorded, mixed and mastered at Black Lounge studios by Jonas Kjellgren.\n\nLyric video created by: Bonez Studios \n==================================\nSabaton is a registered and protected trademark.\n\n#Sabaton #Legends #LightningAtTheGates"
