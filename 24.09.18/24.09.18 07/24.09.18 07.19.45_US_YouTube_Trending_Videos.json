            "description": "Dog Man - In Theaters January 31\n\nPart dog, part man, all hero. \n\nFrom DreamWorks Animation—creators of the beloved blockbuster franchises Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and The Boss Baby—comes the canine-crime-fighting film adaptation of Dav Pilkey’s New York Times bestselling literary phenomenon: Dog Man. \n\nWhen a faithful police dog and his human police officer owner are injured together on the job, a harebrained but life-saving surgery fuses the two of them together and Dog Man is born. Dog Man is sworn to protect and serve—and fetch, sit and roll over.  \n\nAs Dog Man embraces his new identity and strives to impress his Chief (Lil Rel Howery, Get Out, Free Guy), he must stop the pretty evil plots of feline supervillain Petey the Cat (Pete Davidson; Saturday Night Live, The King of Staten Island). Petey’s latest plan is to clone himself, creating the kitten Lil Petey, to double his ability to do crime stuff. Things get complicated, though, when Lil Petey forges an unexpected bond with Dog Man. \n\nWhen Lil Petey falls into the clutches of a common enemy, Dog Man and Petey reluctantly join forces in an action-packed race against time to rescue the young kitten. In the process, they discover the power of family (and kittens!) to bring even the most hostile foes together.  \n\nDog Man also stars Isla Fisher (Wedding Crashers, Rango) as TV reporter Sarah Hatoff; Poppy Liu (Hacks, The Afterparty) as Petey’s assistant, Butler; Emmy nominee Stephen Root (Barry, King of the Hill) as Grampa; Billy Boyd (the Lord of the Rings franchise, Seed of Chucky) as Sarah’s cameraman, Seamus; and Emmy and Golden Globe winner Ricky Gervais (The Office, Extras) as Flippy the fish.  \n\nDog Man is directed by Emmy winner Peter Hastings (The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants, Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness), whose credits include the groundbreaking animated series Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain. The film is produced by Karen Foster (Spirit Untamed), who served as co-producer on DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon. \n\nLaunched in 2016 by Dav Pilkey—the #1 global bestselling author and award-winning illustrator of the Captain Underpants books—the Dog Man Scholastic series now includes 12 books. The series has more than 60 million copies in print and has been translated into 47 languages. Cat Kid Comic Club, a spin-off of Dog Man launched in 2020, has also topped bestseller lists around the world. The most recent Dog Man book, Dog Man: Twenty Thousand Fleas Under the Sea, was overall the #1 bestselling children’s book in the U.S. in 2023, across all children’s formats and ages. Pilkey’s newest book in the Dog Man Series, Dog Man: Big Jim Begins, is set to release on December 3, 2024.\n\nDreamWorks Animation’s Dog Man will be distributed by Universal Pictures.\n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: www.Facebook.com/DreamWorksDogMan \nInstagram: www.Instagram.com/dreamworksdogman \nX: www.x.com/dreamworks  \nTikTok: www.TikTok.com/@DreamWorks\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nOfficial Site: www.dreamworksdogman.com\n#DogManMovie",

            "description": "Mexican superstar and pound-for-pound great Canelo Álvarez delivered another virtuoso performance by dropping the previously unbeaten Edgar Berlanga on his way to defending his unified WBC, WBA and WBO Super Middleweight World Championships via unanimous decision as Canelo Promotions presented a Mexican Independence Day Weekend extravaganza headlining a PBC Pay-Per-View available on Prime Video Saturday night from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n \n\"I did good. Now what are they gonna say? They said I don't fight young fighters. They always talk, but I'm the best fighter in the world,” said Canelo.\n \nIn the latest edition of the historic boxing rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico, Canelo (62-2-2, 39 KOs) sent his legion of fans into a frenzy early as he connected on a perfect left hook midway through round three that sent Berlanga (22-1, 17 KOs) to the mat. Berlanga was able to make it through the round and tried to impose his physicality on Canelo, with the two getting tied up, trading low blows and nearly hitting the canvas in a tense moment during round five.\n \n\"I got a little angry with his tactics, but I'm Mexican man,” said Canelo. “It means a lot to fight on this day. It's an honor to represent my country on this day.”\n \n\"I'm upset because at the end of the day I'm a winner,” said Berlanga. “I fought a legend tonight and did my best to represent Puerto Rico. We're fighters and we try to throw our opponent off their game. I took his best shot and I knew I could take his punches and return them. I could have jabbed a lot more, but I was in there with a legend.”\n \nUsing the ring generalship that’s made him a future Hall of Famer, Canelo continued to control the action, turning up the heat in the later rounds, landing 16 power shots in round eight and 20 in round ten, according to CompuBox. The punch stats reflected Canelo’s dominance throughout the 12 rounds, as he out landed Berlanga 201 to 119.\n \n\"My experience and my talent was the difference,” said Canelo. “It's about hard work and intelligence. It's everything together. If you have talent, you need discipline as well.”\n \nBerlanga remained game throughout, continuing to throw punches and look for openings, even as Canelo broke him down with his varied attack. In the end, Canelo’s 49% connect rate on power punches buoyed him to victory by scores of 118-109 twice and 117-110.\n \n\"A lot of people say we can't, but we can,” said Canelo “Las Vegas is like a second home for Mexicans. We are warriors and we never give up. I’m going to rest and then I'm going to decide what's next.\"\n\n#CaneloBerlanga #Canelo #Berlanga\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

Let's just say it was a series of unfortunate events for all of us.\n\nAs you can imagine, everyone at HH feels TERRIBLE about the whole situation.  They have assured us that they stand behind their product and their customers. \n\nThe Cebu factory now has new management, new systems in place, additional experts, new training programs and has undergone infrastructure changes.  Just before we left, we were able to meet Rudy, the new general manager.  He is an impressive fellow with 24 years in design and manufacturing in the marine, automotive, aerospace and defense industries. He shared some of his grand plans for the Cebu factory and I do believe him when he says all future work will be up to the high standards HH is known for.\n\nSo, while it has been a very stressful and expensive five plus weeks of living out of hotels.  We are happy to be back in our home and preparing for our next big passage.  Plus, we get to share the journey with some of you, our Curiosity Crew!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWE’RE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of explorers, modern-day documentarians, and cultivators of curiosity.\n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nThings We're Most Curious About...\n\nGETTING OFF-GRID \nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  So self-reliance and sustainable living are a must.  We've learned heaps about renewable energy, managing waste, creating safe drinking water and foraging for food.  We carefully manage our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nTALKING TO STRANGERS\nPeople are busy (even on remote islands) and travelers are a dime a dozen.  It takes time to talk to strangers, and even more time to have a real connection.  Going the extra mile to get to know someone is a commitment. \n\nWhich is why these are our most treasured experiences.  Setting off into the world with curiosity as our guide and nature as our compass.  We talk to strangers and accept hospitality without fear or reservations.  Both giving and receiving.\n\nALTERNATIVE LIVING\nThese are people who are doing things differently. Forgoing the mainstream, seeking freedom and living on the margins. Creative, unique and inspiring people who challenge our ideas of home and community.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Teething Issues & Warranty Work \n02:53 Day 35 Return to the Boatyard \n04:35 Day 37 Splash Day \n06:57 Sea Trial \n09:56 Hits and Misses from Warranty Repairs\n13:34 Stray Current Running Through the Boat\n16:17 Solar Panel Issues\n17:58 Main Sail Issues\n20:23 Slow Motoring Speeds\n21:10 Refrigerator Issues\n22:14 Add Anti-Foul to Transom\n23:00 Drainage Issues\n24:26 Other Warranty Issues\n25:28 New Crew Coming\n26:25 Rigging Issue \n27:19 The New Crew\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #Sailboat #Travel #LifeStyle \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2024",

Let's just say it was a series of unfortunate events for all of us.\n\nAs you can imagine, everyone at HH feels TERRIBLE about the whole situation.  They have assured us that they stand behind their product and their customers. \n\nThe Cebu factory now has new management, new systems in place, additional experts, new training programs and has undergone infrastructure changes.  Just before we left, we were able to meet Rudy, the new general manager.  He is an impressive fellow with 24 years in design and manufacturing in the marine, automotive, aerospace and defense industries. He shared some of his grand plans for the Cebu factory and I do believe him when he says all future work will be up to the high standards HH is known for.\n\nSo, while it has been a very stressful and expensive five plus weeks of living out of hotels.  We are happy to be back in our home and preparing for our next big passage.

A couple of explorers, modern-day documentarians, and cultivators of curiosity.\n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nThings We're Most Curious About...\n\nGETTING OFF-GRID \nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  So self-reliance and sustainable living are a must.  We've learned heaps about renewable energy, managing waste, creating safe drinking water and foraging for food.  We carefully manage our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nTALKING TO STRANGERS\nPeople are busy (even on remote islands) and travelers are a dime a dozen.  It takes time to talk to strangers, and even more time to have a real connection.  Going the extra mile to get to know someone is a commitment. \n\nWhich is why these are our most treasured experiences.  Setting off into the world with curiosity as our guide and nature as our compass.  We talk to strangers and accept hospitality without fear or reservations.  Both giving and receiving.\n\nALTERNATIVE LIVING\nThese are people who are doing things differently. Forgoing the mainstream, seeking freedom and living on the margins. Creative, unique and inspiring people who challenge our ideas of home and community.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Teething Issues & Warranty Work \n02:53 Day 35 Return to the Boatyard \n04:35 Day 37 Splash Day \n06:57 Sea Trial \n09:56 Hits and Misses from Warranty Repairs\n13:34 Stray Current Running Through the Boat\n16:17 Solar Panel Issues\n17:58 Main Sail Issues\n20:23 Slow Motoring Speeds\n21:10 Refrigerator Issues\n22:14 Add Anti-Foul to Transom\n23:00 Drainage Issues\n24:26 Other Warranty Issues\n25:28 New Crew Coming\n26:25 Rigging Issue \n27:19 The New Crew\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #Sailboat #Travel #LifeStyle \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2024"

But can they find the seal?\n\n------------\n\n\nFollow the show at http://www.twitter.com/taskmaster\nBecome a fan at https://www.facebook.com/officialtaskmaster\nBuy Taskmaster merch: https://taskmasterstore.com/\n\n------------\n\nIn this Broadcast Award-winning, BAFTA and Emmy Award-nominated entertainment show, Taskmaster tyrant Greg Davies (Man Down, Cuckoo), with the help of his loyal assistant Alex Horne (The Horne Section and the show’s creator), sets out to test the wiles, wit and wisdom of five hyper-competitive comedians.\n\nComedians that have risked life, limb, and dignity in the hope of making the Taskmaster proud so far include: Frank Skinner (The Frank Skinner Show), Mel Giedroyc (The Great British Bake Off), Romesh Ranganathan (Asian Provocateur), Hugh Dennis (Outnumbered), Sally Phillips (Bridget Jones’ Diary), Rose Matafeo (Edinburgh Comedy Award Winner 2018), and Russell Howard (The Russell Howard Hour). Unaware of what awaits them in each wax-sealed envelope, only one competitor can become the victorious owner of His Royal Task-ness’ golden head and be crowned the next Taskmaster Champion.\n\n#Taskmaster #Comedy #GregDavies #AlexHorne"

            "description": "A thank you side project that could potentially turn into something even bigger. Dive in with us as we go through the process of taking the Leroy body down to 1/16 scale, and creating a prototype RC body to fit the 1970 Chevy Chevelle mini no prep drag car by Losi from Horizon Hobby. Through 3d scanning using Creaform, 3d printing and some random materials, we finish the Leroy Replica RC Body. We then take it to the Freedom Factory to present it to @CleetusM  to get his thoughts. We're thrilled about not only the Leroy Body making a debut soon, but also excited to see where things go with the RC Body. Hope you enjoy the video. Thanks for your support!
