The title song ‘JUMP’ is a dance music of alternative pop genre with hip-hop based sound. A free and dynamic performance captures P1Harmony’s message to “JUMP” higher together while enjoying the feelings at the moment rather than worrying and hesitating.\n\nIn addition to the title track, ‘JUMP’, a total of six tracks are included in this album: a hip-hop track with an impressive piano riff, ‘Love Me For Me,’ ‘New Classic’ featuring a hip-hop-like synth sound and 808 bass riff, ‘More Than Words,’ with a dreamy synth sound and colorful vocals, a pop dance song, ‘Heartbeat Drum,’ and ‘I Am You,’ a slow-tempo R&B song.\n \nThe last in the 'HARMONY' series, P1Harmony has completed the perfect world with the 6th Mini Album.

                "description": "I just got a 45-minute hands-on session with the new Apple Vision Pro and visionOS.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of Hanssen's death and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\r\n\r\nHe had been serving a sentence of life in prison without parole after pleading guilty to 15 counts of espionage and other charges in 2001.\r\n\r\nFull story: https://www.9news.com/article/news/nation-world/robert-hanssen-fbi-agent-russian-spy-dies-in-colorado-prison/507-32eccb9f-5020-4db5-bc28-53ea80bd9332\r\n\r\nMore local videos here: https://bit.ly/2Pa0d1l  \r\nSubscribe to NEXT: http://bit.ly/2eP1GwI  \r\nStay connected: 9NEWS Website: http://www.9news.com/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ilike9news  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/9NEWS  \r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/9newsdenver/  \r\n \r\nDownload the 9NEWS App: https://www.9news.com/appredirect/  \r\nSign up for the 9NEWSLETTER: https://www.9news.com/email  \r\n \r\n9NEWS (KUSA) is located in Denver, Colorado.",

                "description": "In the final episode of this series, I'm at the legendary Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas, Nevada trying to get the better of their infamous Octuple Bypass Burger...\n\nNow this one isn't technically a food challenge, in that you don't get anything for winning, other than 20,000 calories in your belly, a high five and a bit of prestige...but it is without doubt the most requested video in the eight year history of the channel...and in truth not many people have ever managed to get the better of it...so I couldn't leave without giving it a bash!\n\nI also got one of their 2,000 calorie butterfat shakes, an IV bag full of wine and a vodka jello shot that you have to throat like a warrior...just for good measure...\n\nFOLLOW ME: @BeardMeatsFood\n\nWATCH THE PODCAST: https://www.youtube.com/breakingbreadpodcast\n\nFOLLOW THE PODCAST: @BreakingBreadPD\n\nMERCHANDISE DISTRIBUTED BY SPRING: \n\nUse the merchandise shelf below the video player or the following link - https://bit.ly/3S7VPjP\n\n#FoodChallenge #LasVegas #HeartAttackGrill"

To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home.

With our never-ending renovations, improvements and gardening we've been doing this spring, we've decided to give our tired and sore backs some help by tag-teaming in a legend in the world of gardening: THE TRACTOR! A 2012 Kubota B26, bright orange tractor with 1800 hours on it to be precise 🤠 That's right, through a twist of fate and a bit of good fortune, we were able to get one recently and it's beautiful. And we need YOUR help in naming it! Please comment your names below! 👇 But first we have to learn how to drive it, use the bucket, backhoe and forklift. This thing turns on a dime, lifts giant payloads with ease, and is generally so much fun to drive that maybe we're going to become the TractorWives?! Okay maybe not just yet, but we're in love with this tractor. Maybe we can even start a new landscaping side-hustle: C&J's Landscaping! Has a nice ring to it, eh? No more walking on sharp rocks, breaking our backs lifting for hours a day. The backhoe mode is kind of the opposite of the lifter mode, and after some trial and error, we were able to plant our first cedar tree with it. For anyone who's never operated a tractor before, it's almost like playing a video game like Smash Brothers, where your button inputs suddenly become backwards. We're so happy! We also checked in on our little seedlings in our green house and are so excited to show you how much they've grown already 🌞 And we're finally creating a pathway for our fruit garden. We can't wait to see what new projects we can complete with our new tractor friend. Give us your name suggestions below, we're going to read them all!\n\nJoin the Patreon Pack HERE!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/vanwives\n\nInstagram: @vanwives https://www.instagram.com/vanwives\nJaz - IG https://www.instagram.com/jazzyjoyy/\nCrystal - IG  https://www.instagram.com/crysdd/\nTikTok: @vanwives https://www.tiktok.com/@vanwives\nTwitter: @vanwives https://twitter.com/vanwives\n\n✉ MAIL ✉ \nPost Office Box 364\nBridgewater PO Main\nNova Scotia B4V2W9\nCanada \n\nBusiness Inquiries \nvanwives@night.co\n\nEdited by Colin Spencer Steingard- https://www.colinsteingard.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOur Journey! How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands. Thank you for being here with us for cabin life, van life and all the in between!\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY SUNDAY 9:30​​​​​​​​ EST 🌞 \n3+ Years of Van life with 2 dogs\nOff- Grid Living at our Cabin in the woods\n\nMUSIC: Brought to you by Music Bed- Elevate your films & projects with better music http://share.mscbd.fm/vanwives​​​​​​​​\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01QAXWPOF9GGI\n\nMUSIC: Brought to you by Music Bed- Elevate your films & projects with better music http://share.mscbd.fm/vanwives​​​​​​​​\n\n#vanlife​​​ #offgrid #farming",

With our never-ending renovations, improvements and gardening we've been doing this spring, we've decided to give our tired and sore backs some help by tag-teaming in a legend in the world of gardening: THE TRACTOR! A 2012 Kubota B26, bright orange tractor with 1800 hours on it to be precise 🤠 That's right, through a twist of fate and a bit of good fortune, we were able to get one recently and it's beautiful. And we need YOUR help in naming it! Please comment your names below! 👇 But first we have to learn how to drive it, use the bucket, backhoe and forklift. This thing turns on a dime, lifts giant payloads with ease, and is generally so much fun to drive that maybe we're going to become the TractorWives?! Okay maybe not just yet, but we're in love with this tractor. Maybe we can even start a new landscaping side-hustle: C&J's Landscaping! Has a nice ring to it, eh? No more walking on sharp rocks, breaking our backs lifting for hours a day. The backhoe mode is kind of the opposite of the lifter mode, and after some trial and error, we were able to plant our first cedar tree with it. For anyone who's never operated a tractor before, it's almost like playing a video game like Smash Brothers, where your button inputs suddenly become backwards. We're so happy! We also checked in on our little seedlings in our green house and are so excited to show you how much they've grown already 🌞 And we're finally creating a pathway for our fruit garden. We can't wait to see what new projects we can complete with our new tractor friend. Give us your name suggestions below, we're going to read them all!\n\nJoin the Patreon Pack HERE!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/vanwives\n\nInstagram: @vanwives https://www.instagram.com/vanwives\nJaz - IG https://www.instagram.com/jazzyjoyy/\nCrystal - IG  https://www.instagram.com/crysdd/\nTikTok: @vanwives https://www.tiktok.com/@vanwives\nTwitter: @vanwives https://twitter.com/vanwives\n\n✉ MAIL ✉ \nPost Office Box 364\nBridgewater PO Main\nNova Scotia B4V2W9\nCanada \n\nBusiness Inquiries \nvanwives@night.co\n\nEdited by Colin Spencer Steingard- https://www.colinsteingard.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOur Journey! How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands. Thank you for being here with us for cabin life, van life and all the in between!\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY SUNDAY 9:30​​​​​​​​ EST 🌞 \n3+ Years of Van life with 2 dogs\nOff- Grid Living at our Cabin in the woods\n\nMUSIC: Brought to you by Music Bed- Elevate your films & projects with better music http://share.mscbd.fm/vanwives​​​​​​​​\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01QAXWPOF9GGI\n\nMUSIC: Brought to you by Music Bed- Elevate your films & projects with better music http://share.mscbd.fm/vanwives​​​​​​​​\n\n#vanlife​​​ #offgrid #farming"

Y CON FEID y desde entonces con su parcera le caí\nCodeína con la Sprite\n\nPa llevarla al cielo\nElla se suelta el pelo, se muerde los labios y así rompe el hielo\nMami que reguero\nTu sigue tocándote que voy por los condones\nEso se te iba a explotar y yo te lo detone\n\nFEID\nYo la llevo al Cielo\nCuanto le doy los Kisses, le quito las Yezzy la jalo del pelo\nAsí rompemos el hielo\n\nEl pary en el depa, color verde la mota\nEn toda la noche no se bajó de la troca\nCuando le hablo nea se le cae la ropa\nAsicalaita el ferxxo no la rota\nWooo\nEn el cielo se le olvidan los modales\nEl abdomencito y ese buri naturales\nNena de caserío flow wival & alex\nRompimos el hielo en el perreo de la disco\nCuando ella se despidió otra más me pidió\nCogió mi número y después me escribió\nFuimos pa donde no nos vieran ella me saco la polera\nQue rico mami que hicimos de todo\n\nTu sigue tocándote que voy por los condones\neso se le iba a explotar\nY yo se lo detone\nYo la llevo al Cielo\nCuanto le doy los Kisses, le quito las Yezzy la jalo del pelo\nAsí rompemos el hielo\n\nMORA\nTu rompe el hielo\nY tranquila que yo lo derrito\nTu maldad me tiene ciego\n\nQue soy yo el que siempre le insisto\nOh oh\n\nSky Rompiendo:\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/skyrompiendo/\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/Sky.Rompiendo\nTwitter https://twitter.com/skyrompiendo\nTikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@rompiendoelbajo\n\nFeid:\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/feid \nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/feidMDE   \nTwitter https://twitter.com/feid\n\nMyke Towers:\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/myketowers/\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/myketowersof...\nTwitter https://twitter.com/myketowerspr\n\n#SkyRompiendo #Feid #MykeTowers #ElCielo\n\nMusic video by Sky Rompiendo, Feid, Myke Towers performing El Cielo (Official Video).

The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.\n\nSubscribe to DisneyMusicVEVO 🔔 for all the latest Disney music videos: https://www.youtube.com/@DisneyMusicVEVO?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Disney Music: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic\n\nMusic video by Awkwafina, Daveed Diggs performing The Scuttlebutt (From \"The Little Mermaid\"). © 2023 Walt Disney Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/cwVndj",
