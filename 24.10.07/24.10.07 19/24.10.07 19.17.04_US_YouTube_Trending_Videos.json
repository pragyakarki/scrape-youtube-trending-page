We kindly ask everyone to be mindful of others when commenting. \n\nAs of October 4th, Jillian still has family stranded in Asheville. We recorded this footage to authentically document the situation as it unfolded on the ground and to help spread the word about the catastrophic devastation so more people can help. \n\nWe invite you to join us in praying for and supporting the people affected in Asheville and throughout the states impacted by Helene. \n\nWays to Help:\n\n- BeLoved Asheville:\n  Venmo: [BeLoved-Asheville](https://venmo.com/BeLoved-Asheville)  \n  PayPal: [BeLoved Asheville](https://www.paypal.me/BeLovedAsheville)\n\n- Old Europe:\n  PayPal: @DangHeleneHelpOE\n\n- MANNA FoodBank:\n Donate Here (https://donate.mannafoodbank.org)\n\n- Asheville Survival Program: \n  Venmo: @AppMedSolid  \n  CashApp: $Streets1de\n\nWhy We Were There:\n\nOn September 25th, we were en route from Indiana to Charlotte, NC, with plans to spend one night in Asheville. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we found ourselves unexpectedly staying through one of the worst natural disasters in American history.\n\nAs Hurricane Helene approached, we began documenting the unfolding events to share the reality on the ground in real time. What started as a simple recording evolved into a short film that felt essential to capture.\n\nWe hope this video offers insight into the rapid, chaotic, and disorienting days leading up to and including Hurricane Helene’s landfall. Watching the footage from NC and neighboring areas, we believe our documentation is vital to understanding how this event unfolded and we hope it inspires you to help in whatever way you can. \n\nThank you for taking the time to watch our video.

Here's what I saw October 1st:\n\nI think the area is starting to get saturated with very legitimate help. I'm not sure how many more hands on deck are needed but I could be wrong. Water is the obvious thing needed since water systems have been compromised/contaminated so if you can find a reputable organization to donate to for water and food, that's a good idea. I was in Swannanoa this morning - they were hit HARD. The river swept through there killing people, reducing homes to rubble, and destroying businesses. I saw random people there just setting up tents with water, food, coffee, snacks. I think that's a great idea as people are in clean up mode, exhausted, sad and they need these things - they can't get these items anyway because maybe their car was crushed, their road is washed out, power is out so grocery stores are closed, etc. People need fuel for their generators (lines are hours long at the stations that are open). \n\nThere are communities stuck on top of mountains due to their only line of access being completely destroyed with no hope of it being fixed anytime soon. They're requiring air drops and rescues and these guys seem to be doing a good job if you'd like to donate - Aerial Recovery Group (links below).\n\nWellness checks in the region are a good idea. A friend sent me https://www.unitedway.org/ as a way to sign up to do wellness checks if you're local. I'm not sure how that organization works but it's an idea. You can also look in forums and see people asking about specific addresses.\n\nCrazy thing is, this is just a few communities. Asheville, Hendersonville, Burnsville, this whole region, needs assistance. People are coming to help in big ways now, though. I met a group down in the river today from Myrtle Beach, a search and rescue team. I talked with some Cajun Navy people on side by sides today.

What we found was far worse than we imagined—locals in despair, struggling to rebuild. Our focus was on delivering essential supplies we had prepped for just this kind of emergency, offering a small but important lifeline to those in need. While logistics were far from perfect, we utilized our leadership skills to help coordinate and ensure aid reached as many people as possible.\n\nIt was a humbling experience, and we’re reminded once again of the importance of being prepared, not just for ourselves, but to help others when disaster strikes.\n\n#HurricaneHelene #DisasterRelief #EmergencySupplies #SurvivalSkills #CommunitySupport #PreppingForGood #Preparedness #SurvivalCommunity #SelfReliance #SurvivalPreparedness",

            "description": "Iran has threatened to carry out a further “crushing attack” on Israel, after firing 180 ballistic missiles at its regional enemy.\n\nThe latest warning from Iran came after Israel’s Prime Minister said his country would retaliate for the latest Iranian missile strike.   Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet: “Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.”\n\nIran launched the missiles in retaliation for a series of Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and its capital Beirut which killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior commanders of the Iranian-backed militia group. \n\nIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, described the missiles fired at Israel as “a decisive response to the aggression of the Zionist regime”.  It’s reported that the order to launch the missiles was made personally by Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe Iranian attack came after Israel announced a major ground offensive in southern Lebanon. \n\nAnna Foster in Beirut presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jon Donnison, Lucy Williamson, Orla Guerin and Sarah Smith. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

The only existing hut I have that weathers the rain well is my brick and tiled hut. Previously I put most of my effort into brick making, but decided that roof tiles are more valuable in the short term as they can be used on a mud walled structure and will last as long as the mud and timber stay intact. But to make roof tiles I needed a large shelter to protect them while being made and drying. Previous workshops I built to house brick and tile production were large thatched huts on posts. These huts took a long time to build ranging from 3 to 5 weeks and requiring more timber. This time I built an A-frame hut for the same task. It only took 10 days to build and covered a large floor space, 4 x 4 m. If the job of the shelter is to only house materials then tall side walls are not necessary, only a large floor space. The shelter worked well, keeping the rain off the tiles. A kiln was also made with previously fired bricks and 42 of the 132 roof tiles were fired successfully. In conclusion, A-framed shelters make excellent work spaces for primitive projects while also being quick and easy to build\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #roofing  #tiles",

            "description": "A lot of people have been asking how they can help. Here's what I've seen from today (October 1st):\n\nI think the area is starting to get saturated with very legitimate help. I'm not sure how many more hands on deck are needed but I could be wrong. Water is the obvious thing needed since water systems have been compromised/contaminated so if you can find a reputable organization to donate to for water and food, that's a good idea. I was in Swannanoa this morning - they were hit HARD. The river swept through there killing people, reducing homes to rubble, and destroying businesses. I saw random people there just setting up tents with water, food, coffee, snacks. I think that's a great idea as people are in clean up mode, exhausted, sad and they need these things - they can't get these items anyway because maybe their car was crushed, their road is washed out, power is out so grocery stores are closed, etc. People need fuel for their generators (lines are hours long at the stations that are open). \n\nThere are communities stuck on top of mountains due to their only line of access being completely destroyed with no hope of it being fixed anytime soon. They're requiring air drops and rescues and these guys seem to be doing a good job if you'd like to donate - Aerial Recovery Group (links below).\n\nI hiked about 6 miles into Bat Cave today heading towards Chimney Rock. I'm not sure what they need because it's gone but like everywhere, they need food, water, gas. I'm hopeful that this whole community evacuated as there is just zero access to Chimney Rock/Lake Lure from the NW anymore. Downstream to Chimney Rock and Lake Lure, it's just a mess. I haven't physically seen it because I couldn't get there but I've seen videos. The clean up is going to be enormous. I do know that helicopters are heavily flying here due to no access so once again, Aerial Recovery and other organizations actively flying there need help (they're actually flying to MANY mountaintops within a couple hours).\n\nWellness checks in the region are a good idea. A friend sent me https://www.unitedway.org/ as a way to sign up to do wellness checks if you're local. I'm not sure how that organization works but it's an idea. You can also look in forums and see people asking about specific addresses.\n\nCrazy thing is, this is just a few communities. Asheville, Hendersonville, Burnsville, this whole region, needs assistance. People are coming to help in big ways now, though. I met a group down in the river today from Myrtle Beach, a search and rescue team. I talked with some Cajun Navy people on side by sides today.

Mario, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Toad: all gone and replaced with Kirby NPCs. One thing could restart the Mario party: Bowser. \n\nThe Super Mario World of the Mushroom Kingdom is quite bleak when there’s no Mario around, so Luigi makes it his business to call up his brother for a reunion tour. Hey, if it’s good for Liam and Noel, it’s good for these two.

                "description": "Years have passed and Luigi isn't exactly living his best life. Why is the green half of the Super Mario Bros feeling blue? Because he feels aimless. Mario, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Toad: all gone and replaced with Kirby NPCs. One thing could restart the Mario party: Bowser. \n\nThe Super Mario World of the Mushroom Kingdom is quite bleak when there’s no Mario around, so Luigi makes it his business to call up his brother for a reunion tour. Hey, if it’s good for Liam and Noel, it’s good for these two. So, turn the volume up as loud as it can go and enjoy Luigi’s Lament 3: BRING BOWSER BACK!\n\n🟣 Support Mashed and become a Mashed+ member today! https://www.youtube.com/@mashed/join \n\nProduced by Tom Jenkins and Ben Michael\nWritten by Huge Davies\nMusic Production and Performance by Alex Walker Smith\nPre-production by Liam McKeown\n\nRough by \nLiam McKeown\nAlan Ramirez\nBrandon Maker (https://www.twitter.com/Dante_Maker)\nArón Keyser (https://twitter.com/PrimatePunk)\nIzzi (https://twitter.com/Izzi8bit)\nKim Watson\nEsau \"LDranzer\" A.

            "description": "A lot of people have been asking how they can help. Here's what I saw October 1st:\n\nI think the area is starting to get saturated with very legitimate help. I'm not sure how many more hands on deck are needed but I could be wrong. Water is the obvious thing needed since water systems have been compromised/contaminated so if you can find a reputable organization to donate to for water and food, that's a good idea. I was in Swannanoa this morning - they were hit HARD. The river swept through there killing people, reducing homes to rubble, and destroying businesses. I saw random people there just setting up tents with water, food, coffee, snacks. I think that's a great idea as people are in clean up mode, exhausted, sad and they need these things - they can't get these items anyway because maybe their car was crushed, their road is washed out, power is out so grocery stores are closed, etc. People need fuel for their generators (lines are hours long at the stations that are open). \n\nThere are communities stuck on top of mountains due to their only line of access being completely destroyed with no hope of it being fixed anytime soon. They're requiring air drops and rescues and these guys seem to be doing a good job if you'd like to donate - Aerial Recovery Group (links below).\n\nI hiked about 6 miles into Bat Cave yesterday heading towards Chimney Rock. I'm not sure what they need because it's gone but like everywhere, they need food, water, gas. I'm hopeful that this whole community evacuated as there is just zero access to Chimney Rock/Lake Lure from the NW anymore. Downstream to Chimney Rock and Lake Lure, it's just a mess. I haven't physically seen it because I couldn't get there but I've seen videos. The clean up is going to be enormous. I do know that helicopters are heavily flying here due to no access so once again, Aerial Recovery and other organizations actively flying there need help (they're actually flying to MANY mountaintops within a couple hours).\n\nWellness checks in the region are a good idea. A friend sent me https://www.unitedway.org/ as a way to sign up to do wellness checks if you're local. I'm not sure how that organization works but it's an idea. You can also look in forums and see people asking about specific addresses.\n\nCrazy thing is, this is just a few communities. Asheville, Hendersonville, Burnsville, this whole region, needs assistance. People are coming to help in big ways now, though. I met a group down in the river today from Myrtle Beach, a search and rescue team. I talked with some Cajun Navy people on side by sides today.
