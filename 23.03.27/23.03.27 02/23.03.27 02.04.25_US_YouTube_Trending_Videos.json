            "description": "Undefeated two-time super middleweight world champion David “The Mexican Monster” Benavidez retained his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title with a bruising unanimous decision victory over former world champion Caleb Plant in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions. The judges’ final tallies were 117-111, 116-112 and 115-113.\n \nThe highly anticipated showdown between super middleweight rivals turned into the intriguing clash of styles that many predicted it would be, as Plant’s boxing acumen carried the early action until the brute force and high-volume power punching of Benavidez took over. After 12 grueling rounds in front of a sold out arena, the two fighters squashed their years long beef, embracing and expressing their mutual respect.\n\n“I know there was a lot said between us but in the end we settled this like men,” said Benavidez. “I’m happy we gave the fans the best rivalry of the year or the last five years. I’m just very happy.”\n \n“It’s a big rivalry but that’s what boxing is all about,” said Plant. “We came here and settled it like men. I take nothing from David. We haven’t been the best of friends but we got into the ring and we settled it like men. That’s what you’re supposed to do. He’s a helluva fighter.”\n \nAccording to CompuBox, Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) held a large advantage in power punches landed (180-68) but also out-landed Plant in jabs (30-23). Plant (22-2, 13 KOs) was the busier fighter, throwing 624 to Benavidez’s 551, but was unable to deter the late round onslaught from Benavidez.\n \n“I knew I had to take it step by step and round by round,” said Benavidez. “Caleb is a tough fighter. He’s not going to give you everything in the first few rounds so you have to find him. But I feel like I didn’t just show that I was a power puncher tonight. I showed that I had defense and head movement and I was able to move around the ring and cut the ring off really good.”\n \nPlant’s movement appeared to give Benavidez trouble throughout the early action, as Plant consistently landed two to three punch combinations and escape Benavidez’s counters. It wasn’t until round eight that Plant’s movement began to slow down and his attempts at holding were increasingly thwarted.\n \n“I was trying to hold him when necessary, punch him when necessary, and throw my combinations when necessary,” said Plant. “But when the best get in there with the best, you roll the dice and someone is going to come out with their hand raised and someone will come up short. And one thing that I pride myself on is that I roll with the best in the world. I haven’t ducked anyone and maybe we can have a rematch in the future.”\n \nAs the fight moved into the championship rounds, Benavidez pushed forward more aggressively, busting Plant’s nose and peppering him with short hooks from all angles. Plant stayed on his feet for the final bell, but his final attempts to turn the tide were thwarted by Benavidez. Asked post fight about his future plans, Benavidez set his sights squarely on undisputed 168-pound champion Canelo Alvarez.\n \n“I just want to tell everyone that I have a lot of respect for Canelo Alvarez but he has to give me that shot now,” said Benavidez. “That’s what everyone wants to see. Let’s make it happen.\nNow the fans are calling for this fight, the legends are calling for this fight, so let’s make it happen.”\n\n#DavidBenavidez #CalebPlant #BenavidezPlant\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

Dani Olmo scored the first goal for Spain with a flawless shot to the bottom tight corner assisted by Alejandro Balde. Norway wanted vengeance and had some great chances. After lots of back-and-forth chances, Joselu scored with a beautiful header into the left corner to extend Spain’s lead to 2-0 in his debut game. A minute later, Joselu scored again with a left-footed shot to the bottom right corner to extend Spain’s lead 3-0.

            "description": "Sweden and Belgium faced off in their qualification match for the UEFA 2024 Euro. Belgium took strong control on the pitch from the jump and Romelu Lukaku found his first goal of three in the 35th minute with a header to the bottom left corner. In the 49th minute, Lukaku scored his second from very close range to the bottom right corner following a corner and assist from Dodi Lukébakio. Sweden’s Zlatan Ibrahimović (Euro qualifier’s oldest player) entered the pitch in the 73d minute and had an excellent, though unsuccessful, header shot from inside the box. Lukaku secured his hat trick in the 82nd minute and Belgium went on to take a 3-0 finish home over Sweden.\n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #Belgium #Sweden\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

                "description": "Sweden and Belgium faced off in their qualification match for the UEFA 2024 Euro. Belgium took strong control on the pitch from the jump and Romelu Lukaku found his first goal of three in the 35th minute with a header to the bottom left corner. In the 49th minute, Lukaku scored his second from very close range to the bottom right corner following a corner and assist from Dodi Lukébakio. Sweden’s Zlatan Ibrahimović (Euro qualifier’s oldest player) entered the pitch in the 73d minute and had an excellent, though unsuccessful, header shot from inside the box. Lukaku secured his hat trick in the 82nd minute and Belgium went on to take a 3-0 finish home over Sweden.\n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #Belgium #Sweden\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

England jumped to a hot start in the first half and didn't look back, highlighted from goals by Declan Rica and Harry Kane. With his 54th goal in international competition, Kane become the record goal scorer for England. Italy failed to make much of a mark in the first half, but was able to change this during the second half. Featuring a pass from Lorenzo Pellegrini, Mateo Retegui slotted a beautiful strike to grab his first goal in his debut match.  Italy continued to press, looking for that second goal to tie the match, but England was able to hold on to a 2-1 victory for the first time since 1961 at Italy. \n\n#FOXSoccer #UEFA #England\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\n\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #Recovery #WhereWouldIBe",

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\n\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#QuandoRondo #Recovery #WhereWouldIBe"

Porsche in the US cannot sell you structural parts so to fix the structural damage i had to buy parts from UK Porsche and take them in my luggage. Only issue is i can't take airbags on the flight, so im hoping US Porsche will sell me them. \n\n👇 FOR MORE CONTENT CHECK OUT MY SECOND CHANNEL 👇\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@matarmstrongmk2\n\n⬇️ ALL MA MERCHANDISE ⬇️\nhttps://matarmstrong.co.uk/\n\n⬇️ Follow Me Here Aswell ⬇️\nhttps://facebook.com/matarmstrongbmx\nhttps://instagram.com/matarmstrongbmx",

                "description": "In this world exclusive, we drag race the first-ever hybrid, all-wheel-drive Corvette E-Ray against two Italian Supercars: the Ferrari F8 and Lamborghini Huracan Evo RWD.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Falcon Car Rental! \nhttps://falconcarrental.com\n\nUse coupon code HAGERTY for: \n5% off a 1- to 6-day rental!\n20% off a 7- to 27-day rental!\n35% off any rental 28 days or longer!\n\nIs the 2024 Corvette E-Ray quicker than the 2023 Corvette Z06? We explore that using numbers generated from our last episode, where the Z06 beat a Porsche 911 GT3 (992), an Audi R8 V10 Performance, and almost kept up with a Ducati Panigale V4 SP2.\n\nUsing his signature time-freeze technique, veteran automotive journalist Jason Cammisa shows us the outcome of the race and explains how it happened by walking back through slow-mo time at the finish line.\n\nThe Corvette E-Ray combines the Z06's wide body with the base Stingray's 6.2-liter LS2 V-8 and a front-mounted, 160-hp electric motor. Launches are now wheelspin-free and no-drama as the E-Ray rockets from 0-60 in just 2.4 seconds — making this the quickest Corvette in history.\n\nAnd, at 3925 lb, the heaviest. But also the first AWD Corvette and the first-ever hybrid Corvette. \n\nIt's a very quick sign of things to come!\n\n===\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

Previously, the server only evaluated the world in discrete time intervals (called ticks). Thanks to Counter-Strike 2’s sub-tick update architecture, servers know the exact instant that motion starts, a shot is fired, or a ‘nade is thrown.\n \nAs a result, regardless of tick rate, your moving and shooting will be equally responsive and your grenades will always land the same way.",

It might be surprising to hear of a sparkling young actor and her rocker husband setting up their first house in the “Arch City,” but Ryan and Dun relish an impulsive departure from the script.

From a basement boxing ring and a cold-plunge pool on the back porch, to a recording studio and a dramatic stone bust of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, that dream has come to full fruition. “I remember walking through the house and feeling like there was so much room to put our personalities into it,” says Dun. “Not only was this the first house that we designed together, but it was really the first time that both of us felt the freedom to put our mark on a place.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Debby and Josh's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-debby-ryan-and-josh-duns-treehouse-fantasy-home-in-columbus-ohio\r\n\r\nShop Debby and Josh’s home style!\r\n\r\nPlants/accessories:\r\nPolspotten Set of 4 Tattoo Cups: https://fave.co/40cH4Rc\r\nStagg Electric Kettle: https://amzn.to/42o4wge\r\n(Similar) Olivia & May 2 Piece Modern Ceramic Planter Pots: https://goto.target.com/4P5jaG\r\nHero Giant Corn Stool: https://amzn.to/3n8oyuO\r\n(Similar) Super Moss Deco Moss Small Mushroom: https://amzn.to/42ouCj7\r\n(Similar) Pose Mirror Hand Embellished: https://fave.co/3JTGe6D\r\nOpalhouse Outdoor Ceramic Planter: https://goto.target.com/9gGaVQ\r\nByredo Tree House Candle: https://fave.co/3LFYt0u\r\nMasion Margiela ‘REPLICA’ By The Fireplace Candle: https://fave.co/3JVwXuR\r\n(Similar) Sizikato Frog Incense Burner: https://amzn.to/3JVqHDn\r\nAcrylic Four in a Row: https://fave.co/3Z7cAyR\r\nPlunge The Cold Plunge: https://fave.co/402EsWb\r\n\r\nLighting:\r\nUrban Outfitters Wally Table Lamp: https://fave.co/3lpHxkj\r\nElk Home Transit Chandelier: https://fave.co/3Jvd5gG\r\nEtsy Gallery Paint Co.

                "description": "Read more: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a43328576/2023-dodge-challenger-srt-demon-170-revealed/\n\nFor the brand that rewrote the book on muscle-car horsepower, it would've been a disappointment if the pinnacle of the Hellcat V-8 didn't crack four figures. Thankfully, when it comes to horsepower, Dodge isn't in the business of disappointing. That's also why for the grand finale it resurrected the Demon moniker and built the ultimate streetable dragster. Enter the 2023 Challenger SRT Demon 170. It summons an otherworldly 1025 hp and 945 pound-feet of torque from its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8.\n\nSubscribe to Car and Driver http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoCARandDRIVER"

In the episode, Bronson starts in Corona Queens at La Cabaña for chicharron de Pollo and boiled yuca. Then we move around the corner onto Roosevelt ave for some al fresco dining under the 7 train at Tlayuda Oaxaqueña Sr. San Pablo for tlayuda de cecina and some cafe de olla(Mexican spiced coffee.) Finally, to wrap up this unforgettable day, Action takes Nick to Michael Solomonov's incredible meat skewer restaurant Laser Wolf. Solomonov and his chef Mike Mayo treat Action and Nick to the whole menu. ENJOY!\n\nP.S.
