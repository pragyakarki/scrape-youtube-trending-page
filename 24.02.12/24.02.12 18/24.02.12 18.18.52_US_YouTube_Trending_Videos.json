Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West. \n \nThe film also stars Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n \nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots), and a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman). \n \nDirected by acclaimed filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 26, 2025.\n \nWicked is produced by Marc Platt (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar® nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are David Nicksay, Stephen Schwartz and Jared LeBoff. \n \nBased on the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked is adapted for the screen by the stage production’s book writer Winnie Holzman and by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The Broadway stage musical is produced by Universal Stage Productions, Marc Platt, the Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone.",

            "description": "If you feel it, chase it. \n#TwistersMovie is only in theaters July 19.\n_____ \n \nThis summer, the epic studio disaster movie returns with an adrenaline-pumping, seat-gripping, big-screen thrill ride that puts you in direct contact with one of nature’s most wondrous—and destructive—forces. \n \nFrom the producers of the Jurassic, Bourne and Indiana Jones series comes Twisters,\na current-day chapter of the 1996 blockbuster, Twister. Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the Oscar® nominated writer-director of Minari, Twisters stars Golden Globe nominee Daisy Edgar-Jones (Where the Crawdads Sing, Normal People) and Glen Powell (Anyone But You, Top Gun: Maverick) as opposing forces who come together to try to predict, and possibly tame, the immense power of tornadoes.\n \nEdgar-Jones stars as Kate Cooper, a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her college years who now studies storm patterns on screens safely in New York City. She is lured back to the open plains by her friend, Javi (Golden Globe nominee Anthony Ramos, In the Heights) to test a groundbreaking new tracking system. There, she crosses paths with Tyler Owens (Powell), the charming and reckless social-media superstar who thrives on posting his storm-chasing adventures with his raucous crew, the more dangerous the better.\n \nAs storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed, and Kate, Tyler and their competing teams find themselves squarely in the paths of multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma in the fight of their lives.\n \nTwisters features an exciting new cast, including Nope’s Brandon Perea, Sasha Lane (American Honey), Daryl McCormack (Peaky Blinders), Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina), Nik Dodani (Atypical) and Golden Globe winner Maura Tierney (Beautiful Boy).\n \nFrom Amblin Entertainment, Twisters is directed by Lee Isaac Chung and is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall (Jurassic and Indiana Jones franchises) and by Patrick Crowley (Jurassic and Bourne franchises). The screenplay is by Mark L. Smith, writer of the Best Picture nominee The Revenant. Twisters will be distributed by Universal Pictures domestically and by Warner Bros.

There's a lot to cover and I also wanna touch on the rumours about some characters who'll show up in the film.\n\nSpoiler alert\n\nHeavy Spoilers ahead so if you don't wanna know then I highly recommend that you turn off now. Please hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe for videos like this every day. With that out the way, thank you for clicking this, now let's get into that brand new trailer.\n\n-\n\nNow the trailer actually had a spot running at the superbowl that showed some slightly different footage. I couldnt track it down for this video but I put out some feelers and apparently it had him suiting up and also showed a quick look at the job we see him working at in the teaser. It was him pretty much going through a mid life crisis and you Could say the MCU is going through a mid life crisis ey ey ey.\n\nAnyway we catch him working as a car salesman and this is one of the many jobs we've seen him doing in his trilogy. Firstly he worked as a need a hero merc and would go around telling pizza delivery guys to stop harassing women. Need a Hero was itself seen on a car with it being an advert ontop of Dopinders. Mobius was of course in a similar position as well and we know this movies gonna have some TVA involvement.\n\nIt makes sense that hes had to find other work too as since Fox was acquired by Disney he's sort of been left in the lurch a bit. All the way back in 2019 we had reynolds posting a photo of him at Marvel studios. He said he'd auditioned for the role of Anthony Stark and that a nice man with a taser escorted him to the ground. If you cast your mind back 5 years ago to 2019 then youll remember that was the year Captain Marvel and endgame were released. So yeah this has been a long time coming and we of course will see the return of Wolverine as well.",

Today we’re testing Fiverr vs Stich Fix to see if any of these digital personal stylists are worth it. What is the cost? Can Ai really determine what we should wear?

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 The Muraka\n1:11 Ch.1: checking in\n3:40 Ch.2: overwater villa tour\n10:25 Ch.3: underwater room tour\n13:19 Ch.4: life underwater\n16:43 Showering underwater\n18:37 Nightlife!!!",

We were starting to figure out the official lyric video for the song when stumbled upon PUIK’s short animation that she posted and was BLOWN AWAY. I immediately reached out to see if PUIK would be into doing the full official lyric video and she said she would LOVE to. I gave her full creative freedom to just do what the song inspired her do to create and honestly it couldn’t have been cooler or cuter in my own imagination. Thank you all for the support on this song, thank you to the co-writers and producers and team for creating it with me, thank you the incredible HUH YUNJIN for joining the song and truly completing it beautifully, and thank you to my beautiful soulmate Emily who I’m proud to forever be Stupid In Love with and inspired to write these songs about.

According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” said Mann. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, “Inside Out 2” releases only in theaters Summer 2024.",

            "description": "It’s the most miserable time of the year: tax season.\n\nAmericans are about to spend millions of hours and billions of dollars filing their federal income taxes, and they are pretty sure they know who is responsible for their pain: The misanthropes at the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nBut we’re here to convince you that the I.R.S. is not the problem.\n\nYes, it should be easy to file taxes. And yes, it should be free. That’s how it works in the rest of the developed world, and it could very easily work that way here, too. It is absurd that America’s tax system is so antiquated and complicated that most people must pay someone else to help them pay the government.\n\nSo what is standing in the way of progress?\n\nWatch.\n\r\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\r\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\r\n----------\r\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

And yes, it should be free. That’s how it works in the rest of the developed world, and it could very easily work that way here, too. It is absurd that America’s tax system is so antiquated and complicated that most people must pay someone else to help them pay the government.\n\nSo what is standing in the way of progress?\n\nWatch.\n\r\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\r\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\r\n----------\r\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

Here with a fresh new boxy look and lots of new tech and features, the new Lexus GX aims to combine road comfort with off road capability. Powered by a 3.4L twin-turbo V6, the GX makes 349 horsepower and 479 lb ft of torque. It also has tons of off road goodies like available 33 inch all terrain tires, a locking rear differential, crawl control and more. But does it live up to its rather steep price tag?

            "description": "Today Architectural Digest is welcomed by Sofía Vergara to tour her stunning home in Los Angeles. The ‘Griselda’ star had quite a challenge on her hands when first acquiring her palatial Beverly Park mansion–according to her, it resembled a castle you might find in Transylvania. But with the expert help of interior designer, Ohara Davies-Gaetano, Vergara’s home was transformed into a Mediterranean paradise in the heart of California. Ornate European touches fill the space, from an 18th-century French limestone fireplace to baroque antiques placed beneath a 19th-century Italian chandelier. Vergara’s home truly does transport you to the luxurious rivieras of Europe and makes a perfect sanctuary to enjoy for years to come. “My friends from Colombia find any excuse to visit. There’s just something about this place that makes guests want to stay. It’s special. I still wake up every day thinking, I can’t believe this is my life.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Sofía Vergara's stunning home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-sofia-vergaras-personal-la-paradise\r\n\r\nShop Sofía Vergara’s home style!\r\nhttps://www.architecturaldigest.com/shopping/sofia-vergara-open-door\r\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nCloset Organized by Linda Koopersmith @beverlyhillsorganizer\n\nWant even more AD?

            "description": "What is the Apple Vision Pro actually for? THIS… \nGet better sleep with $200 off your Eight Sleep Pod Cover using my code CLEO: https://www.eightsleep.com/cleo/\n\nIf you want to feel more optimistic about the future, consider subscribing.\n\nYou’ve seen the Apple Vision Pro. But this isn’t a product review. In this video, @mkbhd and I take a dive into what the future might actually look like with this category of tech - and why you should care. (With a cameo from @ryan !) \n\nHonestly, with all the jargon and hype (VR! AR! Spatial computing! Metaverse!), I’ve been tuning out the news about these devices for a while. But now, I think it’s time to turn the volume back up and pay attention. There is a deeply optimistic future that’s possible here. Not Ready Player One, but something else entirely. I’m going to try to show you what it might really look and feel like. If the Apple Macintosh helped unlock personal computing, and the iPhone unlocked computers in our pockets, what is this device supposed to unlock?\n\nMy optimistic take is that this kind of tech is the most direct path to a totally sci-fi ability I never thought I’d see in real life. Something physically impossible in the real world… but maybe not in a digital one…\n\n(Note: Apple did not sponsor or pay for this video in any way. I bought my Vision Pro and got it on Friday. Was it worth it? Watch and find out!)\n\nChapters: \n00:00 The Apple Vision Pro is here\n01:25 What is the Apple Vision Pro really FOR?\n03:09 How to use the Apple Vision Pro\n04:49 Teleporting to new places inside the Vision Pro\n06:00 How the Vision Pro tricks your brain\n07:25 The future of YouTube\n09:20 Digital objects in real life\n11:33 The problem with personas\n12:59 Teleporting to see people we love\n15:11 Why care about the Vision Pro\n16:50 To support our show, please consider subscribing \n\nAdditional reading and watching:\n- MKBHD’s Apple Vision Pro Review: https://youtu.be/86Gy035z_KA?si=RnqUtx6MchByCKe2\n - MKBHD’s Using Apple Vision Pro: What It’s Actually Like https://youtu.be/dtp6b76pMak?si=TdhO2gXs3ZHP7M9g \n- MKBHD’s Apple Vision Pro Unboxing https://youtu.be/SaneSRqePVY?si=gK5YXCnwC44r1mlt \n- Casey Neistat’s Apple Vision Pro in NYC: https://youtu.be/UvkgmyfMPks?si=yD4xGJm96OQUk-u8 \n- Apple’s Announcement: https://youtu.be/TX9qSaGXFyg?si=tDigMk8gHeR8FNk_ \n- Apple’s Demo: https://youtu.be/IY4x85zqoJM?si=LnGt0axMkU126Cvz \n- Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern’s Deep Dive: https://youtu.be/8xI10SFgzQ8?si=x02pMLFMgN0fNvCo \n \nBio:\nCleo Abram is an Emmy-nominated independent video journalist.

                "description": "What is the Apple Vision Pro actually for? THIS… \nGet better sleep with $200 off your Eight Sleep Pod Cover using my code CLEO: https://www.eightsleep.com/cleo/\n\nIf you want to feel more optimistic about the future, consider subscribing.\n\nYou’ve seen the Apple Vision Pro. But this isn’t a product review. In this video, @mkbhd and I take a dive into what the future might actually look like with this category of tech - and why you should care. (With a cameo from @ryan !) \n\nHonestly, with all the jargon and hype (VR! AR! Spatial computing! Metaverse!), I’ve been tuning out the news about these devices for a while. But now, I think it’s time to turn the volume back up and pay attention. There is a deeply optimistic future that’s possible here. Not Ready Player One, but something else entirely. I’m going to try to show you what it might really look and feel like. If the Apple Macintosh helped unlock personal computing, and the iPhone unlocked computers in our pockets, what is this device supposed to unlock?\n\nMy optimistic take is that this kind of tech is the most direct path to a totally sci-fi ability I never thought I’d see in real life. Something physically impossible in the real world… but maybe not in a digital one…\n\n(Note: Apple did not sponsor or pay for this video in any way. I bought my Vision Pro and got it on Friday. Was it worth it? Watch and find out!)\n\nChapters: \n00:00 The Apple Vision Pro is here\n01:25 What is the Apple Vision Pro really FOR?\n03:09 How to use the Apple Vision Pro\n04:49 Teleporting to new places inside the Vision Pro\n06:00 How the Vision Pro tricks your brain\n07:25 The future of YouTube\n09:20 Digital objects in real life\n11:33 The problem with personas\n12:59 Teleporting to see people we love\n15:11 Why care about the Vision Pro\n16:50 To support our show, please consider subscribing \n\nAdditional reading and watching:\n- MKBHD’s Apple Vision Pro Review: https://youtu.be/86Gy035z_KA?si=RnqUtx6MchByCKe2\n - MKBHD’s Using Apple Vision Pro: What It’s Actually Like https://youtu.be/dtp6b76pMak?si=TdhO2gXs3ZHP7M9g \n- MKBHD’s Apple Vision Pro Unboxing https://youtu.be/SaneSRqePVY?si=gK5YXCnwC44r1mlt \n- Casey Neistat’s Apple Vision Pro in NYC: https://youtu.be/UvkgmyfMPks?si=yD4xGJm96OQUk-u8 \n- Apple’s Announcement: https://youtu.be/TX9qSaGXFyg?si=tDigMk8gHeR8FNk_ \n- Apple’s Demo: https://youtu.be/IY4x85zqoJM?si=LnGt0axMkU126Cvz \n- Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern’s Deep Dive: https://youtu.be/8xI10SFgzQ8?si=x02pMLFMgN0fNvCo \n \nBio:\nCleo Abram is an Emmy-nominated independent video journalist.
