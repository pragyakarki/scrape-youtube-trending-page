ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

See the movie only in theaters and IMAX February 13.\n\nSet against the sun-bleached grit of Los Angeles, Crime 101 weaves the tale of an elusive jewel thief (Chris Hemsworth) whose string of heists along the 101 freeway have mystified police. When he eyes the score of a lifetime, his path crosses that of a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) who is facing her own crossroads. Convinced he has found a pattern, a relentless detective (Mark Ruffalo) is closing in, raising the stakes even higher. As the heist approaches, the line between hunter and hunted begins to blur, and all three are faced with life-defining choices–and the realization that there can be no turning back. \n\nAdapted from Don Winslow’s acclaimed novella of the same name, the film is written and directed by Bart Layton (American Animals, The Imposter).

When he eyes the score of a lifetime, his path crosses that of a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) who is facing her own crossroads. Convinced he has found a pattern, a relentless detective (Mark Ruffalo) is closing in, raising the stakes even higher. As the heist approaches, the line between hunter and hunted begins to blur, and all three are faced with life-defining choices–and the realization that there can be no turning back. \n\nAdapted from Don Winslow’s acclaimed novella of the same name, the film is written and directed by Bart Layton (American Animals, The Imposter). Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Nick Nolte round out the cast. \n\nConnect with Crime 101 Online\nhttp://www.Crime101.com/\nFollow Crime 101 on INSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/crime101film/\nLike Crime 101 on FACEBOOK :   \nhttps://www.facebook.com/Crime101Film/\n\nAbout Amazon MGM Studios: Amazon MGM (Metro Goldwyn Mayer) is a leading entertainment company focused on the production and global distribution of film and television content across all platforms.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN MERCH: https://foltyn.shop/\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."

Vamos ver quanto conseguimos ganhar nas apostas hoje! Obrigado por assistir! Agradeço a cada um de vocês pelo apoio nessa jornada. Me desejem sorte e nos vemos no próximo vídeo! Que comece a guerra!\n\nBrettski não deveria estar no cassino naquela noite. Ele havia se convencido de que o jogo de dados com bolha era apenas uma distração, um brilho inofensivo de luzes e dados quicando atrás de um vidro. Mesmo assim, lá estava ele, sentando-se no banquinho enquanto a cúpula eletrônica zumbia como se o reconhecesse.\n\nO primeiro lançamento foi forte — natural. Depois, outro. A máquina emitiu um sinal sonoro, os créditos se acumulando mais rápido do que Brettski conseguia processar. Ele manteve o rosto neutro, as mãos firmes, como um homem observando o sonho de outra pessoa. Os dados dentro da bolha pareciam hesitar antes de cada lançamento, como se estivessem ouvindo. Jogadores se reuniram. Sussurros se espalharam. Um segurança ficou parado tempo demais.\n\nBrettski apertou o botão novamente. Ponto entendido. De novo. De novo. Seu saldo subiu para números que ele só tinha visto em outdoors e decisões ruins. Uma garçonete se inclinou para mais perto, perguntando o que ele estava bebendo, mas seus olhos se voltaram para a tela em vez de para o rosto dele.\n\nFoi então que a primeira reviravolta aconteceu.\n\nA máquina congelou por um instante. Os dados pararam no meio do quique, suspensos de forma antinatural, antes de caírem em um sete perfeito. A tela piscou e se corrigiu. Nenhuma mensagem de erro. Apenas mais créditos. Brettski sentiu um arrepio percorrer sua espinha.\n\nUm homem apareceu ao lado dele — mais velho, terno elegante, sem crachá do cassino. \"Você não está ganhando\", disse o homem em voz baixa. \"Você está sendo pago.\"\n\nBrettski não perguntou por quem.\n\nEnquanto alarmes disparavam repentinamente em outros lugares do salão, sua máquina permaneceu em silêncio. O saldo ultrapassou mais um limite. A multidão diminuiu. As luzes se apagaram um pouco demais.\n\nEntão Brettski notou algo novo na tela, abaixo do total.\n\nUma contagem regressiva.\n\nSem rótulo. Apenas números diminuindo.\n\nO homem se inclinou novamente. \"Quando chegar a zero\", disse ele, \"a casa vem cobrar.\"\n\nOs dados começaram a tremer sozinhos.\n\nO dedo de Brettski pairou sobre o botão de saque enquanto a contagem regressiva chegava a dez... nove... oito...\n\n#caça-níqueis #blackjack #apostas #cassino #bacará #roleta\n\nQuem é Brettski? Brettski é um jogador profissional, semelhante às antigas lendas Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot ou Lady Luck HQ! Ao contrário dessas lendas, Brettski possui milhares de anos de conhecimento ancestral acumulado pelos anciãos, em habilidades como caça-níqueis, roleta, blackjack, craps, bubble craps, pôquer e bacará. O objetivo de Brettski como jogador profissional é simples: dominar Las Vegas, usando os fundos obtidos com jogos de azar. Inscreva-se para apoiar sua jornada rumo à dominação mundial."

                "description": "Присоединяйтесь к моему Discord, чтобы пообщаться со мной и нашим сообществом! Мы также проводим множество розыгрышей ТОЛЬКО в Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nМы СНОВА в казино, и, возможно, нам немного повезет?! Посмотрим, сколько мы сможем выиграть сегодня в азартных играх! Спасибо за просмотр! Я ценю поддержку каждого из вас на этом пути. Пожелайте мне удачи, и увидимся в следующем видео! Вперед, на войну!\n\nБретски не должен был быть в казино в тот вечер. Он говорил себе, что игра в крэпс с пузырьками — это всего лишь отвлечение, безобидное свечение огней и прыгающие кости, запечатанные за стеклом. И все же он сидел, скользя по стулу, пока электронный купол гудел, словно узнавая его.\n\nПервый бросок оказался удачным — естественный. Потом еще один. Автомат защебетал, кредиты накапливались быстрее, чем Бретски мог это обработать. Он сохранял нейтральное выражение лица, руки неподвижно стояли, как человек, наблюдающий за чужим сном. Кубики внутри игрального пузыря словно замирали перед каждым броском, будто прислушиваясь. Игроки собрались. Поползли шепотки. Охранник задержался слишком долго.\n\nБретски снова нажал кнопку. Смысл понятен. Снова. Снова. Его баланс поднялся до чисел, которые он видел только на рекламных щитах и ​​в результате неудачных решений. Официантка наклонилась ближе, спрашивая, что он пьет, но ее взгляд метнулся к экрану, а не к его лицу.\n\nВот тут-то и произошел первый поворот.\n\nАвтомат на мгновение замер. Кубики остановились в середине отскока, неестественно замерли, прежде чем выпасть идеальная семерка. Экран вспыхнул, а затем выровнялся. Никакого сообщения об ошибке. Просто еще кредиты. Бретски почувствовал, как по спине пробежал холодок.\n\nРядом с ним появился мужчина — пожилой, в элегантном костюме, без бейджа казино. «Вы не выигрываете», — тихо сказал мужчина. «Вам возвращают деньги».\n\nБретски не стал спрашивать, кто именно.\n\nВ то время как в других местах зазвонили сигнализации, его автомат замолчал. Баланс перевалил за очередной порог. Толпа поредела. Свет потускнел чуть сильнее, чем нужно.\n\nЗатем Бретски заметил что-то новое на экране, под итогом.\n\nОбратный отсчет.\n\nБез подписи. Просто цифры, отсчитывающие время.\n\nМужчина снова наклонился. «Когда он достигнет нуля, — сказал он, — казино придет забрать выигрыш».\n\nКости начали трястись сами по себе.\n\nПалец Бретски завис над кнопкой вывода средств, пока обратный отсчет опускался до десяти… девяти… восьми…\n\n#слоты #блэкджек #азартныеигрыши #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nКто такой Бретски? Бретски — профессиональный игрок, похожий на древних легенд Вегаса Мэтта, Блаффа, ДегенДальта, БигДжекпота или Леди Удачи! Однако, в отличие от этих легенд, Бретски обладает тысячелетним опытом, накопленным старейшинами в таких областях, как игровые автоматы, рулетка, блэкджек, крэпс, баббл-крэпс, покер и баккара.

Il s'était dit que le bubble craps n'était qu'une distraction, un spectacle inoffensif de lumières et de dés qui rebondissent derrière une vitre. Et pourtant, il était là, installé sur son tabouret, tandis que le dôme électronique bourdonnait comme s'il le reconnaissait.\n\nLe premier lancer fut puissant – comme toujours. Puis un autre. La machine émit un bip, les crédits s'accumulant plus vite que Brettski ne pouvait les assimiler. Il garda un visage impassible, les mains immobiles, tel un homme observant le rêve d'un autre. Les dés dans la bulle semblaient hésiter avant chaque lancer, comme s'ils écoutaient. Les joueurs se rassemblèrent. Des chuchotements se répandirent. Un agent de sécurité s'attarda un peu trop.\n\nBrettski appuya de nouveau sur le bouton. Le message était clair. Encore. Encore. Son solde grimpa jusqu'à des chiffres qu'il n'avait vus que sur des panneaux publicitaires et après de mauvais choix. Une serveuse se pencha vers lui pour lui demander ce qu'il buvait, mais ses yeux se portèrent sur l'écran plutôt que sur son visage.\n\nC'est alors que le premier rebondissement survint.\n\nLa machine se figea un instant. Les dés s'immobilisèrent en plein rebond, comme suspendus de façon anormale, avant de retomber sur un sept parfait. L'écran cligna, puis se corrigea. Aucun message d'erreur. Juste plus de crédits. Brettski sentit un frisson lui parcourir l'échine.\n\nUn homme apparut à côté de lui – plus âgé, en costume élégant, sans badge de casino. « Vous ne gagnez pas », dit-il doucement. « On vous rembourse. »\n\nBrettski ne demanda pas par qui.\n\nAlors que des alarmes retentissaient soudainement ailleurs dans la salle, sa machine resta silencieuse. Le solde franchit un nouveau seuil. La foule se clairsema. Les lumières s'atténuèrent légèrement.\n\nSoudain, Brettski remarqua quelque chose de nouveau sur l'écran, sous le total.\n\nUn compte à rebours.\n\nAucune inscription. Juste des chiffres qui défilaient.\n\nL'homme se pencha de nouveau. « Quand le compte atteindra zéro », dit-il, « la maison viendra encaisser. »\n\nLes dés se mirent à trembler d'eux-mêmes.\n\nLe doigt de Brettski plana au-dessus du bouton d'encaissement tandis que le compte à rebours affichait dix… neuf… huit…\n\n#machinesàsous #blackjack #jeuxdargent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ?

Er hatte sich eingeredet, Bubble Craps sei nur eine harmlose Ablenkung, ein harmloses Leuchten und hüpfende Würfel hinter Glas. Und doch saß er da, rutschte auf den Hocker, während die elektronische Kuppel summte, als würde sie ihn erkennen.\n\nDer erste Wurf war hart – eine Natural. Dann noch einer. Die Maschine piepte, die Credits stapelten sich schneller, als Brettski es verarbeiten konnte. Er behielt einen neutralen Gesichtsausdruck, die Hände ruhig, wie jemand, der den Traum eines anderen beobachtet. Die Würfel in der Blase schienen vor jedem Wurf zu zögern, als würden sie lauschen. Spieler versammelten sich. Geflüster verbreitete sich. Ein Wachmann verweilte zu lange.\n\nBrettski drückte erneut den Knopf. Punkt gemacht. Wieder. Wieder. Sein Guthaben schoss in die Höhe, wie er es sonst nur von Werbetafeln und Fehlentscheidungen kannte. Eine Kellnerin beugte sich näher und fragte, was er trinke, doch ihr Blick wanderte zum Bildschirm statt zu seinem Gesicht.\n\nDa geschah die erste Wendung.\n\nDer Automat fror kurz ein. Die Würfel blieben mitten im Sprung stehen, unnatürlich in der Luft, bevor sie auf eine perfekte Sieben fielen. Der Bildschirm flackerte auf und korrigierte sich dann. Keine Fehlermeldung. Nur mehr Credits. Brettski spürte einen Schauer über den Rücken laufen.\n\nEin Mann erschien neben ihm – älter, eleganter Anzug, kein Casino-Ausweis. „Sie gewinnen nicht“, sagte der Mann leise. „Sie bekommen Ihr Geld zurück.“\n\nBrettski fragte nicht, von wem.\n\nWährend anderswo im Saal plötzlich Alarme losgingen, blieb sein Automat stumm. Der Kontostand überschritt eine weitere Schwelle. Die Menge lichtete sich. Das Licht wurde einen Tick zu dunkel.\n\nDann bemerkte Brettski etwas Neues auf dem Bildschirm, unterhalb der Gesamtsumme.\n\nEin Countdown.\n\nKeine Beschriftung. Nur herunterzählende Zahlen.\n\nDer Mann beugte sich wieder vor. „Wenn es bei Null steht“, sagte er, „holt sich das Casino den Gewinn.“\n\nDie Würfel begannen sich von selbst zu bewegen.\n\nBrettskis Finger schwebte über dem Auszahlungsknopf, als der Countdown auf zehn… neun… acht… herunterzählte.\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski?

Se había dicho a sí mismo que el bubble craps era solo una distracción, un inofensivo resplandor de luces y dados rebotando tras un cristal. Aun así, allí estaba, deslizándose en el taburete mientras la cúpula electrónica zumbaba como si lo reconociera.\n\nEl primer lanzamiento fue duro, natural. Luego otro. La máquina emitió un pitido, y los créditos se acumularon más rápido de lo que Brettski podía procesar. Mantuvo el rostro neutral y las manos firmes, como quien ve el sueño de otra persona. Los dados dentro de la burbuja parecían vacilar antes de cada tirada, como si escucharan. Los jugadores se reunieron. Se extendieron los susurros. Un guardia de seguridad se demoró demasiado.\n\nBrettski volvió a pulsar el botón. Punto conseguido. Otra vez. Otra vez.

Una camarera se acercó y le preguntó qué estaba bebiendo, pero sus ojos se posaron en la pantalla en lugar de en su rostro.\n\nFue entonces cuando se produjo el primer giro.\n\nLa máquina se congeló brevemente. Los dados se detuvieron a mitad de rebote, suspendidos de forma antinatural, antes de caer en un siete perfecto. La pantalla parpadeó y luego se corrigió. Ningún mensaje de error. Solo más créditos. Brettski sintió un escalofrío en la espalda.\n\nUn hombre apareció a su lado: mayor, de traje elegante, sin placa del casino. \"No estás ganando\", dijo el hombre en voz baja. \"Te lo están devolviendo\".\n\nBrettski no preguntó quién.\n\nCuando las alarmas sonaron repentinamente en otra parte de la sala, su máquina permaneció en silencio.

Dia telah mengatakan pada dirinya sendiri bahwa bubble craps hanyalah pengalihan perhatian, cahaya lampu yang tidak berbahaya dan dadu yang memantul yang terlindungi di balik kaca. Namun, di sanalah dia berada, duduk di kursi saat kubah elektronik berdengung seolah mengenalinya.\n\nLemparan pertama menghasilkan angka yang besar—natural. Kemudian yang lain. Mesin berbunyi, kredit bertambah lebih cepat daripada yang bisa diproses Brettski. Dia menjaga ekspresi wajahnya tetap netral, tangannya tetap tenang, seperti seorang pria yang menyaksikan mimpi orang lain. Dadu di dalam gelembung itu tampak ragu-ragu sebelum setiap lemparan, seolah sedang mendengarkan. Para pemain berkumpul. Bisikan menyebar. Seorang petugas keamanan terlalu lama berdiri di sana.\n\nBrettski menekan tombol lagi. Poinnya tersampaikan. Lagi. Lagi. Saldonya naik ke angka yang hanya pernah dilihatnya di papan reklame dan keputusan buruk. Seorang pelayan koktail mendekat, bertanya apa yang sedang diminumnya, tetapi matanya malah melirik ke layar, bukan ke wajahnya.\n\nSaat itulah kejutan pertama terjadi.\n\nMesin itu membeku sesaat. Dadu berhenti di tengah pantulan, melayang secara tidak wajar, sebelum jatuh ke angka tujuh yang sempurna. Layar berkedip, lalu kembali normal. Tidak ada pesan kesalahan. Hanya kredit tambahan. Brettski merasakan hawa dingin menjalar di punggungnya.\n\nSeorang pria muncul di sampingnya—lebih tua, berjas rapi, tanpa lencana kasino. \"Anda tidak menang,\" kata pria itu pelan. \"Anda sedang dibayar kembali.\"\n\nBrettski tidak bertanya oleh siapa.\n\nSaat alarm tiba-tiba berbunyi di tempat lain di lantai kasino, mesinnya tetap diam. Saldonya terus naik melewati ambang batas lain. Kerumunan mulai berkurang. Lampu diredupkan sedikit terlalu banyak.\n\nKemudian Brettski memperhatikan sesuatu yang baru di layar, di bawah total.\n\nHitung mundur.\n\nTidak ada label. Hanya angka yang terus berdetik.\n\nPria itu mencondongkan tubuh lagi. “Saat mencapai nol,” katanya, “bandar akan datang untuk mengambil uang.”\n\nDadu mulai berguncang sendiri.\n\nJari Brettski melayang di atas tombol penarikan uang saat hitungan mundur turun ke sepuluh… sembilan… delapan…\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nSiapa Brettski?

Powtarzał sobie, że bubble craps to tylko odskocznia, nieszkodliwy blask świateł i odbijające się kostki zamknięte za szkłem. A jednak tam był, wślizgując się na stołek, podczas gdy elektroniczna kopuła brzęczała, jakby go rozpoznała.\n\nPierwszy rzut był mocny – naturalny. Potem kolejny. Maszyna zaćwierkała, a kredyty kumulowały się szybciej, niż Brettski był w stanie przetworzyć. Zachowywał neutralny wyraz twarzy, dłonie nieruchome, niczym człowiek obserwujący czyjś sen. Kostki w bańce zdawały się wahać przed każdym rzutem, jakby nasłuchiwały. Gracze się zebrali. Rozeszły się szepty. Ochroniarz zwlekał zbyt długo.\n\nBrettski nacisnął przycisk ponownie.

Kostki zatrzymały się w pół odbicia, nienaturalnie zawisły, zanim wypadły idealnie siedem. Ekran błysnął, a potem się naprawił. Żadnego komunikatu o błędzie. Tylko więcej punktów. Brettski poczuł dreszcz na plecach.\n\nObok niego pojawił się mężczyzna – starszy, elegancki garnitur, bez identyfikatora kasyna. „Nie wygrywasz” – powiedział cicho mężczyzna. „Zostajesz wypłacony”.\n\nBrettski nie zapytał, przez kogo.\n\nGdy alarmy nagle zaćwierkały gdzie indziej na podłodze, jego maszyna zamilkła. Saldo przekroczyło kolejny próg. Tłum się przerzedził. Światła przygasły odrobinę za bardzo.\n\nWtedy Brettski zauważył coś nowego na ekranie, pod sumą.\n\nOdliczanie.\n\nBez etykiety. Tylko spadające liczby.\n\nMężczyzna ponownie się pochylił. „Kiedy dojdzie do zera” – powiedział – „kasyno przychodzi po odbiór wygranej”.\n\nKości zaczęły się same trząść.\n\nPalec Brettskiego zawisł nad przyciskiem wypłaty, gdy odliczanie spadło do dziesięciu… dziewięciu… ośmiu…\n\n#sloty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski?

Laten we de strijd aangaan!\n\nBrettski had die avond eigenlijk niet in het casino moeten zijn. Hij had zichzelf voorgehouden dat bubble craps slechts een afleiding was, een onschuldige gloed van lichtjes en stuiterende dobbelstenen achter glas. Toch zat hij daar, op de kruk, terwijl de elektronische koepel zoemde alsof hij hem herkende.\n\nDe eerste worp was raak – natural. Toen nog een. De machine piepte, de credits stapelden zich sneller op dan Brettski kon bevatten. Hij hield zijn gezicht neutraal, zijn handen stil, als een man die naar de droom van iemand anders kijkt. De dobbelstenen in de bubbel leken voor elke worp te aarzelen, alsof ze luisterden. Spelers verzamelden zich. Gefluister verspreidde zich. Een bewaker bleef te lang staan.\n\nBrettski drukte opnieuw op de knop. Punt gemaakt. Opnieuw. Opnieuw. Zijn saldo steeg naar bedragen die hij alleen op reclameborden en bij slechte beslissingen had gezien. Een cocktailserveerster boog zich naar hem toe en vroeg wat hij dronk, maar haar ogen dwaalden af ​​naar het scherm in plaats van naar zijn gezicht.\n\nToen kwam de eerste wending.\n\nDe machine bevroor even. De dobbelstenen stopten midden in hun stuiter, onnatuurlijk zwevend, voordat ze op een perfecte zeven vielen. Het scherm flitste, en herstelde zich toen. Geen foutmelding. Gewoon meer credits. Brettski voelde een rilling over zijn rug lopen.\n\nEen man verscheen naast hem – ouder, in een net pak, zonder casinobadge. \"Je wint niet,\" zei de man zachtjes. \"Je wordt terugbetaald.\"\n\nBrettski vroeg niet door wie.\n\nTerwijl elders in het casino plotseling alarmen afgingen, bleef zijn machine stil. Het saldo overschreed een nieuwe drempel. De menigte dunde uit. De lichten werden net iets te gedimd.\n\nToen zag Brettski iets nieuws op het scherm, onder het totaal.\n\nEen aftelling.\n\nGeen label. Alleen cijfers die aftelden.\n\nDe man boog zich weer voorover. \"Als het op nul staat,\" zei hij, \"komt het casino het geld innen.\"\n\nDe dobbelstenen begonnen vanzelf te schudden.\n\nBrettski's vinger zweefde boven de uitbetalingsknop terwijl de aftelling aftelde naar tien... negen... acht...\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski?

Він казав собі, що бульбашковий крэпс — це просто відволікаючий фактор, нешкідливе сяйво вогнів та підстрибуючих кубиків, запечатаних за склом. І все ж він був там, ковзаючи на стілець, а електронний купол гудів, ніби впізнав його.\n\nПерший кидок був сильним — природним. Потім ще один. Машина запищала, кредити накопичувалися швидше, ніж Бреттскі міг їх обробити. Він тримав обличчя нейтральним, руки нерухомими, як людина, яка спостерігає за чужим сном. Кубики всередині бульбашки, здавалося, вагалися перед кожним кидком, ніби прислухаючись. Гравці зібралися. Поширилися чутки. Охоронець затримався надто довго.\n\nБретцкі знову натиснув кнопку. Справа вказана. Знову. Знову. Його рівновага підскочила до чисел, які він бачив лише на білбордах та під час невдалих рішень. Офіціантка, що грала коктейлі, нахилилася ближче, запитуючи, що він п'є, але її погляд ковзнув до екрана, а не до його обличчя.\n\nСаме тоді стався перший поворот.\n\nМашина на мить завмерла. Кубики зупинилися на півдорозі, неприродно зависли, перш ніж впасти на ідеальну сімку. Екран блимнув, а потім виправився. Повідомлення про помилку не було. Тільки більше кредитів. Бретцкі відчув, як по спині пробіг холодок.\n\nПоруч із ним з'явився чоловік — старший, у стильному костюмі, без значка казино. «Ви не виграєте», — тихо сказав чоловік. «Вам повертають гроші».\n\nБретцкі не питав, хто це робить.\n\nПоки деінде на підлозі раптово запищали сигналізації, його машина мовчала. Рівнина перекотилася через ще один поріг. Натовп розрідився. Світло трохи приглушилося.\n\nТоді Бретскі помітив щось нове на екрані, під загальною сумою.\n\nЗворотний відлік.\n\nБез напису. Тільки цифри, що цокають.\n\nЧоловік знову нахилився. «Коли дорівнює нулю», — сказав він, — «будинок приходить забрати гроші».\n\nКості почали трястися самі по собі.\n\nПалець Бретскі завис над кнопкою виведення готівки, коли зворотний відлік сплив до десяти… дев'яти… восьми…\n\n#слоти #блекджек #азартні ігри #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nХто такий Бретскі?

He’d told himself that bubble craps was just a distraction, a harmless glow of lights and bouncing dice sealed behind glass.

The balance rolled over another threshold. The crowd thinned. The lights dimmed just a shade too much.\n\nThen Brettski noticed something new on the screen, beneath the total.\n\nA countdown.\n\nNo label. Just numbers ticking down.\n\nThe man leaned in again. “When it hits zero,” he said, “the house comes to collect.”\n\nThe dice began to shake on their own.\n\nBrettski’s finger hovered over the cash-out button as the countdown dropped to ten… nine… eight…\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski?

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year old, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game, or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms. Roblox is a global platform where millions of people gather together every day to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds. The types of gameplay on Roblox are just as limitless as the imagination of the creators themselves. What is Roblox?

ROBLOX to wirtualny plac zabaw i warsztat online, gdzie dzieci w każdym wieku mogą bezpiecznie wchodzić w interakcje, tworzyć, bawić się i uczyć. Jest wyjątkowy, ponieważ praktycznie wszystko w ROBLOX jest projektowane i konstruowane przez członków społeczności. ROBLOX jest przeznaczony dla osób w wieku od 8 do 18 lat, ale jest otwarty dla osób w każdym wieku. Każdy gracz zaczyna od wyboru awatara i nadania mu tożsamości. Następnie może odkrywać ROBLOX — wchodząc w interakcje z innymi poprzez czatowanie, granie w gry lub współpracę przy kreatywnych projektach. Każdy gracz otrzymuje również własny kawałek niezagospodarowanej nieruchomości wraz z wirtualnym zestawem narzędzi, za pomocą którego może projektować i budować cokolwiek — czy to nawigowalny wieżowiec, działający helikopter, gigantyczny flipper, grę wieloosobową „Capture the Flag”, czy jakieś inne, jeszcze niewyobrażalne dzieło. Ta pierwsza wirtualna działka jest darmowa. Uczestnicząc w projektach i budując fajne rzeczy, członkowie ROBLOX mogą zdobywać specjalne odznaki, a także dolary ROBLOX („Robux”). Mogą oni również korzystać z katalogu online, aby kupować ubrania i akcesoria awatara, a także wysokiej jakości materiały budowlane, interaktywne komponenty i mechanizmy.

ROBLOX-ലെ പ്രായോഗികമായി എല്ലാം കമ്മ്യൂണിറ്റിയിലെ അംഗങ്ങൾ രൂപകൽപ്പന ചെയ്ത് നിർമ്മിച്ചതാണ് എന്നതാണ് ഇതിന്റെ പ്രത്യേകത. 8 മുതൽ 18 വയസ്സ് വരെ പ്രായമുള്ളവർക്കായി ROBLOX രൂപകൽപ്പന ചെയ്‌തിരിക്കുന്നു, പക്ഷേ ഇത് എല്ലാ പ്രായത്തിലുമുള്ള ആളുകൾക്കും തുറന്നിരിക്കുന്നു. ഓരോ കളിക്കാരനും ഒരു അവതാർ തിരഞ്ഞെടുത്ത് അതിന് ഒരു ഐഡന്റിറ്റി നൽകിക്കൊണ്ടാണ് ആരംഭിക്കുന്നത്. തുടർന്ന് അവർക്ക് ROBLOX പര്യവേക്ഷണം ചെയ്യാൻ കഴിയും - ചാറ്റ് ചെയ്തുകൊണ്ടോ, ഗെയിമുകൾ കളിച്ചോ, അല്ലെങ്കിൽ സൃഷ്ടിപരമായ പ്രോജക്റ്റുകളിൽ സഹകരിച്ചോ മറ്റുള്ളവരുമായി ഇടപഴകുന്നു. നാവിഗേറ്റ് ചെയ്യാൻ കഴിയുന്ന ഒരു അംബരചുംബി, പ്രവർത്തിക്കുന്ന ഒരു ഹെലികോപ്റ്റർ, ഒരു ഭീമൻ പിൻബോൾ മെഷീൻ, ഒരു മൾട്ടിപ്ലെയർ \"ക്യാപ്ചർ ദി ഫ്ലാഗ്\" ഗെയിം, അല്ലെങ്കിൽ മറ്റേതെങ്കിലും, ഇതുവരെ സ്വപ്നം കണ്ടിട്ടില്ലാത്ത സൃഷ്ടി എന്നിങ്ങനെ എന്തും രൂപകൽപ്പന ചെയ്യാനും നിർമ്മിക്കാനും കഴിയുന്ന ഒരു വെർച്വൽ ടൂൾബോക്‌സിനൊപ്പം. വെർച്വൽ ഭൂമിയുടെ ഈ ആദ്യ പ്ലോട്ടിന് യാതൊരു ചെലവുമില്ല. പങ്കെടുക്കുന്നതിലൂടെയും രസകരമായ കാര്യങ്ങൾ നിർമ്മിക്കുന്നതിലൂടെയും, ROBLOX അംഗങ്ങൾക്ക് സ്പെഷ്യാലിറ്റി ബാഡ്ജുകളും ROBLOX ഡോളറുകളും (\"Robux\") നേടാൻ കഴിയും. അതാകട്ടെ, അവതാർ വസ്ത്രങ്ങളും അനുബന്ധ ഉപകരണങ്ങളും, പ്രീമിയം നിർമ്മാണ സാമഗ്രികൾ, സംവേദനാത്മക ഘടകങ്ങൾ, പ്രവർത്തന സംവിധാനങ്ങൾ എന്നിവ വാങ്ങാൻ അവർക്ക് ഓൺലൈൻ കാറ്റലോഗ് ഷോപ്പുചെയ്യാം. ദശലക്ഷക്കണക്കിന് ആളുകൾ എല്ലാ ദിവസവും ഒത്തുചേരുന്ന ഒരു ആഗോള പ്ലാറ്റ്‌ഫോമാണ് റോബ്‌ലോക്സ്, അവിടെ ഉപയോക്തൃ-നിർമ്മിത 3D ലോകങ്ങളിൽ പരസ്പരം അനുഭവങ്ങൾ സങ്കൽപ്പിക്കാനും സൃഷ്ടിക്കാനും പങ്കിടാനും കഴിയും. റോബ്‌ലോക്സിലെ ഗെയിംപ്ലേയുടെ തരങ്ങൾ സ്രഷ്ടാക്കളുടെ ഭാവന പോലെ തന്നെ പരിധിയില്ലാത്തതാണ്. റോബ്‌ലോക്സ് എന്താണ്? റോബ്‌ലോക്സ് ഒരു ആഗോള പ്ലാറ്റ്‌ഫോമാണ്, അവിടെ ദശലക്ഷക്കണക്കിന് ആളുകൾ എല്ലാ ദിവസവും ഒത്തുചേരുകയും ഇമ്മേഴ്‌സീവ്, ഉപയോക്തൃ-നിർമ്മിത 3D ലോകങ്ങളിൽ പരസ്പരം അനുഭവങ്ങൾ സങ്കൽപ്പിക്കാനും സൃഷ്ടിക്കാനും പങ്കിടാനും ഒത്തുചേരുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു. റോബ്‌ലോക്സിലെ ഗെയിംപ്ലേയുടെ തരങ്ങൾ സ്രഷ്ടാക്കളുടെ ഭാവനയെപ്പോലെ തന്നെ പരിധിയില്ലാത്തതാണ്.\n\n#റോബ്ലോക്സ് #റോബ്ലോക്സ്റൈവൽസ് #ഷോർട്ട്സ്\nറയട്ട് ഷീൽഡ് എതിരാളികൾ\nപുതിയ ഷീൽഡ് എതിരാളികൾ\nവർക്കിംഗ് കോഡുകൾ എതിരാളികൾ\nഎതിരാളികൾ പ്രവർത്തിക്കുന്നവർ\nഎതിരാളികൾ കളിക്കാരൻ\nഷീൽഡ് റോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ\nഎതിരാളികൾ ഷീൽഡ്\nറയട്ട് ഷീൽഡ് റോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ\nഷീൽഡ് റയട്ട് എതിരാളികൾ\nസ്വാറ്റ് ഷീൽഡ് എതിരാളികൾ\nഎതിരാളികൾ ഷീൽഡ് അപ്‌ഡേറ്റ്\nഗൺബ്ലേഡ് റോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ\nബ്രിഡ്ജ് മാപ്പ് റിവാസ്\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ ബ്രിഡ്ജ് മാപ്പ്\nപുതിയ കോഡ് റോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ\nനിരോധിക്കപ്പെട്ട എതിരാളികൾ\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികളിൽ നിന്ന് നിരോധിച്ചു\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികളിൽ നിന്ന് എന്നെ വിലക്കി\nറാങ്ക് ചെയ്യപ്പെട്ട എതിരാളികൾ\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ റാങ്ക് ചെയ്യപ്പെട്ടു\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ റാങ്ക് ചെയ്യപ്പെട്ട അപ്‌ഡേറ്റ്\nപുതിയ അപ്‌ഡേറ്റ് റോബ്ലോക്സ്\nപുതിയ കോഡ് എതിരാളികൾ\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികളിലെ വർക്കിംഗ് കോഡുകൾ\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ ടാങ്ക്ആർ\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് എതിരാളികൾ റാങ്ക് ചെയ്യപ്പെട്ടു\nറാങ്ക് ചെയ്യപ്പെട്ട അപ്‌ഡേറ്റ് എതിരാളികൾ\nഎലോ എതിരാളികളെ എങ്ങനെ റാങ്ക് ചെയ്യാം\nഇതിഹാസ കീറ്റാന എതിരാളികൾ\nകീവോൾവർ സ്കിൻ എതിരാളികൾ\nകീ സ്കിൻ ഗിവ് എവേ എതിരാളികൾ\nസൗജന്യ കീ സ്കിൻ എതിരാളികൾ\nപുതിയ കോഡ് എതിരാളികൾ\nറാങ്ക് ചെയ്ത അപ്‌ഡേറ്റ് എതിരാളികൾ\nകെയ് എതിരാളികൾ\nറാങ്ക് ചെയ്ത ലീഡർബോർഡ് എതിരാളികൾ\nമികച്ച എതിരാളികൾ റാങ്ക് ചെയ്ത കളിക്കാരൻ\nനെമെസിസ് റാങ്ക് എതിരാളികൾ\nഒണിക്സ് റാങ്ക് എതിരാളികൾ\nദി ഹണ്ട് റോബ്ലോക്സ്\nറോബ്ലോക്സ് ഇവന്റ്\nപുതിയ റോബ്‌ലോക്സ് ഇവന്റ്\nദി ഹണ്ട് മെഗാ എഡിഷൻ റോബ്‌ലോക്സ്\nഹണ്ട് റോബ്‌ലോക്സ് മെഗാ എഡിഷൻ\nറോബ്‌ലോക്സ് ലോഞ്ചർ ഇനം\nസ്റ്റാർ ക്രിയേറ്റർ റോബ്‌ലോക്സ്\nറോബ്‌ലോക്സ് ദി ഹണ്ട് ഇവന്റ് വാർത്തകൾ\nദി ഹണ്ട് മെഗാ എഡിഷൻ\nഇവ അവഗണിക്കൂ! അൽഗോരിതം ഉപയോഗിച്ച് മുന്നോട്ട് പോകൂ!"

ROBLOX è un parco giochi virtuale online e un laboratorio, dove i bambini di tutte le età possono interagire, creare, divertirsi e imparare in tutta sicurezza. È unico nel suo genere perché praticamente tutto su ROBLOX è progettato e costruito dai membri della community. ROBLOX è progettato per ragazzi dagli 8 ai 18 anni, ma è aperto a persone di tutte le età. Ogni giocatore inizia scegliendo un avatar e assegnandogli un'identità. Può quindi esplorare ROBLOX, interagendo con gli altri chattando, giocando o collaborando a progetti creativi. A ogni giocatore viene inoltre assegnato un appezzamento di terreno non edificato insieme a una cassetta degli attrezzi virtuale con cui progettare e costruire qualsiasi cosa, che si tratti di un grattacielo navigabile, un elicottero funzionante, un flipper gigante, un gioco multigiocatore \"Cattura la bandiera\" o qualsiasi altra creazione ancora da concepire. Questo primo appezzamento di terreno virtuale è gratuito. Partecipando e costruendo oggetti fantastici, i membri di ROBLOX possono guadagnare badge speciali e dollari ROBLOX (\"Robux\"). A loro volta, possono acquistare dal catalogo online abbigliamento e accessori per avatar, nonché materiali da costruzione di alta qualità, componenti interattivi e meccanismi funzionanti. Roblox è una piattaforma globale in cui milioni di persone si riuniscono ogni giorno per immaginare, creare e condividere esperienze in mondi 3D immersivi generati dagli utenti. Le tipologie di gameplay su Roblox sono infinite quanto l'immaginazione dei creatori stessi. Cos'è Roblox?

Keunikannya terletak pada hampir semua hal di ROBLOX dirancang dan dibangun oleh anggota komunitas. ROBLOX dirancang untuk usia 8 hingga 18 tahun, tetapi terbuka untuk semua usia. Setiap pemain memulai dengan memilih avatar dan memberinya identitas. Mereka kemudian dapat menjelajahi ROBLOX — berinteraksi dengan orang lain melalui obrolan, bermain game, atau berkolaborasi dalam proyek kreatif. Setiap pemain juga diberikan sebidang lahan virtual yang belum dikembangkan beserta kotak peralatan virtual untuk mendesain dan membangun apa pun — baik itu gedung pencakar langit yang dapat dijelajahi, helikopter yang berfungsi, mesin pinball raksasa, game \"Capture the Flag\" multipemain, atau kreasi lain yang belum pernah terbayangkan. Tidak ada biaya untuk lahan virtual pertama ini. Dengan berpartisipasi dan membangun hal-hal keren, anggota ROBLOX dapat memperoleh lencana khusus serta mata uang ROBLOX (“Robux”). Sebagai gantinya, mereka dapat berbelanja di katalog online untuk membeli pakaian dan aksesori avatar serta bahan bangunan premium, komponen interaktif, dan mekanisme yang berfungsi.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year old, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game, or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms. Roblox is a global platform where millions of people gather together every day to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds. The types of gameplay on Roblox are just as limitless as the imagination of the creators themselves. What is Roblox?

ROBLOX — это онлайн-виртуальная игровая площадка и мастерская, где дети всех возрастов могут безопасно общаться, творить, развлекаться и учиться. Его уникальность заключается в том, что практически всё в ROBLOX создаётся и разрабатывается членами сообщества. ROBLOX предназначен для детей от 8 до 18 лет, но открыт для людей всех возрастов. Каждый игрок начинает с выбора аватара и присвоения ему имени. Затем он может исследовать ROBLOX — взаимодействовать с другими, общаясь в чате, играя в игры или сотрудничая над творческими проектами. Каждому игроку также предоставляется собственный участок необработанной виртуальной земли вместе с виртуальным набором инструментов, с помощью которого можно проектировать и строить что угодно — будь то небоскрёб, по которому можно перемещаться, работающий вертолёт, гигантский пинбол, многопользовательская игра «Захват флага» или какое-либо другое, ещё не придуманное творение. Первый участок виртуальной земли предоставляется бесплатно. Участвуя в игре и создавая интересные вещи, участники ROBLOX могут зарабатывать специальные значки, а также виртуальную валюту ROBLOX («Robux»). В свою очередь, они могут покупать в онлайн-каталоге одежду и аксессуары для аватаров, а также премиальные строительные материалы, интерактивные компоненты и рабочие механизмы. Roblox — это глобальная платформа, где миллионы людей ежедневно собираются вместе, чтобы представлять, создавать и делиться опытом друг с другом в захватывающих, созданных пользователями 3D-мирах.

ROBLOX — це віртуальний онлайн-майстерня та майстерня, де діти різного віку можуть безпечно взаємодіяти, творити, розважатися та навчатися. Вона унікальна тим, що практично все в ROBLOX розроблено та створено членами спільноти. ROBLOX розроблений для дітей віком від 8 до 18 років, але відкритий для людей різного віку. Кожен гравець починає з вибору аватара та надання йому ідентичності. Потім вони можуть досліджувати ROBLOX — взаємодіяти з іншими через чат, ігри або співпрацювати над творчими проектами. Кожному гравцеві також надається власна ділянка незабудованої нерухомості разом із віртуальним набором інструментів, за допомогою якого можна проектувати та будувати що завгодно — будь то хмарочос, яким можна керувати, робочий гелікоптер, гігантський пінбольний автомат, багатокористувацька гра «Захоплення прапора» чи якесь інше, ще не уявне творіння. Ця перша ділянка віртуальної землі є безкоштовною. Беручи участь та створюючи круті речі, учасники ROBLOX можуть заробляти спеціальні значки, а також долари ROBLOX («Robux»). У свою чергу, вони можуть купувати в онлайн-каталозі одяг та аксесуари для аватарів, а також високоякісні будівельні матеріали, інтерактивні компоненти та робочі механізми. Roblox — це глобальна платформа, де мільйони людей щодня збираються разом, щоб уявляти, творити та ділитися досвідом один з одним у захопливих, створених користувачами 3D-світах. Типи ігрового процесу на Roblox такі ж безмежні, як і уява самих творців. Що таке Roblox?

Roblox는 모든 연령대의 아이들이 안전하게 소통하고, 창작하고, 즐기고, 배울 수 있는 온라인 가상 놀이터이자 작업 공간입니다. Roblox의 거의 모든 콘텐츠는 커뮤니티 회원들이 직접 디자인하고 제작한다는 점에서 독특합니다. Roblox는 8세에서 18세 사이의 사용자를 위해 설계되었지만, 모든 연령대의 사람들이 이용할 수 있습니다. 모든 플레이어는 아바타를 선택하고 자신만의 정체성을 부여하는 것으로 시작합니다. 그런 다음 Roblox를 탐험하며 다른 플레이어와 채팅하고, 게임을 플레이하고, 창작 프로젝트를 공동 작업하며 소통할 수 있습니다. 각 플레이어에게는 미개발된 가상 토지와 가상 도구 상자가 제공됩니다. 이 도구를 사용하여 무엇이든 디자인하고 만들 수 있습니다. 실제로 움직일 수 있는 고층 빌딩, 작동하는 헬리콥터, 거대한 핀볼 기계, 멀티플레이어 \"깃발 뺏기\" 게임, 또는 아직 상상조차 하지 못한 창작물까지 만들 수 있습니다. 이 첫 번째 가상 토지는 무료로 제공됩니다. ROBLOX 회원들은 참여하고 멋진 콘텐츠를 제작함으로써 특별 배지와 ROBLOX 달러(\"Robux\")를 획득할 수 있습니다. 획득한 Robux로는 온라인 카탈로그에서 아바타 의상과 액세서리, 프리미엄 건축 자재, 상호 작용 구성 요소, 작동 메커니즘 등을 구매할 수 있습니다. Roblox는 전 세계 수백만 명의 사람들이 매일 모여 몰입감 넘치는 사용자 제작 3D 세계에서 서로 상상하고, 만들고, 경험을 공유하는 글로벌 플랫폼입니다. Roblox에서 즐길 수 있는 게임 유형은 제작자의 상상력만큼이나 무궁무진합니다. Roblox란 무엇일까요?

ROBLOX é um playground e oficina virtual online, onde crianças de todas as idades podem interagir, criar, se divertir e aprender com segurança. Sua singularidade reside no fato de que praticamente tudo no ROBLOX é projetado e construído por membros da comunidade. O ROBLOX é voltado para crianças e adolescentes de 8 a 18 anos, mas está aberto a pessoas de todas as idades. Cada jogador começa escolhendo um avatar e dando a ele uma identidade. Em seguida, pode explorar o ROBLOX — interagindo com outros jogadores por meio de bate-papo, jogos ou colaborando em projetos criativos. Cada jogador também recebe seu próprio terreno virtual não desenvolvido, juntamente com uma caixa de ferramentas virtual para projetar e construir qualquer coisa — seja um arranha-céu navegável, um helicóptero funcional, uma máquina de pinball gigante, um jogo multiplayer de \"Capture a Bandeira\" ou alguma outra criação ainda não imaginada. Não há custo para este primeiro terreno virtual. Ao participar e criar coisas incríveis, os membros do ROBLOX podem ganhar distintivos especiais, bem como dólares ROBLOX (“Robux”). Com eles, podem comprar roupas e acessórios para seus avatares no catálogo online, além de materiais de construção premium, componentes interativos e mecanismos funcionais. O Roblox é uma plataforma global onde milhões de pessoas se reúnem diariamente para imaginar, criar e compartilhar experiências em mundos 3D imersivos criados pelos usuários. Os tipos de jogos no Roblox são tão ilimitados quanto a imaginação dos próprios criadores. O que é Roblox?

ROBLOX הוא גן שעשועים וירטואלי מקוון וסדנה, שבו ילדים בכל הגילאים יכולים לתקשר, ליצור, ליהנות וללמוד בבטחה. ייחודי בכך שכמעט כל דבר ב-ROBLOX מתוכנן ונבנה על ידי חברי הקהילה. ROBLOX מיועד לגילאי 8 עד 18, אך פתוח לאנשים בכל הגילאים. כל שחקן מתחיל בבחירת אווטאר ומתן זהות לו. לאחר מכן הם יכולים לחקור את ROBLOX - לתקשר עם אחרים על ידי צ'אט, משחקי משחקים או שיתוף פעולה בפרויקטים יצירתיים. כל שחקן מקבל גם פיסת קרקע לא מפותחת משלו יחד עם ארגז כלים וירטואלי שבאמצעותו ניתן לעצב ולבנות כל דבר - בין אם זה גורד שחקים ניווט, מסוק פעיל, מכונת פינבול ענקית, משחק מרובה משתתפים \"לכידת הדגל\", או יצירה אחרת שטרם הומצאה. אין עלות עבור חלקת אדמה וירטואלית ראשונה זו. על ידי השתתפות ובניית דברים מגניבים, חברי ROBLOX יכולים להרוויח תגים מיוחדים וכן דולרים של ROBLOX (\"Robux\"). בתורם, הם יכולים לקנות בקטלוג המקוון בגדים ואביזרים לאווטארים, כמו גם חומרי בנייה איכותיים, רכיבים אינטראקטיביים ומנגנוני עבודה.

Roblox ist ein virtueller Online-Spielplatz und eine Werkstatt, in der Kinder jeden Alters sicher interagieren, kreativ sein, Spaß haben und lernen können. Das Besondere an Roblox ist, dass praktisch alles von Mitgliedern der Community entworfen und gebaut wird. Roblox ist für 8- bis 18-Jährige gedacht, steht aber allen Altersgruppen offen. Jeder Spieler beginnt mit der Auswahl eines Avatars und gibt ihm eine Identität. Anschließend können sie Roblox erkunden und mit anderen chatten, Spiele spielen oder an kreativen Projekten zusammenarbeiten. Jeder Spieler erhält außerdem ein eigenes, unbebautes Grundstück sowie eine virtuelle Werkzeugkiste, mit der er alles Mögliche entwerfen und bauen kann – sei es ein begehbarer Wolkenkratzer, ein funktionierender Hubschrauber, ein riesiger Flipperautomat, ein Multiplayer-„Capture the Flag“-Spiel oder eine andere, noch nie dagewesene Kreation. Das erste virtuelle Grundstück ist kostenlos. Durch die Teilnahme an Roblox und das Erstellen toller Inhalte können Mitglieder spezielle Abzeichen und Roblox-Dollar („Robux“) verdienen. Damit können sie im Online-Katalog Avatar-Kleidung und -Accessoires sowie Premium-Baumaterialien, interaktive Komponenten und funktionierende Mechanismen kaufen. Roblox ist eine globale Plattform, auf der sich täglich Millionen von Menschen treffen, um in immersiven, nutzergenerierten 3D-Welten ihrer Fantasie freien Lauf zu lassen, kreativ zu sein und Erlebnisse miteinander zu teilen.

Dit eerste stuk virtueel land is gratis. Door deel te nemen en coole dingen te bouwen, kunnen ROBLOX-leden speciale badges en ROBLOX-dollars (\"Robux\") verdienen.

ROBLOX está diseñado para niños de 8 a 18 años, pero está abierto a personas de todas las edades. Cada jugador comienza eligiendo un avatar y dándole una identidad. Después, pueden explorar ROBLOX, interactuando con otros mediante chat, juegos o colaborando en proyectos creativos. Cada jugador también recibe su propio terreno sin desarrollar junto con una caja de herramientas virtual para diseñar y construir cualquier cosa, ya sea un rascacielos navegable, un helicóptero funcional, una máquina de pinball gigante, un juego multijugador de \"Captura la Bandera\" o cualquier otra creación aún por desarrollar. Este primer terreno virtual es gratuito. Al participar y crear cosas geniales, los miembros de ROBLOX pueden ganar insignias especiales y dólares ROBLOX (\"Robux\"). A cambio, pueden comprar ropa y accesorios para avatares en el catálogo en línea, además de materiales de construcción premium, componentes interactivos y mecanismos de trabajo.
