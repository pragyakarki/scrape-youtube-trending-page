            "description": "Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Peter Jackson\nVideo Producers: Peter Jackson, Clare Olssen, Jonathan Clyde\nAudio Producers: Paul McCartney and Giles Martin\nProduction Company: WingNut Films Productions Ltd\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists Subscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup Sign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   Stream The Beatles: 🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic 🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify 🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic 🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora 🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal 🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer 🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   Follow The Beatles:  ⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com ⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr",

The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles.

            "description": "The Stuntman becomes the hero. #TheFallGuyMovie only in theaters March 1.\n\n------\n\nHe’s a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right? \n\nFrom real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy. \n\nOscar® nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie—being directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)—goes missing.\n\nWhile the film’s ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film’s most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody’s good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.\n\nInspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). \n\nFrom a screenplay by Hobbs & Shaw screenwriter Drew Pearce, The Fall Guy is produced by Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, Nobody, Atomic Blonde) and David Leitch for their company 87North, and by Ryan Gosling and by Guymon Casady (Game of Thrones, Steve Jobs and executive producer of the upcoming series Ripley) for Entertainment 360. The film is executive produced by Drew Pearce, Entertainment 360’s Geoff Shaevitz and the creator of the original Fall Guy television series, Glen A. Larson.\n\nWebsite: http://www.TheFallGuyMovie.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thefallguymovie \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thefallguymovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Universalpics \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures\nX: https://twitter.com/thefallguymovie",

But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.\n\nInspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). \n\nFrom a screenplay by Hobbs & Shaw screenwriter Drew Pearce, The Fall Guy is produced by Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, Nobody, Atomic Blonde) and David Leitch for their company 87North, and by Ryan Gosling and by Guymon Casady (Game of Thrones, Steve Jobs and executive producer of the upcoming series Ripley) for Entertainment 360. The film is executive produced by Drew Pearce, Entertainment 360’s Geoff Shaevitz and the creator of the original Fall Guy television series, Glen A. Larson.\n\nWebsite: http://www.TheFallGuyMovie.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thefallguymovie \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thefallguymovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Universalpics \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures\nX: https://twitter.com/thefallguymovie"

            "title": "The Beatles - Now And Then - The Last Beatles Song (Short Film)",
            "description": "Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.\n\nVideo Director: Oliver Murray \nProducers: Jonathan Clyde and Sophie Hilton \nOriginal score: Paul Englishby \nSound Designer: Alastair Sirkett \nAudio Restoration: Park Road Post Production\n\nPre-order Now And Then: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/NowAndThenYT\nPre-order Red and Blue: https://TheBeatles.lnk.to/RedAndBlue2023YT\n\nWatch more videos from The Beatles: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTPlaylists \nSubscribe to The Beatles’ YouTube channel & ring the bell to never miss a new video: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/YTSignup \nSign up for The Beatles’ Official Email List: https://www.thebeatles.com/newsletter   \n\nStream The Beatles: \n🎙️ Apple Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AppleMusic \n🎙️ Spotify: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Spotify \n🎙️ Amazon Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/AmazonMusic \n🎙️ Pandora: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Pandora \n🎙️ Tidal: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Tidal \n🎙️ Deezer: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/Deezer \n🎙️ YouTube Music: https://thebeatles.lnk.to/stream/YouTubeMusic   \n\nFollow The Beatles:  \n⭐ https://www.thebeatles.com \n⭐ https://www.instagram.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.facebook.com/thebeatles\n⭐ https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeatles\n⭐ https://twitter.com/thebeatles\n \n#TheBeatles #NowAndThen #JohnLennon #PaulMcCartney #GeorgeHarrison #RingoStarr",

                "description": "Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles.

The previous blower design is tear drop shaped so that the direction that the fan spins is un important. Also with the previous design the impeller spins one way and then the other as it is powered by a simple string mechanism.\n\n In the new design, a weight was employed in the form of a heavy log attached to the rotor. The top of the rotor is held and the weight spun to create rotation. This method produces less rpm than the original but allows the fan to be spun continuously in one direction only. To compensate for the lower rpm, the fan was doubled in size (from 25 cm to 50 cm) to increase blade tip speed and so air speed.\n\nNow with a fan that spins in one direction only, a housing could be used to take advantage of this fact. A volute is an expanding spiral and housing for fans that are volute shaped help guide the air from the center to the outlet more efficiently than a tear drop shaped one. This was made using mud on the ground as opposed to a clay portable one as it was starting to get too big to transport.\n\nThe fan was tested in an iron smelt. Disappointingly, it only produced a bit of iron in the form of much smaller prills than usual due to the low rpm and hence air pressure than the original blower. After some rough calculations from research, this design might become competitive with the original blower if the fan diameter was scaled up to 1m diameter from the original 25 cm diameter fan. \n\nThe advantage of this design is that it is simpler and has fewer components than the original as there is no string that needs replacing. The dis advantage is that for it to produce good pressure it's diameter needs to be scaled up to the point where it is no longer compact and portable.\n\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

The previous blower design is tear drop shaped so that the direction that the fan spins is un important. Also with the previous design the impeller spins one way and then the other as it is powered by a simple string mechanism.\n\n In the new design, a weight was employed in the form of a heavy log attached to the rotor. The top of the rotor is held and the weight spun to create rotation. This method produces less rpm than the original but allows the fan to be spun continuously in one direction only. To compensate for the lower rpm, the fan was doubled in size (from 25 cm to 50 cm) to increase blade tip speed and so air speed.\n\nNow with a fan that spins in one direction only, a housing could be used to take advantage of this fact. A volute is an expanding spiral and housing for fans that are volute shaped help guide the air from the center to the outlet more efficiently than a tear drop shaped one. This was made using mud on the ground as opposed to a clay portable one as it was starting to get too big to transport.\n\nThe fan was tested in an iron smelt. Disappointingly, it only produced a bit of iron in the form of much smaller prills than usual due to the low rpm and hence air pressure than the original blower. After some rough calculations from research, this design might become competitive with the original blower if the fan diameter was scaled up to 1m diameter from the original 25 cm diameter fan. \n\nThe advantage of this design is that it is simpler and has fewer components than the original as there is no string that needs replacing. The dis advantage is that for it to produce good pressure it's diameter needs to be scaled up to the point where it is no longer compact and portable.\n\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

With a retail cost of over $8000, in my review I’ll show you exactly what the experience is like. From the lounge offered at the airport, to the onboard experience including the bed, food service and what exactly is upstairs on the Boeing 747? This is an ultra long haul flight, and is actually the world's longest 747 flight at over 15 hours in the sky!

            "description": "[LYRICS BELOW] \"To Be a Man\" is making an IMPACT. I truly believe there are millions more to touch with this song. I travelled to Nashville to complete this and had the pleasure of working with the legend Darius Rucker. I'm still in shock. Share this with everyone and anyone and let's make an impact with music FOR THE PEOPLE spread BY THE PEOPLE. Somebody out there needs this. Love y'all...Thank you. \n\nClick here to listen:\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/tbam\n\n\nFollow DAX: @thatsdax\nDirected by: Logan Meis \nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#ToBeAMan #Dax #Dariusrucker #masculinity #manhood #manosphere #masculine #men #traditionalman #remix \n\n\nLyrics:\n\nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road, and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not about how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nBeing a man is what you make it\nyou can’t always live up to expectations\nYou try to please everybody while you struggle so you fake it and end up out of balance compromising situations \nAs a good man\nA do what he should man\nA give everything he has and do everything he could man\nYou might find yourself feeling all alone\nInside a house you built that you don’t recognize as home\nAnd that’s what my daddy told me\nAnd i’ll tell my son the same\nNow that I’m older I relate and I actually feel his pain\nHe never cried\nHe might of lied but he did not complain \nAnd he said son one day you’ll have to do the same\nI get emotional when I stop I think and I look around\nbeyond the county lines of my small town\nI think about all the men out there who feel like I do now \nWho are screaming on the inside but won’t ever make a sound\n \nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not bout how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nDon’t give up, keep fightin’\nAs a man our son(sun) is our horizon\nAnd our father’s actions play a role\nAnd we end up like ‘em\nSo they can’t let us see them hurt\n‘Cause we’ll embody what they do\nAnd start a generational curse\n No wonder most men are so depressed\nAll the things that they can’t express\nThey go to war \nget thrown on the shelf\nThen go back to war with their mental health\nThen grab that bottle and ask for help\nTry to pull themselves out of h*ll\nThen fall back down and then realize that they gon’ have to do it themselves\n \nIt’s the circle of life\nAs a man you provide\nThey don’t know what you’re worth ‘til the day that you die\nAnd that’s when they start cryin’\nThen move on to a man to confide in\n \nThat’s why we feel\nWe can’t hide ourselves\nWe don’t expect you to understand\nWe just hope we can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and you don’t care about what we know\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n \nThat home\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. This is the most excited I've ever felt about a collab. It was absolutely legendary to work with Darius Rucker.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread and create healthy conversation. 2023 IS NOT OVER!! SO MUCH MORE ON THE WAY!!! I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout life. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world. Much love! This is MUSIC FOR THE PEOPLE!!!",

                "description": "[LYRICS BELOW] \"To Be a Man\" is making an IMPACT. I truly believe there are millions more to touch with this song. I travelled to Nashville to complete this and had the pleasure of working with the legend Darius Rucker. I'm still in shock. Share this with everyone and anyone and let's make an impact with music FOR THE PEOPLE spread BY THE PEOPLE. Somebody out there needs this. Love y'all...Thank you. \n\nClick here to listen:\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/tbam\n\n\nFollow DAX: @thatsdax\nDirected by: Logan Meis \nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#ToBeAMan #Dax #Dariusrucker #masculinity #manhood #manosphere #masculine #men #traditionalman #remix \n\n\nLyrics:\n\nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road, and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not about how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nBeing a man is what you make it\nyou can’t always live up to expectations\nYou try to please everybody while you struggle so you fake it and end up out of balance compromising situations \nAs a good man\nA do what he should man\nA give everything he has and do everything he could man\nYou might find yourself feeling all alone\nInside a house you built that you don’t recognize as home\nAnd that’s what my daddy told me\nAnd i’ll tell my son the same\nNow that I’m older I relate and I actually feel his pain\nHe never cried\nHe might of lied but he did not complain \nAnd he said son one day you’ll have to do the same\nI get emotional when I stop I think and I look around\nbeyond the county lines of my small town\nI think about all the men out there who feel like I do now \nWho are screaming on the inside but won’t ever make a sound\n \nI can’t hide myself\nI don’t expect you to understand\nI just hope I can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and they don’t care about what you know\nIt’s not bout how you feel but what you provide inside that home\n \nDon’t give up, keep fightin’\nAs a man our son(sun) is our horizon\nAnd our father’s actions play a role\nAnd we end up like ‘em\nSo they can’t let us see them hurt\n‘Cause we’ll embody what they do\nAnd start a generational curse\n No wonder most men are so depressed\nAll the things that they can’t express\nThey go to war \nget thrown on the shelf\nThen go back to war with their mental health\nThen grab that bottle and ask for help\nTry to pull themselves out of h*ll\nThen fall back down and then realize that they gon’ have to do it themselves\n \nIt’s the circle of life\nAs a man you provide\nThey don’t know what you’re worth ‘til the day that you die\nAnd that’s when they start cryin’\nThen move on to a man to confide in\n \nThat’s why we feel\nWe can’t hide ourselves\nWe don’t expect you to understand\nWe just hope we can explain\nWhat it’s like to be a man\nIt’s a lonely road and you don’t care about what we know\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n \nThat home\nIt’s not about how we feel but what we provide inside that home\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you made it this deep you are a real one. This is the most excited I've ever felt about a collab. It was absolutely legendary to work with Darius Rucker.  Thank you all for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an IMPACT! All the support is appreciated and not taken for granted. I'm excited to go to war with this one and watch it spread and create healthy conversation. 2023 IS NOT OVER!! SO MUCH MORE ON THE WAY!!! I promise to continue to put my all into creating pieces of work we can all be proud of and carry throughout life. LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE and let's continue to spark minds and be the change we wish to see in the world. Much love! This is MUSIC FOR THE PEOPLE!!!"
