ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #unFolded #OfficialAcapellaVideo",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #unFolded #OfficialAcapellaVideo"

A Music City native, the rising star began his career by blazing an independent trail, leveraging an infectious country-or-nothing personality, rowdy live performances, and authentic music built around his low-slung vocal twang. Amassing 1 BILLION+ global career streams (with more than 350 MILLION global streams on his first RIAA PLATINUM-certified smash, “County Line”), Matthew has garnered over 1.5 MILLION followers across social media; named “One to Watch” by HITS; Opry NextStage Class of 2024; and among MusicRow’s Next Big Thing Class of 2024; in addition to being nominated at the 2024 People’s Choice Country Awards. The in-demand emerging talent recently hit Top 5 with GOLD-certified debut single “Love You Again,” after releasing back-to-back collaborations with Flo Rida (“Floats Your Boat”) and Fernando & Sorocaba (“Cold Blooded”), following his latest EP, Always Be Mine. Selling out venues across the nation on his U.S. headline COME GET YOUR MEMORY TOUR and EXTENDED trek, he’s next in Canada after last supporting Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean.\n\n© 2025 Chase Matthew Music / Warner Music Nashville LLC\n\n#ChaseMatthew #DontLeaveJoleneRemix #CountryMusic",

A Music City native, the rising star began his career by blazing an independent trail, leveraging an infectious country-or-nothing personality, rowdy live performances, and authentic music built around his low-slung vocal twang. Amassing 1 BILLION+ global career streams (with more than 350 MILLION global streams on his first RIAA PLATINUM-certified smash, “County Line”), Matthew has garnered over 1.5 MILLION followers across social media; named “One to Watch” by HITS; Opry NextStage Class of 2024; and among MusicRow’s Next Big Thing Class of 2024; in addition to being nominated at the 2024 People’s Choice Country Awards. The in-demand emerging talent recently hit Top 5 with GOLD-certified debut single “Love You Again,” after releasing back-to-back collaborations with Flo Rida (“Floats Your Boat”) and Fernando & Sorocaba (“Cold Blooded”), following his latest EP, Always Be Mine. Selling out venues across the nation on his U.S. headline COME GET YOUR MEMORY TOUR and EXTENDED trek, he’s next in Canada after last supporting Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean.\n\n© 2025 Chase Matthew Music / Warner Music Nashville LLC\n\n#ChaseMatthew #DontLeaveJoleneRemix #CountryMusic"

We've got baccarat, we've got slots, we've got even more slots, and some roulette too.  It's time to see if we can get a massive hand pay.  Thank you all so much for liking, subscribing, and dropping your thoughts in the comments. Even if you’re roasting me—I still love you. You’re all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war.\n\nBrettski and Bluff walked through the casino doors like outlaws entering a saloon. The plan was simple: start with $10,000, play smart, and maybe—just maybe—walk out legends.\n\nThey hit the high-limit room first. Brettski sat at a $100 blackjack table, Bluff drifted toward the slots, eyes locked on a glimmering machine called Dragon's Vault. Within minutes, Brettski caught fire—blackjack after blackjack. He stacked chips so high, even the pit boss raised an eyebrow. Bluff, meanwhile, hit a mini jackpot on his third spin: $4,200. They met back up, high-fived, and doubled down.\n\nFeeling invincible, Brettski suggested roulette. Bluff grinned. “Let’s go red until we can’t feel feelings.” They threw $5,000 on red. Ball spun. Landed on green. A gasp. The air changed. Bluff laughed, but it sounded hollow.\n\nChasing the loss, they found a progressive slot near the cashier cage called Pharaoh’s Curse. Jackpot over a million. Bluff said, “This is it.” They pooled the last of their winnings: $6,700 into one final push.\n\nSpin after spin, nothing. Then, on a random $125 bet, the reels lit up. Bonus round. Brettski and Bluff held their breath. The screen flashed: “Enter the Tomb for a chance at the Grand Prize.” A pyramid appeared. Three doors.\n\n“Pick one,” Bluff whispered.\n\nBrettski hovered over the screen… picked the middle door.\n\nThe animation dragged. Smoke. Symbols. A golden sarcophagus opened—\n\nSuddenly, the machine froze.\n\nLights dimmed. Alarms rang. Not jackpot alarms—security alarms.\n\nA voice came over the loudspeaker: “Attention guests, please remain where you are. The casino is on temporary lockdown.”\n\nBrettski turned to Bluff. “What the hell is happening?”\n\nBluff stared at the frozen screen.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, the machine whispered a single word:\n\n“Run.”\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination.",

Landed on green. A gasp. The air changed. Bluff laughed, but it sounded hollow.\n\nChasing the loss, they found a progressive slot near the cashier cage called Pharaoh’s Curse. Jackpot over a million. Bluff said, “This is it.” They pooled the last of their winnings: $6,700 into one final push.\n\nSpin after spin, nothing. Then, on a random $125 bet, the reels lit up. Bonus round. Brettski and Bluff held their breath. The screen flashed: “Enter the Tomb for a chance at the Grand Prize.” A pyramid appeared. Three doors.\n\n“Pick one,” Bluff whispered.\n\nBrettski hovered over the screen… picked the middle door.\n\nThe animation dragged. Smoke. Symbols. A golden sarcophagus opened—\n\nSuddenly, the machine froze.\n\nLights dimmed. Alarms rang. Not jackpot alarms—security alarms.\n\nA voice came over the loudspeaker: “Attention guests, please remain where you are. The casino is on temporary lockdown.”\n\nBrettski turned to Bluff. “What the hell is happening?”\n\nBluff stared at the frozen screen.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, the machine whispered a single word:\n\n“Run.”\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski?

Tenemos bacará, tragamonedas, aún más tragamonedas, y también algo de ruleta. Es hora de ver si conseguimos un premio gordo. Muchísimas gracias a todos por darle a \"me gusta\", suscribirse y dejar sus opiniones en los comentarios. Aunque me estén tomando el pelo, los sigo queriendo. Son todos preciosos, y de verdad les agradezco a todos por acompañarme en este viaje tan loco. ¡Deséenme suerte y nos vemos en la próxima! ¡Vamos a la guerra!\n\nBrettski y Bluff entraron por las puertas del casino como forajidos en una cantina. El plan era simple: empezar con 10.000 $, jugar con inteligencia y, quizás, solo quizás, salir como leyendas.\n\nPrimeros en llegar a la sala de límite alto. Brettski estaba sentado en una mesa de blackjack de $100, Bluff se dirigió a las tragamonedas, con la mirada fija en una máquina reluciente llamada Dragon's Vault. En cuestión de minutos, Brettski se encendió, blackjack tras blackjack. Apiló tantas fichas que incluso el jefe de sala arqueó una ceja. Bluff, mientras tanto, ganó un mini jackpot en su tercer giro: $4,200. Volvieron a encontrarse, chocaron las cinco y doblaron la apuesta.\n\nSintiéndose invencible, Brettski sugirió la ruleta. Bluff sonrió. \"Juguemos al rojo hasta que no podamos sentir emociones\". Apostaron $5,000 al rojo. La bola giró. Cayó en verde. Un jadeo. El ambiente cambió. Bluff rió, pero sonó hueco.\n\nPersiguiendo la pérdida, encontraron una tragamonedas progresiva cerca de la caja llamada Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot de más de un millón. Bluff dijo: \"Esto es todo\". Juntaron sus últimas ganancias: $6,700 en un último empujón.\n\nGiro tras giro, nada. Entonces, con una apuesta aleatoria de $125, los rodillos se iluminaron. Ronda de bonificación. Brettski y Bluff contuvieron la respiración. La pantalla mostró: \"Entra en la Tumba para tener la oportunidad de ganar el Gran Premio\". Apareció una pirámide. Tres puertas.\n\n\"Elige una\", susurró Bluff.\n\nBrettski se quedó flotando sobre la pantalla... eligió la puerta del medio.\n\nLa animación se alargó. Humo. Símbolos. Un sarcófago dorado se abrió...\n\nDe repente, la máquina se congeló.\n\nLas luces se atenuaron. Sonaron las alarmas. No alarmas del bote, sino alarmas de seguridad.\n\nUna voz se escuchó por el altavoz: \"Atención, clientes, por favor, quédense donde están. El casino está temporalmente cerrado\".\n\nBrettski se giró hacia Bluff. \"¿Qué demonios está pasando?\".\n\nBluff miró fijamente la pantalla congelada.\n\nY entonces, de repente, la máquina susurró una sola palabra:\n\n\"Corre\".\n\n#tragamonedas #blackjack #juegos #casino #bacará #ruleta\n\n¿Quién es Brettski?

Grazie mille a tutti per aver messo \"Mi piace\", per esservi iscritti e per aver lasciato i vostri pensieri nei commenti. Anche se mi state prendendo in giro, vi amo comunque.

Il piano era semplice: iniziare con 10.000 dollari, giocare d'astuzia e forse, solo forse, uscirne da leggende.\n\nPrima si recarono nella sala con limiti alti. Brettski era seduto a un tavolo da blackjack da 100 dollari, Bluff si dirigeva verso le slot machine, con gli occhi fissi su una macchina scintillante chiamata Dragon's Vault. Nel giro di pochi minuti, Brettski prese fuoco, blackjack dopo blackjack. Impilò fiches così alte che persino il direttore di sala alzò un sopracciglio. Bluff, nel frattempo, vinse un mini jackpot al terzo giro: 4.200 dollari. Si incontrarono di nuovo, si diedero il cinque e raddoppiarono.\n\nSentendosi invincibile, Brettski suggerì la roulette. Bluff sorrise. \"Puntiamo sul rosso finché non riusciremo più a provare emozioni\". Puntarono 5.000 dollari sul rosso. La pallina girò. Atterrò sul verde. Un sussulto. L'aria cambiò. Bluff rise, ma la sua risata suonò vuota.\n\nInseguendo la perdita, trovarono una slot machine progressiva vicino alla cassa chiamata Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot oltre un milione. Bluff disse: \"Ci siamo\". Mettono insieme le ultime vincite: 6.700 dollari in un'ultima spinta.\n\nGiro dopo giro, niente. Poi, con una puntata casuale di 125 dollari, i rulli si illuminarono. Round bonus. Brettski e Bluff trattennero il respiro. Lo schermo lampeggiò: \"Entrate nella Tomba per avere la possibilità di vincere il Gran Premio\". Apparve una piramide. Tre porte.\n\n\"Sceglietene una\", sussurrò Bluff.\n\nBrettski si sollevò sullo schermo... scelse la porta centrale.\n\nL'animazione si trascinò. Fumo. Simboli. Un sarcofago dorato si aprì...\n\nImprovvisamente, la macchina si bloccò.\n\nLe luci si abbassarono. Suonarono gli allarmi. Non allarmi jackpot, allarmi di sicurezza.\n\nUna voce risuonò dall'altoparlante: \"Attenzione ospiti, siete pregati di rimanere dove siete. Il casinò è temporaneamente chiuso\".\n\nBrettski si rivolse a Bluff. \"Che diavolo sta succedendo?\"\n\nBluff fissò lo schermo bloccato.\n\nE poi, dal nulla, la macchina sussurrò una sola parola:\n\n\"Scappate\".\n\n#slot #blackjack #gioco d'azzardo #casinò #baccarat #roulette\n\nChi è Brettski?

Mamy bakarata, mamy sloty, mamy jeszcze więcej slotów, a także trochę ruletki. Czas sprawdzić, czy uda nam się zdobyć ogromną wygraną. Dziękuję wam wszystkim za polubienia, subskrypcje i dzielenie się swoimi przemyśleniami w komentarzach. Nawet jeśli mnie krytykujecie, nadal was kocham. Jesteście wszyscy piękni i naprawdę doceniam każdego z was za to, że towarzyszycie mi w tej szalonej podróży. Życzcie mi powodzenia i do zobaczenia w następnym odcinku! Chodźmy na wojnę.\n\nBrettski i Bluff przekroczyli drzwi kasyna niczym bandyci wchodzący do saloonu. Plan był prosty: zacząć z 10 000 dolarów, grać mądrze i może – tylko może – wyjść jako legendy.\n\nNajpierw trafili do pokoju z wysokimi limitami. Brettski siedział przy stole do blackjacka za 100 dolarów, a Bluff ruszył w stronę automatów, wpatrując się w lśniącą maszynę o nazwie Dragon's Vault. W ciągu kilku minut Brettski rozpalił się – blackjack za blackjackiem. Układał żetony tak wysoko, że nawet szef sali uniósł brwi. Tymczasem Bluff trafił mini jackpota w trzecim obrocie: 4200 dolarów. Spotkali się ponownie, przybili piątki i podwoili stawkę.\n\nCzując się niezwyciężonym, Brettski zaproponował ruletkę. Bluff uśmiechnął się szeroko. „Grajmy na czerwono, aż przestaniemy czuć emocje”. Rzucili 5000 dolarów na czerwone. Kulka zakręciła. Wylądowała na zielonym. Westchnienie. Atmosfera się zmieniła. Bluff zaśmiał się, ale zabrzmiało to pusto.\n\nGoniąc stratę, znaleźli automat z progresywnymi jackpotami w pobliżu kasy o nazwie Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot ponad milion. Bluff powiedział: „To jest to”. Złożyli ostatnią wygraną: 6700 dolarów, w jedną, ostatnią rundę.\n\nSpin za spinem, nic. Potem, przy losowym zakładzie 125 dolarów, bębny się rozświetliły. Runda bonusowa. Brettski i Bluff wstrzymali oddech. Ekran błysnął: „Wejdź do Grobowca, aby mieć szansę na wygranie nagrody głównej”. Pojawiła się piramida. Troje drzwi.\n\n„Wybierz jedno” – wyszeptał Bluff.\n\nBrettski zawisł nad ekranem… wybrał środkowe drzwi.\n\nAnimacja się przeciągnęła. Dym. Symbole. Otworzył się złoty sarkofag…\n\nNagle maszyna się zatrzymała.\n\nŚwiatła przygasły. Zadzwonił alarm. Nie alarm jackpota, tylko alarm bezpieczeństwa.\n\nZ głośnika dobiegł głos: „Uwaga, goście, proszę pozostać na swoich miejscach. Kasyno jest tymczasowo zamknięte”.\n\nBrettski odwrócił się do Bluffa. „Co się, do cholery, dzieje?”\n\nBluff wpatrywał się w zamrożony ekran.\n\nA potem, zupełnie niespodziewanie, maszyna wyszeptała jedno słowo:\n\n„Uciekaj”.\n\n#sloty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski?

Het plan was simpel: beginnen met $10.000, slim spelen en misschien – heel misschien – als legendes naar buiten komen.\n\nZe gaan als eerste naar de high-limit room. Brettski zat aan een blackjacktafel van $100, Bluff dwaalde naar de gokkasten, zijn ogen gericht op een glinsterende machine genaamd Dragon's Vault. Binnen enkele minuten vatte Brettski vuur – blackjack na blackjack. Hij stapelde zo hoog dat zelfs de pitboss een wenkbrauw optrok. Bluff won ondertussen een minijackpot bij zijn derde draai: $4200.

Bluff lachte, maar het klonk hol.\n\nOp zoek naar hun verlies vonden ze een progressieve gokkast vlak bij de kassa, genaamd Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot meer dan een miljoen. Bluff zei: \"Dit is hem.\" Ze legden hun laatste winst: $ 6.700 in één laatste poging.\n\nSpin na spin, niets. Toen, met een willekeurige inzet van $ 125, lichtten de rollen op. Bonusronde. Brettski en Bluff hielden hun adem in. Het scherm flitste: \"Betreed de Tombe voor een kans op de Hoofdprijs.\" Er verscheen een piramide. Drie deuren.\n\n\"Kies er één,\" fluisterde Bluff.\n\nBrettski zweefde boven het scherm... koos de middelste deur.\n\nDe animatie sleepte. Rook. Symbolen. Een gouden sarcofaag ging open—\n\nPlotseling bevroor de machine.\n\nDe lichten dimden. Alarmen gingen af. Geen jackpotalarmen, maar beveiligingsalarmen.\n\nEen stem klonk door de luidspreker: \"Attentie gasten, blijf alstublieft waar u bent. Het casino is tijdelijk afgesloten.\"\n\nBrettski draaide zich om naar Bluff. \"Wat is er in vredesnaam aan de hand?\"\n\nBluff staarde naar het bevroren scherm.\n\nEn toen, uit het niets, fluisterde de machine een enkel woord:\n\n\"Rennen.\"\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski? Brettski is een professionele gokker, vergelijkbaar met de oude legendes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay of Lady Luck HQ! In tegenstelling tot deze legendes beschikt Brettski echter over duizenden jaren aan opgeslagen oude kennis, verzameld door de ouderen, over vaardigheden zoals gokautomaten, roulette, blackjack, craps, bubble craps, poker en baccarat. Brettski's doel als professionele gokker is simpel: heel Las Vegas veroveren met geld dat is verdiend met gokken. Abonneer je om zijn reis naar wereldheerschappij te steunen."

Wir haben Baccarat, wir haben Spielautomaten, wir haben noch mehr Spielautomaten und auch etwas Roulette. Es ist Zeit zu sehen, ob wir einen riesigen Gewinn einfahren können. Vielen Dank an alle fürs Liken, Abonnieren und eure Kommentare. Auch wenn ihr mich aufzieht – ich liebe euch trotzdem. Ihr seid alle wunderbar, und ich schätze jeden einzelnen von euch sehr, dass ihr diese verrückte Reise mitgemacht habt. Wünscht mir Glück, wir sehen uns beim nächsten Mal! Auf in den Krieg!\n\nBrettski und Bluff marschierten durch die Casinotüren wie Gesetzlose in einen Saloon. Der Plan war einfach: Mit 10.000 Dollar starten, clever spielen und vielleicht – nur vielleicht – als Legenden wieder rausgehen.\n\nSie gingen zuerst in den High-Limit-Raum. Brettski saß an einem 100-Dollar-Blackjack-Tisch, Bluff schlenderte zu den Spielautomaten, den Blick auf einen schimmernden Automaten namens Dragon's Vault gerichtet. Innerhalb weniger Minuten fing Brettski Feuer – ein Blackjack nach dem anderen. Er stapelte so viele Chips, dass sogar der Pit Boss eine Augenbraue hochzog. Bluff knackte derweil bei seinem dritten Dreh einen Mini-Jackpot: 4.200 Dollar. Sie trafen sich wieder, klatschten ab und verdoppelten.\n\nBrettski fühlte sich unbesiegbar und schlug Roulette vor. Bluff grinste. „Lass uns auf Rot setzen, bis wir keine Gefühle mehr haben.“ Sie setzten 5.000 Dollar auf Rot. Die Kugel drehte sich. Landete auf Grün. Ein Keuchen. Die Luft veränderte sich. Bluff lachte, aber es klang hohl.\n\nUm dem Verlust hinterherzujagen, fanden sie einen progressiven Spielautomaten in der Nähe des Kassenschalters namens Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot über eine Million. Bluff sagte: „Das ist er.“ Sie legten ihren letzten Gewinn zusammen: 6.700 Dollar für einen letzten Versuch.\n\nDrehung um Drehung, nichts. Dann, bei einem zufälligen Einsatz von 125 $, leuchteten die Walzen auf. Bonusrunde. Brettski und Bluff hielten den Atem an. Der Bildschirm blitzte auf: „Betretet die Gruft und gewinnt den Hauptpreis.“ Eine Pyramide erschien. Drei Türen.\n\n„Wählt eine“, flüsterte Bluff.\n\nBrettski schwebte über dem Bildschirm … wählte die mittlere Tür.\n\nDie Animation zog sich in die Länge. Rauch. Symbole. Ein goldener Sarkophag öffnete sich –\n\nPlötzlich fror der Automat ein.\n\nDie Lichter wurden gedimmt. Alarme läuteten. Keine Jackpot-Alarme – Sicherheitsalarme.\n\nEine Stimme ertönte über den Lautsprecher: „Achtung, Gäste, bitte bleiben Sie, wo Sie sind. Das Casino ist vorübergehend gesperrt.“\n\nBrettski wandte sich an Bluff. „Was zum Teufel ist hier los?“\n\nBluff starrte auf den eingefrorenen Bildschirm.\n\nUnd dann, aus dem Nichts, flüsterte der Automat ein einziges Wort:\n\n„Lauft.“\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski? Brettski ist ein professioneller Spieler, ähnlich wie die alten Legenden Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay oder Lady Luck HQ!

                "description": "हम @Bluffinbob के साथ कैसीनो पर निशाना साधते हुए वापस आ गए हैं, यह देखने के लिए कि क्या हम इस व्लॉग के लिए कोई बड़ी जीत हासिल कर सकते हैं। हमारे पास बैकारेट है, हमारे पास स्लॉट हैं, हमारे पास और भी स्लॉट हैं, और कुछ रूलेट भी हैं। अब यह देखने का समय है कि क्या हम कोई बड़ा हैंड पे हासिल कर सकते हैं। लाइक करने, सब्सक्राइब करने और कमेंट्स में अपने विचार देने के लिए आप सभी का बहुत-बहुत शुक्रिया। भले ही आप मुझे ट्रोल कर रहे हों—मैं फिर भी आपसे प्यार करता हूँ। आप सभी खूबसूरत हैं, और इस रोमांचक सफ़र में साथ चलने के लिए मैं आप सभी का तहे दिल से शुक्रिया अदा करता हूँ। मुझे शुभकामनाएँ दें, और मैं आपसे अगले वीडियो में मिलूँगा! चलो जंग शुरू करते हैं।\n\nब्रेट्स्की और ब्लफ़ कैसीनो के दरवाज़ों से ऐसे अंदर गए जैसे कोई डाकू किसी सैलून में घुस रहा हो। योजना आसान थी: $10,000 से शुरुआत करें, समझदारी से खेलें, और शायद—बस शायद—लीजेंड बनकर बाहर निकलें।\n\nवे सबसे पहले हाई-लिमिट वाले कमरे में पहुँचे। ब्रेट्स्की $100 की ब्लैकजैक टेबल पर बैठा था, ब्लफ़ स्लॉट्स की ओर बढ़ रहा था, उसकी नज़र ड्रैगन्स वॉल्ट नाम की एक चमकती हुई मशीन पर टिकी थी। कुछ ही मिनटों में, ब्रेट्स्की में आग लग गई—एक के बाद एक ब्लैकजैक। उसने चिप्स इतने ऊँचे-ऊँचे लगाए कि पिट बॉस ने भी भौंहें चढ़ा दीं। इसी बीच, ब्लफ़ को अपने तीसरे स्पिन पर एक छोटा जैकपॉट मिला: $4,200। वे फिर मिले, हाई-फ़ाइव किया और डबल डाउन किया।\n\nखुद को अजेय महसूस करते हुए, ब्रेट्स्की ने रूलेट का सुझाव दिया। ब्लफ़ मुस्कुराया। \"चलो तब तक लाल खेलते हैं जब तक हमें एहसास न हो जाए।\" उन्होंने $5,000 लाल पर फेंके। गेंद घूमी। हरे पर गिरी। एक गहरी साँस। हवा बदल गई। ब्लफ़ हँसा, लेकिन उसकी आवाज़ खोखली लग रही थी।\n\nनुकसान का पीछा करते हुए, उन्हें कैशियर केज के पास एक प्रगतिशील स्लॉट मिला जिसका नाम था फिरौन का अभिशाप। दस लाख से ज़्यादा का जैकपॉट। ब्लफ़ ने कहा, \"बस यही है।\" उन्होंने अपनी आखिरी जीत: $6,700, एक आखिरी दांव में जमा कर दी।\n\nबार-बार घुमाने के बाद भी कुछ नहीं हुआ। फिर, एक बेतरतीब $125 के दांव पर, रीलें चमक उठीं। बोनस राउंड। ब्रेट्स्की और ब्लफ़ ने साँस रोक ली। स्क्रीन पर चमक उठी: \"महापुरस्कार जीतने के मौके के लिए मकबरे में प्रवेश करें।\" एक पिरामिड दिखाई दिया। तीन दरवाज़े।\n\n\"एक चुनो,\" ब्लफ़ फुसफुसाया।\n\nब्रेट्स्की स्क्रीन पर मँडरा रहा था... बीच वाला दरवाज़ा चुना।\n\nएनीमेशन धीमा हो गया। धुआँ। प्रतीक। एक सुनहरा ताबूत खुला—\n\nअचानक, मशीन जम गई।\n\nबत्ती धीमी हो गई। अलार्म बज उठे। जैकपॉट अलार्म नहीं—सुरक्षा अलार्म।\n\nलाउडस्पीकर पर एक आवाज़ आई: \"मेहमानों, कृपया जहाँ हैं वहीं रहें। कैसीनो अस्थायी रूप से बंद है।\"\n\nब्रेट्स्की ब्लफ़ की ओर मुड़ा। \"आखिर क्या हो रहा है?\"\n\nब्लफ़ जमी हुई स्क्रीन को घूर रहा था।\n\nऔर फिर, अचानक, मशीन ने फुसफुसाते हुए एक शब्द कहा:\n\n\"भागो।\"\n\n#स्लॉट #ब्लैकजैक #जुआ #कैसीनो #बैकारेट #रूलेट\n\nब्रेट्स्की कौन है? ब्रेट्स्की एक पेशेवर जुआरी है, जो वेगास मैट, ब्लफ़, डेगेनडाल्ट, मिस्टर हैंड पे या लेडी लक मुख्यालय जैसे प्राचीन दिग्गजों की तरह है! हालाँकि, इन दिग्गजों के विपरीत, ब्रेट्स्की के पास हज़ारों सालों का प्राचीन ज्ञान है जो बुजुर्गों ने इकट्ठा किया था, जिसमें स्लॉट मशीन, रूलेट, ब्लैकजैक, क्रेप्स, बबल क्रेप्स, पोकर और बैकारेट जैसे कौशल शामिल हैं। एक पेशेवर जुआरी के रूप में ब्रेट्स्की का लक्ष्य सरल है: जुए से कमाए गए धन का उपयोग करके पूरे लास वेगास पर कब्ज़ा करना। विश्व प्रभुत्व में उनके सफ़र का समर्थन करने के लिए सदस्यता लें।"

Kita punya bakarat, kita punya slot, kita punya lebih banyak slot, dan juga rolet. Saatnya untuk melihat apakah kita bisa mendapatkan bayaran besar.

Kalian semua cantik, dan aku sangat menghargai kalian semua yang telah ikut serta dalam perjalanan gila ini. Doakan aku beruntung, dan sampai jumpa di vlog berikutnya! Ayo berperang.\n\nBrettski dan Bluff berjalan melewati pintu kasino seperti penjahat yang memasuki bar. Rencananya sederhana: mulai dengan $10.000, bermain cerdas, dan mungkin—mungkin saja—keluar sebagai legenda.\n\nMereka mencapai ruang batas tinggi terlebih dahulu. Brettski duduk di meja blackjack seharga $100, Bluff melayang ke arah mesin slot, mata terpaku pada mesin berkilauan bernama Dragon's Vault. Dalam hitungan menit, Brettski langsung meledak—blackjack demi blackjack. Ia menumpuk chip begitu tinggi, bahkan bos pit mengangkat alisnya. Sementara itu, Bluff mendapatkan jackpot mini pada putaran ketiganya: $4.200. Mereka bertemu kembali, saling tos, dan menggandakan taruhan.\n\nMerasa tak terkalahkan, Brettski menyarankan roulette. Bluff menyeringai. \"Ayo kita pilih merah sampai kita tak bisa merasakan perasaan.\" Mereka melempar $5.000 ke merah. Bola berputar. Mendarat di hijau. Terkesiap. Suasana berubah. Bluff tertawa, tetapi terdengar hampa.\n\nMengejar kekalahan, mereka menemukan slot progresif di dekat kasir bernama Kutukan Firaun. Jackpot lebih dari satu juta. Bluff berkata, \"Ini dia.\" Mereka mengumpulkan sisa kemenangan mereka: $6.700 dalam satu dorongan terakhir.\n\nPutaran demi putaran, nihil. Kemudian, pada taruhan acak $125, gulungan menyala. Ronde bonus. Brettski dan Bluff menahan napas. Layar berkedip: \"Masuki Makam untuk kesempatan memenangkan Hadiah Utama.\" Sebuah piramida muncul. Tiga pintu.\n\n\"Pilih satu,\" bisik Bluff.\n\nBrettski melayang di atas layar... memilih pintu tengah.\n\nAnimasi tersendat. Asap. Simbol. Sebuah sarkofagus emas terbuka—\n\nTiba-tiba, mesin itu membeku.\n\nLampu meredup. Alarm berbunyi. Bukan alarm jackpot—alarm keamanan.\n\nSebuah suara terdengar dari pengeras suara: \"Perhatian para tamu, harap tetap di tempat. Kasino sedang ditutup sementara.\"\n\nBrettski menoleh ke Bluff. \"Apa yang terjadi?\"\n\nBluff menatap layar yang membeku.\n\nDan kemudian, entah dari mana, mesin itu membisikkan satu kata:\n\n\"Lari.\"\n\n#slot #blackjack #judi #kasino #bakarat #roulette\n\nSiapakah Brettski? Brettski adalah seorang Penjudi Profesional, mirip dengan legenda kuno Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay, atau Lady Luck HQ! Namun, tidak seperti legenda-legenda ini, Brettski memiliki pengetahuan kuno yang tersimpan selama ribuan tahun, yang dikumpulkan oleh para tetua, dalam keterampilan seperti Mesin Slot, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, dan Bakarat.
