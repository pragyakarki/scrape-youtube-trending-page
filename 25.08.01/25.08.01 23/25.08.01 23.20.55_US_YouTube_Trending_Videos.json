ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

                "description": "What Does It Take To Make A God In A Video Game.\n\nThe year is 2025 and with bethesda teasing a return to the world of oblivion gamers are once again searching for a taste of skyrim. With the oblivion remaster looking to be a remake that fleshes out some skyrim systems like stealth archer builds I thought it would be a good idea to dive into a new games spin on the RPG formula. This game is Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon. It has split news outlets with half saying it is an indie skyrim and half saying its indie dark souls. For me the spiffing brit this game is perfectly balanced. Remember this game is NOT SKYRIM but perhaps just like skyrim we can find infinite money glitches, overpowered magic and an array of silly physics moments. \n\nIf you are interested in the game you can grab it on steam sale here at some point: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/\n\nIt is described as follows: Step into a dark reimagination of Arthurian legends in this first person, open world RPG. Explore a world stuck in everlasting autumn, witness falling legends and make meaningful choices woven into a complex, branching storyline. SO yeah it does indeed hit all of the lovely buzzwords that todd howard used to draw me into the world of tamriel and skyrim all those years ago. So lets hunt for bugs, glitches and exploits in this open world adventure. \n\nChapters:\n00:00 An ode to Bethesda\n01:52 I’m a Tod Get me Out of here\n04:37 Press Space to Continue \n06:38 Time to Level up\n07:59 But Just before I leave\n10:02 Land Ahoy\n11:28 Our First Challenge \n12:40 Breaking the economy \n15:09 Is this Sword Big enough?\n17:10 Knight duel 2 electric boogaloo \n18:10 When a man needs a spell\n19:47 This man is a Legend\n21:36 True British Tactics \n23:51 New Gear Who Dis?\n26:32 New Zone Where DIs?\n30:49 Gimmie Gimmie Ore\n31:32 Changing the Build\n34:33 Dungeon Diving\n38:00 True Power\n40:21 A Final Duel\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: THIS IS NOT SKYRIM 2 - BECOMING A GOD In Tainted Grail A PERFECTLY BALANCED GAME\n \nPrevious Video Here: https://youtu.be/yeO7LnbGxzE\n\n#rpg #gameplay #funny"
