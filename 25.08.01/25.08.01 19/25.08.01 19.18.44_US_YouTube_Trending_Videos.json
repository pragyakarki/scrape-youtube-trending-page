ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Southern Gotham\n\nI’m the one who still loves your ghost\nI reanimate your bones \nWith my belief\nAnd I’m the one who still loves your ghost\nI reanimate your bones \nCause I’m a true believer\n\nThey put up chainlink fences underneath the biggest bridges\nThey pose in Christmas cards with guns as big as all the children\nThey say that Jesus is the way but then they gave him a white face\nSo they don’t have to pray to someone they deem lesser than them\n\nThe South will not rise again\nTil it’s paid for every sin \nStrange fruit, hard bargain\nTill the roots, Southern Gotham\n\nI’m the one who still loves your ghost\nI reanimate your bones \nWith my belief\nAnd I’m the one who still loves your ghost\nI reanimate your bones \nCause I’m a true believer\n\nI’m the one who still loves your ghost\nI reanimate your bones \nWith my belief\nAnd I’m the one who still loves your ghost\nI reanimate your bones \nCause I’m a true believer\n\n#HayleyWilliams #TrueBeliever"

                "description": "What Does It Take To Make A God In A Video Game.\n\nThe year is 2025 and with bethesda teasing a return to the world of oblivion gamers are once again searching for a taste of skyrim. With the oblivion remaster looking to be a remake that fleshes out some skyrim systems like stealth archer builds I thought it would be a good idea to dive into a new games spin on the RPG formula. This game is Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon. It has split news outlets with half saying it is an indie skyrim and half saying its indie dark souls. For me the spiffing brit this game is perfectly balanced. Remember this game is NOT SKYRIM but perhaps just like skyrim we can find infinite money glitches, overpowered magic and an array of silly physics moments. \n\nIf you are interested in the game you can grab it on steam sale here at some point: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/\n\nIt is described as follows: Step into a dark reimagination of Arthurian legends in this first person, open world RPG. Explore a world stuck in everlasting autumn, witness falling legends and make meaningful choices woven into a complex, branching storyline. SO yeah it does indeed hit all of the lovely buzzwords that todd howard used to draw me into the world of tamriel and skyrim all those years ago. So lets hunt for bugs, glitches and exploits in this open world adventure. \n\nChapters:\n00:00 An ode to Bethesda\n01:52 I’m a Tod Get me Out of here\n04:37 Press Space to Continue \n06:38 Time to Level up\n07:59 But Just before I leave\n10:02 Land Ahoy\n11:28 Our First Challenge \n12:40 Breaking the economy \n15:09 Is this Sword Big enough?\n17:10 Knight duel 2 electric boogaloo \n18:10 When a man needs a spell\n19:47 This man is a Legend\n21:36 True British Tactics \n23:51 New Gear Who Dis?\n26:32 New Zone Where DIs?\n30:49 Gimmie Gimmie Ore\n31:32 Changing the Build\n34:33 Dungeon Diving\n38:00 True Power\n40:21 A Final Duel\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: THIS IS NOT SKYRIM 2 - BECOMING A GOD In Tainted Grail A PERFECTLY BALANCED GAME\n \nPrevious Video Here: https://youtu.be/yeO7LnbGxzE\n\n#rpg #gameplay #funny"

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #unFolded #OfficialAcapellaVideo",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #unFolded #OfficialAcapellaVideo"

Brettski était assis à une table de blackjack à 100 $, tandis que Bluff se dirigeait vers les machines à sous, les yeux rivés sur une machine scintillante appelée Dragon's Vault. En quelques minutes, Brettski s'enflamma, blackjack après blackjack. Il empila des jetons si haut que même le chef de table haussa un sourcil. Bluff, quant à lui, décrocha un mini jackpot à son troisième tour : 4 200 $. Ils se retrouvèrent, se tapèrent dans la main et doublèrent leur mise.\n\nSe sentant invincible, Brettski suggéra la roulette. Bluff sourit. « On joue au rouge jusqu'à ce qu'on ne ressente plus rien. » Ils mirent 5 000 $ sur le rouge. La bille tourna. Elle atterrit sur le vert. Un halètement. L'air changea. Bluff rit, mais son rire sonna creux.\n\nPoursuivant leur perte, ils trouvèrent une machine à sous progressive près de la caisse, appelée Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot supérieur au million. Bluff dit : « Ça y est. » Ils mirent en commun leurs derniers gains : 6 700 $ dans une ultime tentative.\n\nTour après tour, rien. Puis, suite à une mise aléatoire de 125 $, les rouleaux s’illuminèrent. Tour bonus. Brettski et Bluff retinrent leur souffle.

Trois portes.\n\n« Choisissez-en une », chuchota Bluff.\n\nBrettski plana au-dessus de l’écran… choisit la porte du milieu.\n\nL’animation traîna. De la fumée. Des symboles. Un sarcophage doré s’ouvrit…\n\nSoudain, la machine se figea.\n\nLes lumières s’éteignirent. Des alarmes retentirent. Pas des alarmes de jackpot, mais des alarmes de sécurité.\n\nUne voix retentit dans le haut-parleur : « Attention, clients, veuillez rester où vous êtes. Le casino est temporairement fermé. »\n\nBrettski se tourna vers Bluff. « Que diable se passe-t-il ? »\n\nBluff fixa l’écran figé.\n\nEt puis, soudain, la machine murmura un seul mot :\n\n« Courez ! »\n\n#machines à sous #blackjack #jeux d'argent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ?

Temos bacará, caça-níqueis, ainda mais caça-níqueis e roleta também. É hora de ver se conseguimos um pagamento alto. Muito obrigado a todos por curtirem, se inscreverem e deixarem suas opiniões nos comentários. Mesmo que estejam me provocando, eu ainda amo vocês. Vocês são todos lindos, e eu realmente aprecio cada um de vocês por embarcarem nessa jornada maluca. Me desejem sorte e nos vemos na próxima! Vamos à guerra.\n\nBrettski e Bluff atravessaram as portas do cassino como bandidos entrando em um bar. O plano era simples: começar com US$ 10.000, jogar com inteligência e talvez — só talvez — saírem como lendas.\n\nEles chegaram primeiro à sala de limite alto. Brettski sentou-se a uma mesa de blackjack de US$ 100, Bluff foi em direção aos caça-níqueis, com os olhos fixos em uma máquina reluzente chamada Dragon's Vault. Em poucos minutos, Brettski pegou fogo — blackjack após blackjack. Ele acumulou fichas tão altas que até o chefe do cassino levantou uma sobrancelha. Bluff, por sua vez, acertou um mini jackpot em sua terceira rodada: US$ 4.200. Eles se encontraram novamente, bateram palmas e dobraram a aposta.\n\nSentindo-se invencível, Brettski sugeriu roleta. Bluff sorriu. \"Vamos apostar no vermelho até não sentirmos mais sentimentos.\" Eles apostaram US$ 5.000 no vermelho. A bola girou. Caiu no verde. Um suspiro. O ar mudou. Bluff riu, mas soou vazio.\n\nPerseguindo a perda, eles encontraram uma máquina caça-níqueis progressiva perto do caixa chamada Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot de mais de um milhão. Bluff disse: \"É isso aí.\" Eles juntaram o que restava de seus ganhos: US$ 6.700 em uma última tentativa.\n\nGiro após giro, nada. Então, em uma aposta aleatória de US$ 125, os rolos se iluminaram. Rodada bônus. Brettski e Bluff prenderam a respiração. A tela piscou: \"Entre na Tumba para concorrer ao Grande Prêmio.\" Uma pirâmide apareceu. Três portas.\n\n\"Escolha uma\", sussurrou Bluff.\n\nBrettski pairou sobre a tela... escolheu a porta do meio.\n\nA animação se arrastou. Fumaça. Símbolos. Um sarcófago dourado se abriu...\n\nDe repente, a máquina congelou.\n\nAs luzes diminuíram. Os alarmes tocaram. Não alarmes de jackpot, mas alarmes de segurança.\n\nUma voz soou pelo alto-falante: \"Atenção, hóspedes, por favor, permaneçam onde estão. O cassino está temporariamente fechado.\"\n\nBrettski se virou para Bluff. \"Que diabos está acontecendo?\"\n\nBluff olhou para a tela congelada.\n\nE então, do nada, a máquina sussurrou uma única palavra:\n\n\"Corra.\"\n\n#caça-níqueis #blackjack #jogos de azar #cassino #bacará #roleta\n\nQuem é Brettski?

We hebben baccarat, gokkasten, nog meer gokkasten en ook nog wat roulette. Het is tijd om te kijken of we een flinke hand kunnen winnen. Heel erg bedankt allemaal voor het liken, abonneren en het achterlaten van jullie mening in de reacties. Zelfs als jullie me belachelijk maken, hou ik nog steeds van jullie. Jullie zijn allemaal prachtig, en ik waardeer het enorm dat jullie allemaal mee hebben gedaan aan deze waanzinnige reis. Wens me succes en ik zie jullie in de volgende! Laten we ten strijde trekken.\n\nBrettski en Bluff liepen door de casinodeuren als criminelen die een saloon binnengaan. Het plan was simpel: beginnen met $10.000, slim spelen en misschien – heel misschien – als legendes naar buiten komen.\n\nZe gaan als eerste naar de high-limit room. Brettski zat aan een blackjacktafel van $100, Bluff dwaalde naar de gokkasten, zijn ogen gericht op een glinsterende machine genaamd Dragon's Vault. Binnen enkele minuten vatte Brettski vuur – blackjack na blackjack. Hij stapelde zo hoog dat zelfs de pitboss een wenkbrauw optrok. Bluff won ondertussen een minijackpot bij zijn derde draai: $4200. Ze ontmoetten elkaar weer, gaven elkaar een high five en verdubbelden.\n\nZich onoverwinnelijk voelend, stelde Brettski roulette voor. Bluff grijnsde. \"Laten we rood spelen tot we geen gevoelens meer kunnen voelen.\" Ze gooiden $5000 op rood. De bal draaide. Landde op groen. Een zucht. De lucht veranderde. Bluff lachte, maar het klonk hol.\n\nOp zoek naar hun verlies vonden ze een progressieve gokkast vlak bij de kassa, genaamd Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot meer dan een miljoen. Bluff zei: \"Dit is hem.\" Ze legden hun laatste winst: $ 6.700 in één laatste poging.\n\nSpin na spin, niets. Toen, met een willekeurige inzet van $ 125, lichtten de rollen op. Bonusronde. Brettski en Bluff hielden hun adem in. Het scherm flitste: \"Betreed de Tombe voor een kans op de Hoofdprijs.\" Er verscheen een piramide. Drie deuren.\n\n\"Kies er één,\" fluisterde Bluff.\n\nBrettski zweefde boven het scherm... koos de middelste deur.\n\nDe animatie sleepte. Rook. Symbolen. Een gouden sarcofaag ging open—\n\nPlotseling bevroor de machine.\n\nDe lichten dimden. Alarmen gingen af. Geen jackpotalarmen, maar beveiligingsalarmen.\n\nEen stem klonk door de luidspreker: \"Attentie gasten, blijf alstublieft waar u bent. Het casino is tijdelijk afgesloten.\"\n\nBrettski draaide zich om naar Bluff. \"Wat is er in vredesnaam aan de hand?\"\n\nBluff staarde naar het bevroren scherm.\n\nEn toen, uit het niets, fluisterde de machine een enkel woord:\n\n\"Rennen.\"\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski? Brettski is een professionele gokker, vergelijkbaar met de oude legendes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay of Lady Luck HQ! In tegenstelling tot deze legendes beschikt Brettski echter over duizenden jaren aan opgeslagen oude kennis, verzameld door de ouderen, over vaardigheden zoals gokautomaten, roulette, blackjack, craps, bubble craps, poker en baccarat. Brettski's doel als professionele gokker is simpel: heel Las Vegas veroveren met geld dat is verdiend met gokken. Abonneer je om zijn reis naar wereldheerschappij te steunen."

Brettski saß an einem 100-Dollar-Blackjack-Tisch, Bluff schlenderte zu den Spielautomaten, den Blick auf einen schimmernden Automaten namens Dragon's Vault gerichtet. Innerhalb weniger Minuten fing Brettski Feuer – ein Blackjack nach dem anderen. Er stapelte so viele Chips, dass sogar der Pit Boss eine Augenbraue hochzog. Bluff knackte derweil bei seinem dritten Dreh einen Mini-Jackpot: 4.200 Dollar. Sie trafen sich wieder, klatschten ab und verdoppelten.\n\nBrettski fühlte sich unbesiegbar und schlug Roulette vor. Bluff grinste. „Lass uns auf Rot setzen, bis wir keine Gefühle mehr haben.“ Sie setzten 5.000 Dollar auf Rot. Die Kugel drehte sich. Landete auf Grün. Ein Keuchen. Die Luft veränderte sich. Bluff lachte, aber es klang hohl.\n\nUm dem Verlust hinterherzujagen, fanden sie einen progressiven Spielautomaten in der Nähe des Kassenschalters namens Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot über eine Million. Bluff sagte: „Das ist er.“ Sie legten ihren letzten Gewinn zusammen: 6.700 Dollar für einen letzten Versuch.\n\nDrehung um Drehung, nichts. Dann, bei einem zufälligen Einsatz von 125 $, leuchteten die Walzen auf. Bonusrunde. Brettski und Bluff hielten den Atem an. Der Bildschirm blitzte auf: „Betretet die Gruft und gewinnt den Hauptpreis.“ Eine Pyramide erschien. Drei Türen.\n\n„Wählt eine“, flüsterte Bluff.\n\nBrettski schwebte über dem Bildschirm … wählte die mittlere Tür.\n\nDie Animation zog sich in die Länge. Rauch. Symbole. Ein goldener Sarkophag öffnete sich –\n\nPlötzlich fror der Automat ein.\n\nDie Lichter wurden gedimmt. Alarme läuteten. Keine Jackpot-Alarme – Sicherheitsalarme.\n\nEine Stimme ertönte über den Lautsprecher: „Achtung, Gäste, bitte bleiben Sie, wo Sie sind. Das Casino ist vorübergehend gesperrt.“\n\nBrettski wandte sich an Bluff. „Was zum Teufel ist hier los?“\n\nBluff starrte auf den eingefrorenen Bildschirm.\n\nUnd dann, aus dem Nichts, flüsterte der Automat ein einziges Wort:\n\n„Lauft.“\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski?

Brettski estaba sentado en una mesa de blackjack de $100, Bluff se dirigió a las tragamonedas, con la mirada fija en una máquina reluciente llamada Dragon's Vault. En cuestión de minutos, Brettski se encendió, blackjack tras blackjack. Apiló tantas fichas que incluso el jefe de sala arqueó una ceja. Bluff, mientras tanto, ganó un mini jackpot en su tercer giro: $4,200. Volvieron a encontrarse, chocaron las cinco y doblaron la apuesta.\n\nSintiéndose invencible, Brettski sugirió la ruleta. Bluff sonrió. \"Juguemos al rojo hasta que no podamos sentir emociones\". Apostaron $5,000 al rojo. La bola giró. Cayó en verde. Un jadeo. El ambiente cambió. Bluff rió, pero sonó hueco.\n\nPersiguiendo la pérdida, encontraron una tragamonedas progresiva cerca de la caja llamada Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot de más de un millón. Bluff dijo: \"Esto es todo\".

Tres puertas.\n\n\"Elige una\", susurró Bluff.\n\nBrettski se quedó flotando sobre la pantalla... eligió la puerta del medio.\n\nLa animación se alargó. Humo. Símbolos. Un sarcófago dorado se abrió...\n\nDe repente, la máquina se congeló.\n\nLas luces se atenuaron. Sonaron las alarmas. No alarmas del bote, sino alarmas de seguridad.\n\nUna voz se escuchó por el altavoz: \"Atención, clientes, por favor, quédense donde están.

Plan był prosty: zacząć z 10 000 dolarów, grać mądrze i może – tylko może – wyjść jako legendy.\n\nNajpierw trafili do pokoju z wysokimi limitami. Brettski siedział przy stole do blackjacka za 100 dolarów, a Bluff ruszył w stronę automatów, wpatrując się w lśniącą maszynę o nazwie Dragon's Vault. W ciągu kilku minut Brettski rozpalił się – blackjack za blackjackiem. Układał żetony tak wysoko, że nawet szef sali uniósł brwi. Tymczasem Bluff trafił mini jackpota w trzecim obrocie: 4200 dolarów. Spotkali się ponownie, przybili piątki i podwoili stawkę.\n\nCzując się niezwyciężonym, Brettski zaproponował ruletkę. Bluff uśmiechnął się szeroko. „Grajmy na czerwono, aż przestaniemy czuć emocje”. Rzucili 5000 dolarów na czerwone. Kulka zakręciła. Wylądowała na zielonym. Westchnienie. Atmosfera się zmieniła. Bluff zaśmiał się, ale zabrzmiało to pusto.\n\nGoniąc stratę, znaleźli automat z progresywnymi jackpotami w pobliżu kasy o nazwie Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot ponad milion. Bluff powiedział: „To jest to”. Złożyli ostatnią wygraną: 6700 dolarów, w jedną, ostatnią rundę.\n\nSpin za spinem, nic. Potem, przy losowym zakładzie 125 dolarów, bębny się rozświetliły. Runda bonusowa. Brettski i Bluff wstrzymali oddech. Ekran błysnął: „Wejdź do Grobowca, aby mieć szansę na wygranie nagrody głównej”. Pojawiła się piramida. Troje drzwi.\n\n„Wybierz jedno” – wyszeptał Bluff.\n\nBrettski zawisł nad ekranem… wybrał środkowe drzwi.\n\nAnimacja się przeciągnęła. Dym. Symbole. Otworzył się złoty sarkofag…\n\nNagle maszyna się zatrzymała.\n\nŚwiatła przygasły. Zadzwonił alarm. Nie alarm jackpota, tylko alarm bezpieczeństwa.\n\nZ głośnika dobiegł głos: „Uwaga, goście, proszę pozostać na swoich miejscach. Kasyno jest tymczasowo zamknięte”.\n\nBrettski odwrócił się do Bluffa. „Co się, do cholery, dzieje?”\n\nBluff wpatrywał się w zamrożony ekran.\n\nA potem, zupełnie niespodziewanie, maszyna wyszeptała jedno słowo:\n\n„Uciekaj”.\n\n#sloty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski?
