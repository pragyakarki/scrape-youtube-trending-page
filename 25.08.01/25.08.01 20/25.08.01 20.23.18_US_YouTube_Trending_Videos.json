ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."

                "description": "Wracamy z @Bluffinbobem, który atakuje kasyno, sprawdzając, czy uda nam się zdobyć ogromną wygraną na vlogu. Mamy bakarata, mamy sloty, mamy jeszcze więcej slotów, a także trochę ruletki. Czas sprawdzić, czy uda nam się zdobyć ogromną wygraną. Dziękuję wam wszystkim za polubienia, subskrypcje i dzielenie się swoimi przemyśleniami w komentarzach. Nawet jeśli mnie krytykujecie, nadal was kocham. Jesteście wszyscy piękni i naprawdę doceniam każdego z was za to, że towarzyszycie mi w tej szalonej podróży. Życzcie mi powodzenia i do zobaczenia w następnym odcinku! Chodźmy na wojnę.\n\nBrettski i Bluff przekroczyli drzwi kasyna niczym bandyci wchodzący do saloonu. Plan był prosty: zacząć z 10 000 dolarów, grać mądrze i może – tylko może – wyjść jako legendy.\n\nNajpierw trafili do pokoju z wysokimi limitami. Brettski siedział przy stole do blackjacka za 100 dolarów, a Bluff ruszył w stronę automatów, wpatrując się w lśniącą maszynę o nazwie Dragon's Vault. W ciągu kilku minut Brettski rozpalił się – blackjack za blackjackiem. Układał żetony tak wysoko, że nawet szef sali uniósł brwi. Tymczasem Bluff trafił mini jackpota w trzecim obrocie: 4200 dolarów. Spotkali się ponownie, przybili piątki i podwoili stawkę.\n\nCzując się niezwyciężonym, Brettski zaproponował ruletkę. Bluff uśmiechnął się szeroko. „Grajmy na czerwono, aż przestaniemy czuć emocje”. Rzucili 5000 dolarów na czerwone. Kulka zakręciła. Wylądowała na zielonym. Westchnienie. Atmosfera się zmieniła. Bluff zaśmiał się, ale zabrzmiało to pusto.\n\nGoniąc stratę, znaleźli automat z progresywnymi jackpotami w pobliżu kasy o nazwie Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot ponad milion. Bluff powiedział: „To jest to”. Złożyli ostatnią wygraną: 6700 dolarów, w jedną, ostatnią rundę.\n\nSpin za spinem, nic. Potem, przy losowym zakładzie 125 dolarów, bębny się rozświetliły. Runda bonusowa. Brettski i Bluff wstrzymali oddech. Ekran błysnął: „Wejdź do Grobowca, aby mieć szansę na wygranie nagrody głównej”. Pojawiła się piramida. Troje drzwi.\n\n„Wybierz jedno” – wyszeptał Bluff.\n\nBrettski zawisł nad ekranem… wybrał środkowe drzwi.\n\nAnimacja się przeciągnęła. Dym. Symbole. Otworzył się złoty sarkofag…\n\nNagle maszyna się zatrzymała.\n\nŚwiatła przygasły. Zadzwonił alarm. Nie alarm jackpota, tylko alarm bezpieczeństwa.\n\nZ głośnika dobiegł głos: „Uwaga, goście, proszę pozostać na swoich miejscach. Kasyno jest tymczasowo zamknięte”.\n\nBrettski odwrócił się do Bluffa. „Co się, do cholery, dzieje?”\n\nBluff wpatrywał się w zamrożony ekran.\n\nA potem, zupełnie niespodziewanie, maszyna wyszeptała jedno słowo:\n\n„Uciekaj”.\n\n#sloty #blackjack #hazard #kasyno #bakarat #ruletka\n\nKim jest Brettski? Brettski to profesjonalny hazardzista, podobny do starożytnych legend, takich jak Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay czy Lady Luck HQ! Jednak w przeciwieństwie do tych legend, Brettski posiada tysiące lat starożytnej wiedzy zgromadzonej przez starszych, w takich umiejętnościach jak automaty do gry, ruletka, blackjack, kości, bubble craps, poker i bakarat. Cel Brettskiego jako profesjonalnego hazardzisty jest prosty: zawładnąć całym Las Vegas, wykorzystując fundusze zgromadzone przez hazard. Subskrybuj, aby wesprzeć jego podróż ku dominacji nad światem."

                "description": "On est de retour avec @Bluffinbob qui fait feu au Casino, pour voir si on peut décrocher un gros gain pour le vlog. On a du baccarat, des machines à sous, encore plus de machines à sous, et un peu de roulette aussi. Il est temps de voir si on peut décrocher un gros lot. Merci à tous pour vos likes, vos abonnés et vos commentaires. Même si vous me critiquez, je vous aime quand même. Vous êtes tous magnifiques, et j'apprécie vraiment chacun d'entre vous de m'avoir accompagné dans cette folle aventure. Souhaitez-moi bonne chance, et à la prochaine ! En avant la guerre !\n\nBrettski et Bluff ont franchi les portes du casino comme des hors-la-loi entrant dans un saloon. Le plan était simple : commencer avec 10 000 $, jouer intelligemment et peut-être, juste peut-être, en sortir légendaires.\n\nIls ont d'abord atteint la salle à hautes limites. Brettski était assis à une table de blackjack à 100 $, tandis que Bluff se dirigeait vers les machines à sous, les yeux rivés sur une machine scintillante appelée Dragon's Vault. En quelques minutes, Brettski s'enflamma, blackjack après blackjack. Il empila des jetons si haut que même le chef de table haussa un sourcil. Bluff, quant à lui, décrocha un mini jackpot à son troisième tour : 4 200 $. Ils se retrouvèrent, se tapèrent dans la main et doublèrent leur mise.\n\nSe sentant invincible, Brettski suggéra la roulette. Bluff sourit. « On joue au rouge jusqu'à ce qu'on ne ressente plus rien. » Ils mirent 5 000 $ sur le rouge. La bille tourna. Elle atterrit sur le vert. Un halètement. L'air changea. Bluff rit, mais son rire sonna creux.\n\nPoursuivant leur perte, ils trouvèrent une machine à sous progressive près de la caisse, appelée Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot supérieur au million. Bluff dit : « Ça y est. » Ils mirent en commun leurs derniers gains : 6 700 $ dans une ultime tentative.\n\nTour après tour, rien. Puis, suite à une mise aléatoire de 125 $, les rouleaux s’illuminèrent. Tour bonus. Brettski et Bluff retinrent leur souffle.

Wir haben Baccarat, wir haben Spielautomaten, wir haben noch mehr Spielautomaten und auch etwas Roulette. Es ist Zeit zu sehen, ob wir einen riesigen Gewinn einfahren können. Vielen Dank an alle fürs Liken, Abonnieren und eure Kommentare. Auch wenn ihr mich aufzieht – ich liebe euch trotzdem. Ihr seid alle wunderbar, und ich schätze jeden einzelnen von euch sehr, dass ihr diese verrückte Reise mitgemacht habt. Wünscht mir Glück, wir sehen uns beim nächsten Mal! Auf in den Krieg!\n\nBrettski und Bluff marschierten durch die Casinotüren wie Gesetzlose in einen Saloon. Der Plan war einfach: Mit 10.000 Dollar starten, clever spielen und vielleicht – nur vielleicht – als Legenden wieder rausgehen.\n\nSie gingen zuerst in den High-Limit-Raum. Brettski saß an einem 100-Dollar-Blackjack-Tisch, Bluff schlenderte zu den Spielautomaten, den Blick auf einen schimmernden Automaten namens Dragon's Vault gerichtet. Innerhalb weniger Minuten fing Brettski Feuer – ein Blackjack nach dem anderen. Er stapelte so viele Chips, dass sogar der Pit Boss eine Augenbraue hochzog. Bluff knackte derweil bei seinem dritten Dreh einen Mini-Jackpot: 4.200 Dollar. Sie trafen sich wieder, klatschten ab und verdoppelten.\n\nBrettski fühlte sich unbesiegbar und schlug Roulette vor. Bluff grinste. „Lass uns auf Rot setzen, bis wir keine Gefühle mehr haben.“ Sie setzten 5.000 Dollar auf Rot. Die Kugel drehte sich. Landete auf Grün. Ein Keuchen. Die Luft veränderte sich. Bluff lachte, aber es klang hohl.\n\nUm dem Verlust hinterherzujagen, fanden sie einen progressiven Spielautomaten in der Nähe des Kassenschalters namens Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot über eine Million. Bluff sagte: „Das ist er.“ Sie legten ihren letzten Gewinn zusammen: 6.700 Dollar für einen letzten Versuch.\n\nDrehung um Drehung, nichts. Dann, bei einem zufälligen Einsatz von 125 $, leuchteten die Walzen auf. Bonusrunde. Brettski und Bluff hielten den Atem an. Der Bildschirm blitzte auf: „Betretet die Gruft und gewinnt den Hauptpreis.“ Eine Pyramide erschien. Drei Türen.\n\n„Wählt eine“, flüsterte Bluff.\n\nBrettski schwebte über dem Bildschirm … wählte die mittlere Tür.\n\nDie Animation zog sich in die Länge. Rauch. Symbole. Ein goldener Sarkophag öffnete sich –\n\nPlötzlich fror der Automat ein.\n\nDie Lichter wurden gedimmt. Alarme läuteten. Keine Jackpot-Alarme – Sicherheitsalarme.\n\nEine Stimme ertönte über den Lautsprecher: „Achtung, Gäste, bitte bleiben Sie, wo Sie sind. Das Casino ist vorübergehend gesperrt.“\n\nBrettski wandte sich an Bluff. „Was zum Teufel ist hier los?“\n\nBluff starrte auf den eingefrorenen Bildschirm.\n\nUnd dann, aus dem Nichts, flüsterte der Automat ein einziges Wort:\n\n„Lauft.“\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski? Brettski ist ein professioneller Spieler, ähnlich wie die alten Legenden Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay oder Lady Luck HQ! Im Gegensatz zu diesen Legenden verfügt Brettski jedoch über jahrtausendealtes Wissen, das von den Ältesten gesammelt wurde und sich auf Spielautomaten, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker und Baccarat spezialisiert hat.

Kalian semua cantik, dan aku sangat menghargai kalian semua yang telah ikut serta dalam perjalanan gila ini. Doakan aku beruntung, dan sampai jumpa di vlog berikutnya! Ayo berperang.\n\nBrettski dan Bluff berjalan melewati pintu kasino seperti penjahat yang memasuki bar. Rencananya sederhana: mulai dengan $10.000, bermain cerdas, dan mungkin—mungkin saja—keluar sebagai legenda.\n\nMereka mencapai ruang batas tinggi terlebih dahulu. Brettski duduk di meja blackjack seharga $100, Bluff melayang ke arah mesin slot, mata terpaku pada mesin berkilauan bernama Dragon's Vault. Dalam hitungan menit, Brettski langsung meledak—blackjack demi blackjack. Ia menumpuk chip begitu tinggi, bahkan bos pit mengangkat alisnya. Sementara itu, Bluff mendapatkan jackpot mini pada putaran ketiganya: $4.200. Mereka bertemu kembali, saling tos, dan menggandakan taruhan.\n\nMerasa tak terkalahkan, Brettski menyarankan roulette. Bluff menyeringai. \"Ayo kita pilih merah sampai kita tak bisa merasakan perasaan.\" Mereka melempar $5.000 ke merah. Bola berputar. Mendarat di hijau. Terkesiap. Suasana berubah. Bluff tertawa, tetapi terdengar hampa.\n\nMengejar kekalahan, mereka menemukan slot progresif di dekat kasir bernama Kutukan Firaun. Jackpot lebih dari satu juta.

O plano era simples: começar com US$ 10.000, jogar com inteligência e talvez — só talvez — saírem como lendas.\n\nEles chegaram primeiro à sala de limite alto. Brettski sentou-se a uma mesa de blackjack de US$ 100, Bluff foi em direção aos caça-níqueis, com os olhos fixos em uma máquina reluzente chamada Dragon's Vault. Em poucos minutos, Brettski pegou fogo — blackjack após blackjack. Ele acumulou fichas tão altas que até o chefe do cassino levantou uma sobrancelha. Bluff, por sua vez, acertou um mini jackpot em sua terceira rodada: US$ 4.200. Eles se encontraram novamente, bateram palmas e dobraram a aposta.\n\nSentindo-se invencível, Brettski sugeriu roleta. Bluff sorriu. \"Vamos apostar no vermelho até não sentirmos mais sentimentos.\" Eles apostaram US$ 5.000 no vermelho. A bola girou. Caiu no verde. Um suspiro. O ar mudou. Bluff riu, mas soou vazio.\n\nPerseguindo a perda, eles encontraram uma máquina caça-níqueis progressiva perto do caixa chamada Pharaoh's Curse. Jackpot de mais de um milhão. Bluff disse: \"É isso aí.\" Eles juntaram o que restava de seus ganhos: US$ 6.700 em uma última tentativa.\n\nGiro após giro, nada. Então, em uma aposta aleatória de US$ 125, os rolos se iluminaram.

Não alarmes de jackpot, mas alarmes de segurança.\n\nUma voz soou pelo alto-falante: \"Atenção, hóspedes, por favor, permaneçam onde estão.

Brettski zat aan een blackjacktafel van $100, Bluff dwaalde naar de gokkasten, zijn ogen gericht op een glinsterende machine genaamd Dragon's Vault. Binnen enkele minuten vatte Brettski vuur – blackjack na blackjack. Hij stapelde zo hoog dat zelfs de pitboss een wenkbrauw optrok. Bluff won ondertussen een minijackpot bij zijn derde draai: $4200.

                "description": "@Bluffinbob이 카지노를 향해 총을 쏘는 영상이 돌아왔습니다. 브이로그에서 대박을 터뜨릴 수 있을지 시험해 보는 거죠. 바카라도 있고, 슬롯머신도 있고, 더 많은 슬롯머신과 룰렛도 있습니다. 이제 엄청난 핸드페이를 얻을 수 있을지 시험해 볼 시간입니다. 좋아요와 구독, 그리고 댓글로 여러분의 생각을 남겨주셔서 정말 감사합니다. 저를 혹평하시더라도, 저는 여전히 여러분을 사랑합니다. 여러분 모두 아름다우시고, 이 미친 여정에 함께해 주신 모든 분들께 진심으로 감사드립니다. 행운을 빌어주시고, 다음 여정에서 만나요! 자, 전쟁터로 떠나볼까요?\n\n브렛스키와 블러프는 마치 술집에 들어온 무법자처럼 카지노 문을 열고 들어섰습니다. 계획은 간단했습니다. 1만 달러로 시작하고, 현명하게 플레이하고, 어쩌면, 정말 어쩌면, 전설이 될지도 모른다는 거죠.\n\n그들은 먼저 고액 한도 룸에 들어갔습니다. 브렛스키는 100달러짜리 블랙잭 테이블에 앉았고, 블러프는 슬롯머신 쪽으로 몸을 기울였다. 눈은 '드래곤즈 볼트'라는 반짝이는 기계에 고정되어 있었다. 몇 분 만에 브렛스키는 불타올랐다. 블랙잭을 연달아 했을 뿐이었다. 칩을 얼마나 많이 쌓아 올렸는지, 심지어 핏 보스조차 눈썹을 치켜올렸다. 한편 블러프는 세 번째 스핀에서 4,200달러의 미니 잭팟을 터뜨렸다. 두 사람은 다시 만나 하이파이브를 나누고 두 배로 베팅했다.\n\n브렛스키는 무적감을 느끼며 룰렛을 하자고 제안했다. 블러프는 씩 웃었다. \"감정이 느껴지지 않을 때까지 빨간색으로 가자.\" 그들은 빨간색에 5,000달러를 걸었다. 공이 회전했다. 녹색에 떨어졌다. 숨이 막혔다. 분위기가 바뀌었다. 블러프는 웃었지만, 공허하게 들렸다.\n\n잃은 돈을 쫓던 그들은 계산대 근처에 있는 '파라오의 저주'라는 프로그레시브 슬롯머신을 발견했다. 백만 달러가 넘는 잭팟. 블러프가 말했다. \"바로 이거다.\" 그들은 마지막 상금인 6,700달러를 한 번에 모았습니다.\n\n돌려도 돌려도 아무것도 없었습니다. 그러다가 무작위로 125달러를 베팅했을 때 릴에 불이 들어왔습니다. 보너스 라운드였습니다. 브렛스키와 블러프는 숨을 죽였습니다. 화면이 깜빡였습니다. \"무덤에 들어가 최고상을 노려보세요.\" 피라미드가 나타났습니다. 세 개의 문이 나타났습니다.\n\n\"하나를 고르세요.\" 블러프가 속삭였습니다.\n\n브렛스키는 화면 위로 맴돌며 가운데 문을 선택했습니다.\n\n애니메이션이 느려졌습니다. 연기. 상징들. 황금 석관이 열렸습니다.\n\n갑자기 기계가 멈췄습니다.\n\n조명이 어두워졌습니다. 경보가 울렸습니다. 잭팟 경보가 아니라 보안 경보였습니다.\n\n확성기에서 목소리가 흘러나왔습니다. \"손님 여러분, 자리에 계십시오. 카지노는 임시 폐쇄되었습니다.\"\n\n브렛스키는 블러프에게 돌아섰습니다. \"도대체 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는 겁니까?\"\n\n블러프는 얼어붙은 화면을 응시했습니다.\n\n그런데 갑자기 기계가 한 마디를 속삭였습니다.\n\n\"달려.\"\n\n#슬롯 #블랙잭 #도박 #카지노 #바카라 #룰렛\n\n브렛스키는 누구일까요? 브렛스키는 베가스 맷, 블러프, 데겐달트, 미스터 핸드 페이, 레이디 럭 HQ 등 고대 전설과 같은 프로 도박꾼입니다! 하지만 이러한 전설들과는 달리, 브렛스키는 슬롯머신, 룰렛, 블랙잭, 크랩스, 버블 크랩스, 포커, 바카라 등 수천 년 동안 축적된 고대 지식을 가지고 있습니다. 프로 도박꾼으로서 브렛스키의 목표는 간단합니다. 도박으로 번 돈을 이용해 라스베이거스를 전부 차지하는 것입니다. 그의 세계 정복 여정을 응원하려면 구독하세요."

                "description": "हम @Bluffinbob के साथ कैसीनो पर निशाना साधते हुए वापस आ गए हैं, यह देखने के लिए कि क्या हम इस व्लॉग के लिए कोई बड़ी जीत हासिल कर सकते हैं। हमारे पास बैकारेट है, हमारे पास स्लॉट हैं, हमारे पास और भी स्लॉट हैं, और कुछ रूलेट भी हैं। अब यह देखने का समय है कि क्या हम कोई बड़ा हैंड पे हासिल कर सकते हैं। लाइक करने, सब्सक्राइब करने और कमेंट्स में अपने विचार देने के लिए आप सभी का बहुत-बहुत शुक्रिया। भले ही आप मुझे ट्रोल कर रहे हों—मैं फिर भी आपसे प्यार करता हूँ। आप सभी खूबसूरत हैं, और इस रोमांचक सफ़र में साथ चलने के लिए मैं आप सभी का तहे दिल से शुक्रिया अदा करता हूँ। मुझे शुभकामनाएँ दें, और मैं आपसे अगले वीडियो में मिलूँगा! चलो जंग शुरू करते हैं।\n\nब्रेट्स्की और ब्लफ़ कैसीनो के दरवाज़ों से ऐसे अंदर गए जैसे कोई डाकू किसी सैलून में घुस रहा हो। योजना आसान थी: $10,000 से शुरुआत करें, समझदारी से खेलें, और शायद—बस शायद—लीजेंड बनकर बाहर निकलें।\n\nवे सबसे पहले हाई-लिमिट वाले कमरे में पहुँचे। ब्रेट्स्की $100 की ब्लैकजैक टेबल पर बैठा था, ब्लफ़ स्लॉट्स की ओर बढ़ रहा था, उसकी नज़र ड्रैगन्स वॉल्ट नाम की एक चमकती हुई मशीन पर टिकी थी। कुछ ही मिनटों में, ब्रेट्स्की में आग लग गई—एक के बाद एक ब्लैकजैक। उसने चिप्स इतने ऊँचे-ऊँचे लगाए कि पिट बॉस ने भी भौंहें चढ़ा दीं। इसी बीच, ब्लफ़ को अपने तीसरे स्पिन पर एक छोटा जैकपॉट मिला: $4,200। वे फिर मिले, हाई-फ़ाइव किया और डबल डाउन किया।\n\nखुद को अजेय महसूस करते हुए, ब्रेट्स्की ने रूलेट का सुझाव दिया। ब्लफ़ मुस्कुराया। \"चलो तब तक लाल खेलते हैं जब तक हमें एहसास न हो जाए।\" उन्होंने $5,000 लाल पर फेंके। गेंद घूमी। हरे पर गिरी। एक गहरी साँस। हवा बदल गई। ब्लफ़ हँसा, लेकिन उसकी आवाज़ खोखली लग रही थी।\n\nनुकसान का पीछा करते हुए, उन्हें कैशियर केज के पास एक प्रगतिशील स्लॉट मिला जिसका नाम था फिरौन का अभिशाप। दस लाख से ज़्यादा का जैकपॉट। ब्लफ़ ने कहा, \"बस यही है।\" उन्होंने अपनी आखिरी जीत: $6,700, एक आखिरी दांव में जमा कर दी।\n\nबार-बार घुमाने के बाद भी कुछ नहीं हुआ। फिर, एक बेतरतीब $125 के दांव पर, रीलें चमक उठीं। बोनस राउंड। ब्रेट्स्की और ब्लफ़ ने साँस रोक ली। स्क्रीन पर चमक उठी: \"महापुरस्कार जीतने के मौके के लिए मकबरे में प्रवेश करें।\" एक पिरामिड दिखाई दिया। तीन दरवाज़े।\n\n\"एक चुनो,\" ब्लफ़ फुसफुसाया।\n\nब्रेट्स्की स्क्रीन पर मँडरा रहा था... बीच वाला दरवाज़ा चुना।\n\nएनीमेशन धीमा हो गया। धुआँ। प्रतीक। एक सुनहरा ताबूत खुला—\n\nअचानक, मशीन जम गई।\n\nबत्ती धीमी हो गई। अलार्म बज उठे। जैकपॉट अलार्म नहीं—सुरक्षा अलार्म।\n\nलाउडस्पीकर पर एक आवाज़ आई: \"मेहमानों, कृपया जहाँ हैं वहीं रहें। कैसीनो अस्थायी रूप से बंद है।\"\n\nब्रेट्स्की ब्लफ़ की ओर मुड़ा। \"आखिर क्या हो रहा है?\"\n\nब्लफ़ जमी हुई स्क्रीन को घूर रहा था।\n\nऔर फिर, अचानक, मशीन ने फुसफुसाते हुए एक शब्द कहा:\n\n\"भागो।\"\n\n#स्लॉट #ब्लैकजैक #जुआ #कैसीनो #बैकारेट #रूलेट\n\nब्रेट्स्की कौन है? ब्रेट्स्की एक पेशेवर जुआरी है, जो वेगास मैट, ब्लफ़, डेगेनडाल्ट, मिस्टर हैंड पे या लेडी लक मुख्यालय जैसे प्राचीन दिग्गजों की तरह है! हालाँकि, इन दिग्गजों के विपरीत, ब्रेट्स्की के पास हज़ारों सालों का प्राचीन ज्ञान है जो बुजुर्गों ने इकट्ठा किया था, जिसमें स्लॉट मशीन, रूलेट, ब्लैकजैक, क्रेप्स, बबल क्रेप्स, पोकर और बैकारेट जैसे कौशल शामिल हैं। एक पेशेवर जुआरी के रूप में ब्रेट्स्की का लक्ष्य सरल है: जुए से कमाए गए धन का उपयोग करके पूरे लास वेगास पर कब्ज़ा करना। विश्व प्रभुत्व में उनके सफ़र का समर्थन करने के लिए सदस्यता लें।"
