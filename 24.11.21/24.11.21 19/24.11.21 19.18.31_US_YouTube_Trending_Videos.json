            "description": "Get ready to craft your world. #MinecraftMovie - only in theaters 2025. \n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. \n\nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge. \n\nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, blocky wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. \n\nOscar nominee Hess (“Ninety-Five Senses,” “Nacho Libre”) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing. \n\nThe director’s creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (“127 Hours,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “The Meg”), editor James Thomas (“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu”, the “Borat” films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (“The Jungle Book,” “The Batman”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“The Meg,” “What We Do in the Shadows”). Casting is by Rachel Tenner. The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (“Thor: Ragnarok,” the “LEGO®” movies). \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Mojäng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, “A Minecraft Movie.” The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025.",

                "description": "Get ready to craft your world. #MinecraftMovie - only in theaters 2025. \n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. \n\nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge. \n\nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, blocky wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. \n\nOscar nominee Hess (“Ninety-Five Senses,” “Nacho Libre”) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing. \n\nThe director’s creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (“127 Hours,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “The Meg”), editor James Thomas (“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu”, the “Borat” films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (“The Jungle Book,” “The Batman”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“The Meg,” “What We Do in the Shadows”). Casting is by Rachel Tenner. The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (“Thor: Ragnarok,” the “LEGO®” movies). \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Mojäng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, “A Minecraft Movie.” The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025."

            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \n#HowToTrainYourDragon",

            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon",

            "description": "Save up to 50% sitewide for Piloti’s Black Friday Sale from November 21st – December 2nd  https://bit.ly/3OdZRHX\n\nThe 2025 BMW M5 ($135,000 starting in Canada, $119,500 starting in the US) is all new this year and has a lot to prove. Today’s drag race will see it pitted against the ferocious Audi RS7 ($145,150 starting in Canada, $128,600 starting in the US) and the mighty Mercedes-AMG E63 S ($139,000 starting in Canada, $112,800 starting in the US). The new M5 is the horsepower and torque leader of the bunch, but it is also the heaviest by quite a margin. Will its new hybrid tech help propel it to victory? Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race - especially when there is a surprise contender added to the mix! We hope you enjoy the episode. Subscribe!\n\nHuge thanks to Alpha Auto Sales for lending us their E63.

                "description": "Save up to 50% sitewide for Piloti’s Black Friday Sale from November 21st – December 2nd  https://bit.ly/3OdZRHX\n\nThe 2025 BMW M5 ($135,000 starting in Canada, $119,500 starting in the US) is all new this year and has a lot to prove. Today’s drag race will see it pitted against the ferocious Audi RS7 ($145,150 starting in Canada, $128,600 starting in the US) and the mighty Mercedes-AMG E63 S ($139,000 starting in Canada, $112,800 starting in the US). The new M5 is the horsepower and torque leader of the bunch, but it is also the heaviest by quite a margin. Will its new hybrid tech help propel it to victory? Things don’t always go as you might expect in a drag race - especially when there is a surprise contender added to the mix! We hope you enjoy the episode. Subscribe!\n\nHuge thanks to Alpha Auto Sales for lending us their E63.

Try Rocket Money for free: https://RocketMoney.com/hankgreen  #rocketmoney #personalfinance Sponsored by Rocket Money\n\nSince I filmed this video, a number of THINGS have happened, including the re-election of Donald Trump. One thing about Donald Trump you never really know what he means by anything he says, but my overall analysis is that this probably slows this down because one thing that is bad for very large-scale projects is a LACK OF LONG TERM CLARITY, and having a couple of knuckleheads threatening to eliminate a third of the government isn't great for long-term clarity.\n\nI don't think it changes the politics or the science, but regulations and approvals are the biggest concern here, and unless someone is actually focused on that, it's going to get kicked down the road. \n\nBut things do continue to move...here's a bunch of nuclear energy news just from the last week:\n\nUS to triple nuclear capacity by 2050: https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/us-sets-targets-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050\n\nRolls Royce to provide small reactors for data centers and space missions: https://www.yahoo.com/tech/rolls-royce-talks-compact-nuclear-151713919.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN7BTAE1sZxcD4uyjOFTrBs1fQY_j3MIM3oE7m6AVRxMyzOJ2MVGS0tfevew39Z3HmM_fR0HCMjhLAPt4VbSVidHeFjhg-W9UbO97PmWZyGA05gC50W5CbuWaVTjhetFgmES5-YIHg8QqRwH6BrabW85nO5h8QcdHyxqWrX_Wodl\n\nThree Mile Island Restart Could Mark a Turning Point: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/16/three-mile-island-nuclear-turning-point-as-big-tech-influence-grows.html\n\nOnce Shunned in Climate Talks, Nuclear is now a Rising Star: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/climate/cop29-climate-nuclear-power.html",

Try Rocket Money for free: https://RocketMoney.com/hankgreen  #rocketmoney #personalfinance Sponsored by Rocket Money\n\nSince I filmed this video, a number of THINGS have happened, including the re-election of Donald Trump. One thing about Donald Trump you never really know what he means by anything he says, but my overall analysis is that this probably slows this down because one thing that is bad for very large-scale projects is a LACK OF LONG TERM CLARITY, and having a couple of knuckleheads threatening to eliminate a third of the government isn't great for long-term clarity.\n\nI don't think it changes the politics or the science, but regulations and approvals are the biggest concern here, and unless someone is actually focused on that, it's going to get kicked down the road. \n\nBut things do continue to move...here's a bunch of nuclear energy news just from the last week:\n\nUS to triple nuclear capacity by 2050: https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/us-sets-targets-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050\n\nRolls Royce to provide small reactors for data centers and space missions: https://www.yahoo.com/tech/rolls-royce-talks-compact-nuclear-151713919.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN7BTAE1sZxcD4uyjOFTrBs1fQY_j3MIM3oE7m6AVRxMyzOJ2MVGS0tfevew39Z3HmM_fR0HCMjhLAPt4VbSVidHeFjhg-W9UbO97PmWZyGA05gC50W5CbuWaVTjhetFgmES5-YIHg8QqRwH6BrabW85nO5h8QcdHyxqWrX_Wodl\n\nThree Mile Island Restart Could Mark a Turning Point: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/16/three-mile-island-nuclear-turning-point-as-big-tech-influence-grows.html\n\nOnce Shunned in Climate Talks, Nuclear is now a Rising Star: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/climate/cop29-climate-nuclear-power.html"

A MINECRAFT MOVIE coming April 4, 2025. Only in theaters.\n \nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. \n \nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge. \n \nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, blocky wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. \n \nOscar nominee Hess (“Ninety-Five Senses,” “Nacho Libre”) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing. \n \nThe director’s creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (“127 Hours,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “The Meg”), editor James Thomas (“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu”, the “Borat” films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (“The Jungle Book,” “The Batman”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“The Meg,” “What We Do in the Shadows”). Casting is by Rachel Tenner. The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (“Thor: Ragnarok,” the “LEGO®” movies). \n \nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Mojäng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, “A Minecraft Movie.” The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025. \n \nCredits not final, subject to change",

As a massive Cobra Kai fan, this project is a tribute to the many ways that the show has impacted my own life, as well as many others. I hope you enjoy the trailer, and get excited for the video- dropping this Friday 11/22 on YouTube! This is the most fun I’ve ever had making a video. Let me know what you think of the trailer! \n\nThis video is not monetized and is ad-free. We are unaffiliated with Cobra Kai or Netflix."

Liftoff from pad 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base is scheduled for Sunday, November 17, at 9:53 p.m. PDT (12:53 a.m. EDT, 0553 UTC). The first-stage booster, making its 20th flight, will land on the drone ship 'Of Course I Still Love You' about eight and a half minutes into the flight.\n\nThe Starlink 9-9 mission includes 13 satellites capable of providing direct to cellphone services. Once it leaves the pad, the Falcon 9 rocket will fly in a southeasterly trajectory.\n\nOur live coverage with commentary from Will Robinson-Smith will begin about 30 minutes before launch.\n\nVideos like this are made possible by the support of our members.

The first-stage booster, making its 20th flight, will land on the drone ship 'Of Course I Still Love You' about eight and a half minutes into the flight.\n\nThe Starlink 9-9 mission includes 13 satellites capable of providing direct to cellphone services. Once it leaves the pad, the Falcon 9 rocket will fly in a southeasterly trajectory.\n\nOur live coverage with commentary from Will Robinson-Smith will begin about 30 minutes before launch.\n\nVideos like this are made possible by the support of our members.

In this spine-chilling video, we delve into Creepy Mario Myths That Will Keep You Up at Night—mysteries so eerie they’ll make you think twice about your favorite childhood games. From hidden horrors in iconic levels to rumors of ghostly encounters and unexplained phenomena, these legends blur the line between fact and fiction.\n\nThe haunting story behind the Killer Piano in Big Boo's Haunt—and the chilling sound that comes with it\nThe unsettling mystery of Luigi’s Shadow in Super Mario 64—could it be a ghostly Easter egg or something more sinister?\nDark whispers and distorted music in the “Unfinished Levels” of Mario games \nThe creepy origins of Wario’s face on the cover of Mario 64 DS \nWhy some players believe Bowser’s laugh hides a terrifying secret \nAnd much more that will leave you questioning the innocence of the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\nThese myths aren’t just eerie tales—they’re backed by stories from players who swear they’ve experienced these chilling events firsthand.
