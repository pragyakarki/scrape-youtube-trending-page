I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a secret gaming room!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from my Wife, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from My Family, But Secret Hidden Gaming Room Inside a Couch, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My House *PS5*, But Little Girl Finds A Secret Room In Her House That Leads Into An Even Wilder Surprise, But I Built a Secret Room in Public, But I Turned an Old Dumpster into an Epic Secret Room, But INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS Hidden Rooms and Secret Furniture , But I Built a Secret Room, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My New House, But Hidden Entrance INSIDE Stairs To DREAM Gaming Room, But I Found The ULTIMATE HIDDEN GAMING ROOM In My New House or any other video like JStu, FrenchieFries, Jake Carlini, Ben Azelart, AllWeDoIsFun, Zealous, Tiana Wilson, Dangie Bros, Drew Dirksen, Carter Sharer, MARKO, Interesting & Creative Designs, Chris & Emily, Unspeakable, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) builds a secret hidden gaming room inside the stairs to hide from his mom!"

            "description": "Nicholaus Joseph Williams, better known by his stage name Trinidad James is a Trinidadian-American rapper. In 2012, he signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. The label dropped him in 2014 when he failed to release an album, although he continues to release music as an independent artist and is signed to Artist Publishing Group for songwriting.  \n\nIn this interview Marco starts off by asking who does Trinidad want to be? The interview starts very awkwardly as Trinidad has a bear mask on. Trinidad challenges Marco and says Marco brought him on the show to exploit him. The tables are turned as Trinidad seems to be trolling Marco and has him on his toes. Marco asks Trinidad to remove his mask and Trinidad asks Marco to tie his tie and in exchange Trinidad takes the tie and puts it on. Trinidad takes off his mask to reveal his face with one eyed made up. Marco gets into the interview asking why Trinidad hasn’t made any new music. Trinidad reveals that he wanted to know what the business of entertainment was about. Trinidad talks about his relationships with record labels. Trinidad goes deeper into relationships. Trinidad then goes into his various products and the meaning behind them. Trinidad asks Marco what he thinks about him. Trinidad and Marco go back and forth about the word ugly. The conversation speeds up and the two go back and forth. Marco’s phone goes off and Marco blames it on Matt the Producer. Matt the Producer enters and Trinidad and Matt get into a discussion that gets a little tense. Trinidad and Marco continue the interview. Marco asks Trinidad about his hair. Matt the Producer tells Trinidad to get out of Marco’s creative space. A lady enters from the backstage and Trinidad yells at the lady and Marco invites her on stage. She awkwardly exits and Marco attempts to end the interview as Marco exits while talking to Matt the Producer and the mics are hot. Trinidad throws his chair and goes under the ladder and Matt the Producer holds exception.\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n \nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @mattablespromotions\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n \nIG @Breakbeatmedia @FunnyMarco\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube page, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com",

            "description": "A majestic creature to help you achieve a most noble victory, the Falcon Scout item is at your service! Deploy your Falcon Scout and control where it flies, ping or place markers, and caw to create a radius in which all opponents will be marked for your squad. You can also use your Falcon Scout to open containers and pick up loot. Carry the loot to yourself or a teammate and then scout for more!\n\nTo help you easily control your Falcon Scout, your view will shift to behind it. This may leave you defenseless if you’re not fighting in a team, so be sure to find a hiding spot if you’re battling solo. Also, be careful where you’re flying, as the Falcon Scout is vulnerable to enemy attack. (See its remaining Health in its Health bar.) Because the Falcon Scout is controlled remotely, there’s a max distance it can fly from you, trackable in its distance bar.\n\nFalcon Scouts are findable from the ground, regular Chests, Oathbound Chests, and Supply Drops. There’s no limit as to how many times you can use the same Falcon Scout in a match.\n\nPlay Fortnite Battle Royale, the completely free 100-player PvP mode. One giant map, A Battle Bus, Last one standing wins.

                "description": "Exploring Why This 17-Year Old's Electric Motor Is Important. Get Surfshark VPN at https://surfshark.deals/undecided - Enter promo code UNDECIDED for 83% off and 3 extra months for FREE!  Permanent magnets are a critical resource for renewables, because the generators in some wind turbines and motors in electric vehicles rely on them to run. A Floridian high school student has just shown us how to make a better electric motor without rare earth magnets. Another company is using cloud computing to try to improve electric motor performance — also without rare earths. There’s some exciting advances being made when it comes to electric motors, but how much of a difference can they make?\n\nCORRECTIONS: \n09:40: Text should read 750 RPM. \nI've trimmed a couple of short sections from the video that were creating confusion.  I didn't mean to imply that AC motors use magnets, but the wording during some moments made it sound like I was.  Magnetless motors are not a new thing, but optimizing their design for high efficiency, high torque, without rare earths opens the door for more use cases.\n\nWatch How Can A Wind Turbine Be Motionless? https://youtu.be/OkRqVBpO2BQ?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7UWp64ZlOKUPNXePMTdU4d\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/why-this-17-year-olds-electric-motor-is-important/\n\nFollow-up podcast:\nVideo version - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-aWB84Bupf5hxGqrwYqLA\nAudio version - http://bit.ly/stilltbdfm\n\nJoin the Undecided Discord server:\nhttps://geni.us/undecided-discord\n\n👋 Support Undecided on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mattferrell\n\n\n⚙️ Gear & Products I Like\nTesla and smart home gear:\nhttps://kit.co/undecidedmf\n\nGreat sustainable products for your home:\nhttps://geni.us/buildwithrise\n\nUndecided Amazon store front:\nhttps://geni.us/undecidedAmazon\n\nFun, nerdy t-shirts:\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedShirts\n\nAbstract Ocean Tesla Accessories:\n15% Discount - Code: \"Undecided\"\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedAO\n\nJeda Tesla Wireless Charger/USB Hub:\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedJeda\n\nTesla Referral Code:\nGet 1,000 free supercharging miles \nor a discount on Tesla Solar & Powerwalls\nhttps://ts.la/matthew84515\n\nVisit my Energysage Portal:\nResearch solar panels and get quotes for free!\nhttp://www.energysage.com/p/undecided/\n\nOr find community solar near you:\nhttps://communitysolar.energysage.com/?rc=p-undecided\n\n\n👉 Follow Me\nTwitter \nhttps://twitter.com/mattferrell\nhttps://twitter.com/undecidedMF\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mattferrell\nhttps://www.instagram.com/undecidedmf\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/undecidedMF/\n\nWebsite\nhttps://undecidedmf.com\n\n\n📺 YouTube Tools I Recommend\nAudio file(s) provided by Epidemic Sound\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedEpidemic\n\nTubeBuddy\nhttps://www.tubebuddy.com/undecided\n\nVidIQ\nhttps://vidiq.com/undecided\n\n\nI may earn a small commission for my endorsement or recommendation to products or services linked above, but I wouldn't put them here if I didn't like them.

It was actually pretty fun, despite the fact I had 3 different illneses at the same time while I was there. I was constantly freezing and coughing, but I still managed to have fun. There were some scary moments, and lots of fun moments with my friends.\n\nBeing able to finally do this stuff in real life is awesome. I never would have thought in a million years that George, Sapnap and I would be traveling to Antarctica instead of filming another Minecraft Manhunt (maybe soon?!).

The 54-year-old actor won Best Actor on Sunday night for his performance in \"The Whale\" and he kicked off his speech by sharing a quote about critics that made the audience laugh. Brendan went on to show appreciation for co-stars Hong Chau and Sadie Sink, plus director Darren Aronofsky. At the end of his emotional speech, he gave some advice for anyone struggling with their weight, which his character overcomes.\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AHsub \n» Visit Our Website: http://accessonline.com\n\nGet More Access : \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/accessonline/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/accessonline\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/accessonline\n\nAbout Access Hollywood:\nAccess Hollywood is a nationally syndicated daily entertainment news show.

The first game is my favourite of all time and I've bought the ps3 version, the ps4 remaster and even the ps5 remake that released a couple of months. This is a game I've completed numerous times on grounded mode and the series is something I've been desperate to do a deep dive on.\n\nThroughout this video we're gonna be breaking down the first episode scene by scene and talking about all the easter eggs, hidden details and what they did differently to the game. If you haven't played it then don't worry because we won't be spoiling what happens down the line as I want you to enjoy the twists and turns as much as I did on my first playthrough.\n\nHowever I may need to touch upon certain things due to characters that get name dropped here but I'll only bring them up in a spoiler section at the end of the video which I'll give you a heads up on.\n\ni'm nice like that\n\nNow unlike the game, the series starts off in 1968. Originally we watched as Sarah woke up in her bed and ventured about the house but here they do it differently. Rather than throwing us in at the night of the outbreak we get some backstory that wasn't even filled in in the source material. The game told us very little about the virus beyond it being cause by Cordyseps which had mutated to infect humans. These real life funghi exist in the jungle and the parasite infects insects and anthropods. Beginning in 1968 though we see a tv show in which two scientists do a big theory time about what the biggest threat to humanity is.\n\nThe first one goes off about how we may have a pandemic level event that's caused by a strain of influenza. Both games were made before Covid 19 and the creative team have kinda retroactively added this into the show to comment on it I think. The scientist mentions how airplanes are a new element that will help viruses like this spread easier and later on we see several planes flying overhead as Sarah, Joel and Tommy make their escape.\n\nThey add a lot of focus to them during the car scene and actually change up how the crash happens. Originally it was caused by another car hitting them but they do a fake out in the episode and instead have  plane debris causing it.",

Regardless we would like to share today that Skyblivion is in a state where we can promise a 2025 release at the latest.\nWe hope with your support to finish the final steps in completing our dream, maybe even beating our own estimation. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you feel you can help contribute to this project we would love to have you on the team, please visit our website to apply: https://www.skyblivion.com/volunteer/ \nIf you are a fan of the project and you want to help any other way please share our video where you can, you might just reach someone that will help us finish this monster of a project sooner.\n\nContent creators and journalists can visit this link for screenshots, logo’s and general information about the project: https://skyblivion.com/press-kit/\n\nThank you for all the love and support ~Your Skyblivion Team\n\nWebsite:      https://skyblivion.com/ \nTwitter:        https://twitter.com/TESRSkyblivion \nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/tesrskyblivion \nDISCORD:    https://discord.com/invite/skyblivion\nReddit:         https://www.reddit.com/r/skyblivion/ \nFacebook:   https://www.facebook.com/Skyblivion/ \n\nVOLUNTEER: https://www.skyblivion.com/volunteer/ \n\nFor behind the scenes development streams check out our Twitch team: https://www.twitch.tv/team/theadventurers\n\nVideo production by @HeavyBurns and @SgtGimlinho\n\nVoice Narrating by Daniel Hodge\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/dnhodge \nhttps://twitter.com/danielhodgeva\n\nMusic by Markus Zierhofer & Jeremy Froböse (AudioCreatures)\nhttps://www.audiocreatures.com/"

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Driving a 47' Trimaran Off The Dock\n02:58 Busted Mainsail & Leaving Charleston, SC \n05:27 Open Ocean Sailing NEEL 47\n07:11 Flashback Airport - Surfshark.deals/WYNNS \n08:36 How Well Does a 47' NEEL Trimaran Sail?\n11:06 Sunset, Full Sails & Moonlight\n14:23 Sunrise & Dramatic Weather Swing\n16:35 Genoa, Pour Over Coffee & Breakfast\n19:11 Challenges With the Sails\n23:01 Sailing With Dolphins\n24:59 Beautiful Night Sailing with the Stars\n26:48 Sailing into Saint Augustine FL\n28:56 40 knot Squall, Boat Life: EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED\n33:11 Difference Between Land Life and Boat Life\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #Sailboats #sailing  \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2023",

I’ll share with you exactly what it’s like to fly in Emirates First Class on their A380 including the Shower Spa, inflight lounge & fine dining available. There’s even a new movie menu… which means popcorn in bed!\n\nThis Emirates A380 flight only resumed service a few weeks ago after a pause of service for the last few years. It regains top spot for the world's longest First Class flight and indeed the longest Airbus A380 flight, really pushing the range of the largest commercially available aircraft. There are longer flights, such as the Singapore Airbus A360 ULR to JFK but this only features Business Class. \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:26 - First Class lounge\n7:00 - Seat Tour\n10:55 - Shower Spa\n13:58 - Onboard Lounge\n15:54 - New Zealand",

            "title": "Roblox Combat Warriors: The Chainsaw RoMan",
            "description": "Roblox Combat Warriors is a fighting game where players use a variety of weapons to defeat their opponents.\n\nThis game is a free-for-all arena. After defeating another player, the victor and everyone who assisted in the kill get money that they can use to purchase abilities and better weapons.\n\nTo get money fast, you’ll need to be good at the game and learn the mechanics.\nParrying is essential in defeating the opponent. If a parry is successful, your opponent will be stunned for a few seconds which will result in a guaranteed frag. Other technics, such as sliding and super jump, will improve your odds of catching up and evading others, thus improving your KDA. For more advanced tips and tricks, please watch other tutorials since this video is a funny montage with edits.\n\nI had a pay 2 win moment and just bought the chainsaw and the dragon slayer. So I will have the max level weapons in the gameplay. This video is pre-update, so all the contents such as the new black hole disaster, Yoru heavy weapon and weapons skills that came after the update won't be in it because the video would have been too long.\n\nAfter playing alone for a while, I called in the boys to play together and ganked some people for fun. We chose to use fists because of its funny execution animation. After we got bored, we decided to raid the game with a Roman army for fun. \n\nWe managed to rally 30 people for the invasion all dressed up as Romans legionnaires. However, we would be constantly nuked and or hit with a missile shower. So after a while, we just decided to do a colosseum fight and a drafted versus Romans battle in a private server. \n\nI hope you enjoyed watching me and my friends play/raid this game. There were some codes for this game but I just P2W so I don't know about them. There were a lot of hackers using scripts but I cut those parts out. The disasters and other try hard sweats were a pain to deal with.\n\nBut still, it was still really fun game, I enjoyed it.\n\nLike always, this Roblox Combat Warriors video is filled with a crap ton of unfunny jokes and dead memes in the form of a montage/funny moments. I hope you enjoyed watching us fighting noobs and raiding them.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

                "description": "Roblox Combat Warriors is a fighting game where players use a variety of weapons to defeat their opponents.\n\nThis game is a free-for-all arena. After defeating another player, the victor and everyone who assisted in the kill get money that they can use to purchase abilities and better weapons.\n\nTo get money fast, you’ll need to be good at the game and learn the mechanics.\nParrying is essential in defeating the opponent. If a parry is successful, your opponent will be stunned for a few seconds which will result in a guaranteed frag. Other technics, such as sliding and super jump, will improve your odds of catching up and evading others, thus improving your KDA. For more advanced tips and tricks, please watch other tutorials since this video is a funny montage with edits.\n\nI had a pay 2 win moment and just bought the chainsaw and the dragon slayer. So I will have the max level weapons in the gameplay. This video is pre-update, so all the contents such as the new black hole disaster, Yoru heavy weapon and weapons skills that came after the update won't be in it because the video would have been too long.\n\nAfter playing alone for a while, I called in the boys to play together and ganked some people for fun. We chose to use fists because of its funny execution animation. After we got bored, we decided to raid the game with a Roman army for fun. \n\nWe managed to rally 30 people for the invasion all dressed up as Romans legionnaires. However, we would be constantly nuked and or hit with a missile shower. So after a while, we just decided to do a colosseum fight and a drafted versus Romans battle in a private server. \n\nI hope you enjoyed watching me and my friends play/raid this game. There were some codes for this game but I just P2W so I don't know about them. There were a lot of hackers using scripts but I cut those parts out. The disasters and other try hard sweats were a pain to deal with.\n\nBut still, it was still really fun game, I enjoyed it.\n\nLike always, this Roblox Combat Warriors video is filled with a crap ton of unfunny jokes and dead memes in the form of a montage/funny moments. I hope you enjoyed watching us fighting noobs and raiding them.

CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that.
