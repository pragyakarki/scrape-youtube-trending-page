            "description": "Piers Morgan says he believes the news of King Charles' cancer diagnosis has come as shock to everyone, including the Royal Family.\n\nThe type of cancer has not been disclosed, but it was discovered during the King's recent treatment for an enlarged prostate.\n\nThe King informed close family members, including his sons Prince William and Prince Harry, as well as his three siblings. Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has already spoken to his father over the phone and is said to be flying into the UK in the coming days to see him. The public announcement was made at 6pm, leaving the world in shock and uncertainty.\n\nAlthough the exact details of the diagnosis have not been revealed, it is clear that this is a serious situation. The King began regular treatments as an outpatient, following his recent procedure for an enlarged prostate. He will continue to undertake basic state duties from the Palace, such as his weekly meeting with the Prime Minister. However, all public engagements have been postponed for the duration of his treatment. It remains uncertain whether he will be able to fulfil major international trips planned for the coming months.\n\nPiers Morgan is joined by TalkTV's Royal Editor Sarah Hewson, Royal biographer Tom Bower, broadcaster Andrew Neil, and Roya Nikkah, Royal Editor of The Sunday Times.\n\nSubscribe to stay up-to-date on all Uncensored content.\n\nFollow Piers Morgan Uncensored on:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PiersUncensored\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/piersmorganuncensored/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/piersmorganuncensored\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@piersmorganuncensored\n\nFollow Piers Morgan on:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/piersmorgan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/piersmorgan\n\nPiers Morgan Uncensored is now available on TalkTV, Fox Nation and Sky News Australia!\n\n#kingcharles #piersmorgan #royalfamily #interview #piersmorganuncensored",

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has already spoken to his father over the phone and is said to be flying into the UK in the coming days to see him. The public announcement was made at 6pm, leaving the world in shock and uncertainty.\n\nAlthough the exact details of the diagnosis have not been revealed, it is clear that this is a serious situation. The King began regular treatments as an outpatient, following his recent procedure for an enlarged prostate. He will continue to undertake basic state duties from the Palace, such as his weekly meeting with the Prime Minister. However, all public engagements have been postponed for the duration of his treatment. It remains uncertain whether he will be able to fulfil major international trips planned for the coming months.\n\nPiers Morgan is joined by TalkTV's Royal Editor Sarah Hewson, Royal biographer Tom Bower, broadcaster Andrew Neil, and Roya Nikkah, Royal Editor of The Sunday Times.\n\nSubscribe to stay up-to-date on all Uncensored content.\n\nFollow Piers Morgan Uncensored on:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PiersUncensored\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/piersmorganuncensored/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/piersmorganuncensored\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@piersmorganuncensored\n\nFollow Piers Morgan on:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/piersmorgan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/piersmorgan\n\nPiers Morgan Uncensored is now available on TalkTV, Fox Nation and Sky News Australia!\n\n#kingcharles #piersmorgan #royalfamily #interview #piersmorganuncensored"

            "description": "Strikes in either half from Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, and a late Leandro Trossard goal, gave us a well-deserved win in a high octane Premier League clash at Emirates Stadium.\n\nSaka fired us ahead on 14 minutes, when Kai Havertz’s shot was saved, only for the league leaders to capitalise on a defensive mistake on the stroke of half-time to tie things up with a Gabriel own goal.\n\nA defensive mistake from Liverpool helped us restore the lead miday through the second half, when Martinelli was in the right place to profit from an Alisson Becker air kick.\n\nSubstitute Trossard squeezed in a third in injury-time - after Ibrahima Konate had been red carded - to seal the win in an unforgettable Premier League encounter.\n\nAmid a bubbling atmosphere at kick off, we made an electric start in this, our third meeting with Liverpool in the last seven matches.\n\nIn the opening exchanges Saka screwed a shot wide from a narrow angle after Martin Odegaard won the ball inside the Liverpool box, and moments later the England man came even closer.\n\nDavid Raya claimed a deep Liverpool cross under pressure and immediately released  Martinelli with a long throw over the half-way line. Martinelli raced forward on the left, and whipped in a dangerous cross to the galloping Saka, who threw himself at the diving header, but couldn’t make proper contact. It would have been a magnificent, back to front goal from the Gunners.\n\nTwo strikes for Saka in the opening ten minutes then, but with his third attempt he punished Liverpool. Odegaard picked out a wonderful pass in the middle of the pitch to find  Havertz, bearing down on goal. His shot was parried by Alisson, but the ball fell to Saka, just onside, to control and finish left footed to send the home supporters wild. \n\nThe challenges were snapping in, the passes were fizzing – both teams knew exactly what was at stake at the top of the Premier League table\n\nDeclan Rice and Jorginho were beginning to dominate the midfield battle, and our hard-working and intense press was paying dividends. Odegaard meanwhile was seeing a lot of the ball in dangerous areas as we looked to press home our superiority. The skipper himself had a shot blocked inside the area but as the half wore on the visitors began to make their presence felt.\n\nCody Gakpo came close to getting on the end of a whipped in cross from the right, but we were still on top. Gabriel’s low shot from the edge of the box was easily gathered, and Rice had a shot from the edge of the area charged down at close range.\n\nSo Liverpool’s leveller – deep in first-half injury time, came against the run of play, and was tough to take. William Saliba tried to shield the ball away from Luis Diaz in the box, back to Raya, but the Colombian got a foot in, it bounced off Gabriel’s arm and into our own net. A real mix up.\n\nLiverpool had not had a shot on target in the opening half – including the equaliser – so it completely changed the atmosphere inside the stadium going into the interval. \n\nWe still looked shell shocked as the second period got underway. The visitors had three attempts in as many minutes to start the second period. Diaz, Alexis Mac Allister and Curtis Jones all came close in quick succession as gaps appeared in our defence.\n\nWe needed to show some composure, and a well worked move outside the Liverpool box resulted in our first sight of goal since the interval. Havertz rolled the ball to Odegaard, he shifted it onto his left but his shot was deflected behind for a corner.\n\nHavertz then had a strong penalty appeal turned down, after tangling with Mac Allister in the area, but moments later we were in the lead again.\n\nA long  pass over the top from Gabriel seemed to be covered by Virgil van Dijk and Alisson, but the Liverpool keeper completely missed his attempted clearance, and Martinelli could roll the ball home from the edge of the area.\n\nThe decibel levels lifted again in response. On came Reiss Nelson and Leandro Trossard on the wings, but it was the half-time sub - Jakub Kiwior - who had a great chance to make it 3-1, only to head straight at Alisson when well placed, and in plenty of space inside the box.\n\nWith the tension ramping up, Konate was dismissed for a second bookable offence in the final five minutes.\n\nThe one way to relieve all that pressure was to score a third goal. Trossard duly obliged. The Belgian raced away down the left, then squeezed his shot home through Alisson’s legs at the near post. Cue jubilant celebrations on the touchline, and in the stands.\n\nThe 200th league meeting between these sides turned out to be one of the very best. And it could yet prove to be a crucial result at the season’s end.\n\n#arsenal",

All nominees are based on community suggestions before a final vote is held to decide each category's winner.

This will also be the case for future Awards, but not past ones. Note that a maximum of one badge will be awarded per category. For individual awards, the receiver of the badge is the user in question. In categories for specific works (all level categories and Best Video), it will normally be given to the uploader of the work on the given platform. However, the badge may be transferred to another single member of the work upon request from the uploader. Whether this is accepted or not is at the discretion of RobTop.

However, the badge may be transferred to another single member of the work upon request from the uploader. Whether this is accepted or not is at the discretion of RobTop. We reserve the right to remove any awarded badges due to misconduct in the community at any time.\n\n*CREDITS*\nVideo by @viprin and @zRyder_ \nMontage by @DoggieDasher \nThumbnail by @nasgubb \n\n*MUSIC*\n- \"Link\" by Jim Yosef [NCS Release]: https://youtu.be/9iHM6X6uUH8\n- \"Throwback\" by Electro-Light [NCS Release]: https://youtu.be/cXLadJlS_nA\n- \"Entropy\" by Distrion & Alex Skrindo [NCS Release]: https://youtu.be/iaKgF1Vf5bQ\n- \"Sky and Soul\" by Creo: https://youtu.be/qK51gGqiuL0\n- \"Red Horizon\" by Creo: https://youtu.be/kmYgwc4QYhE\n\n*CHAPTERS*\n00:00 Intro\n00:10 Best Auto Level\n00:48 Best Easy Level\n01:22 Best Normal Level\n02:00 Best Hard Level\n02:35 Best Harder Level\n03:09 Best Insane Level\n03:45 Best Easy Demon\n04:20 Best Medium Demon\n04:55 Best Hard Demon\n05:31 Best Insane Demon\n06:09 Best Extreme Demon\n06:42 Best Streamer\n07:20 Best YouTuber\n07:59 Best Video\n08:32 Best Creator\n09:08 Best Player\n09:47 2023 Levels Montage\n13:15 Credits\n\n© 2024 RobTopGames"

The rope, wrapped around the rotor, is pulled down and back via the stick on the power stroke, tightening and causing the rotor to spin clockwise. The stick is then lifted up towards the rotor and pushed forward on the return stroke, loosening the ropes grip around the rotor, allowing it to continue to spin in the same direction due to its momentum. The cycle is then repeated producing uninterrupted, one way, high speed rotation.\n\nUntil now the blowers I made intermittently spun clockwise, stopped, and then turned anti clockwise driven either by a stick and rope mechanism or by a string passed over a groove in the top of the rotor (see start of video). Energy was wasted each time the rotation was halted and reversed. This also meant that only symmetrical blower housings could be used, more efficient volute shaped housings could not.  But with the new operating technique producing one way rotation, a volute shaped housing was built and tested, working as intended. \n\nThe other change to the blower was that it is now mounted vertically rather than laid out horizontally. The rotor is suspended between two upright stakes that have a single hole partly bored into each of them. These hold the ends of the rotor, acting as thrust bearings. This simple frame allows the rotor to spin freely.\n\nThe new blower will be used for iron smelting and will be compared with the older blower designs. The potential advantages are better efficiency and ergonomics. Less effort seems to be expended due to the continuous momentum being conserved through each cycle. Also, one hand is left free during use which might be an advantage during forging (i.e. using tongs, adding charcoal etc.). The disadvantage is that it's less portable than the original, the wooden stakes need to be driven into soft ground meaning there's less places it can be used. But this is a negligible issue if the forging area is permanent. \n\nContents:\n00:00 Current blower design (spins both ways)\n00:35 Frame for new blower \n03:33 Making rope\n05:28 Making fan spokes\n07:10 Setting up the mechanism\n07:35 One way spinning technique\n08:33 Fan blades\n09:40 Test with old symmetrical housing\n14:29 Making new volute shaped housing\n21:57 Setting up new housing\n23:52 Testing with new housing\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

The rotor is suspended between two upright stakes that have a single hole partly bored into each of them. These hold the ends of the rotor, acting as thrust bearings. This simple frame allows the rotor to spin freely.\n\nThe new blower will be used for iron smelting and will be compared with the older blower designs. The potential advantages are better efficiency and ergonomics. Less effort seems to be expended due to the continuous momentum being conserved through each cycle. Also, one hand is left free during use which might be an advantage during forging (i.e. using tongs, adding charcoal etc.). The disadvantage is that it's less portable than the original, the wooden stakes need to be driven into soft ground meaning there's less places it can be used. But this is a negligible issue if the forging area is permanent. \n\nContents:\n00:00 Current blower design (spins both ways)\n00:35 Frame for new blower \n03:33 Making rope\n05:28 Making fan spokes\n07:10 Setting up the mechanism\n07:35 One way spinning technique\n08:33 Fan blades\n09:40 Test with old symmetrical housing\n14:29 Making new volute shaped housing\n21:57 Setting up new housing\n23:52 Testing with new housing\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n\n#PrimitiveTechnology #ForgeBlower #Pyrotechnics"
