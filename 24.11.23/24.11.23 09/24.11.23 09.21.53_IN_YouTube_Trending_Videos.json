            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \n#HowToTrainYourDragon",

The mega drama boasts a star-studded cast led by Wahaj Ali and Maya Ali. Written by the renowned Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar and directed by the acclaimed Haseeb Hasan, Sunn Mere Dil promises to be a one-of-a-kind drama.\n\nSunn Mere Dil is a tale in which love finds a new meaning, where one person’s devotion quietly flourishes, often unnoticed.

Yet, in their silent sacrifices, they realize that true love is not about\npossession but about selflessness.\n\nEvery unspoken gesture and unseen act of kindness brings them fulfillment, as they put their beloved’s happiness above their own, showing that love is not just about being together, it’s about redefining happiness, even at the expense of their contentment.\n\n7th Sky Entertainment Presentation\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nDirector: Haseeb Hasan\nWriter: Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar\n\nCast:\n\nWahaj Ali as Bilal Abdullah \nMaya Ali as Sadaf\nUsama Khan as Ammar\nHira Mani as Hamsha\nAmar Khan as Dania\nSaba Hameed as Farzana\nSyed Mohammed Ahmed as Namdaar\nShahvir Kadwani as Zaviyaar\n\n#SunnMeraDil\n#WahajAli\n#MayaAli",

The mega drama boasts a star-studded cast led by Wahaj Ali and Maya Ali. Written by the renowned Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar and directed by the acclaimed Haseeb Hasan, Sunn Mere Dil promises to be a one-of-a-kind drama.\n\nSunn Mere Dil is a tale in which love finds a new meaning, where one person’s devotion quietly flourishes, often unnoticed.

The mega drama boasts a star-studded cast led by Wahaj Ali and Maya Ali. Written by the renowned Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar and directed by the acclaimed Haseeb Hasan, Sunn Mere Dil promises to be a one-of-a-kind drama.\n\nSunn Mere Dil is a tale in which love finds a new meaning, where one person’s devotion quietly flourishes, often unnoticed. Their heart beats for someone who may never truly understand the depth of their feelings. Yet, in their silent sacrifices, they realize that true love is not about\npossession but about selflessness.\n\nEvery unspoken gesture and unseen act of kindness brings them fulfillment, as they put their beloved’s happiness above their own, showing that love is not just about being together, it’s about redefining happiness, even at the expense of their contentment.\n\n7th Sky Entertainment Presentation\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nDirector: Haseeb Hasan\nWriter: Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar\n\nCast:\n\nWahaj Ali as Bilal Abdullah \nMaya Ali as Sadaf\nUsama Khan as Ammar\nHira Mani as Hamsha\nAmar Khan as Dania\nSaba Hameed as Farzana\nSyed Mohammed Ahmed as Namdaar\nShahvir Kadwani as Zaviyaar\n\n#glowingmomentsbylux\n#HappilacPaints \n#colorsofhappiness \n#Blessocosmetics\n\n\n#SunnMeraDil\n#WahajAli\n#MayaAli",

The mega drama boasts a star-studded cast led by Wahaj Ali and Maya Ali. Written by the renowned Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar and directed by the acclaimed Haseeb Hasan, Sunn Mere Dil promises to be a one-of-a-kind drama.\n\nSunn Mere Dil is a tale in which love finds a new meaning, where one person’s devotion quietly flourishes, often unnoticed.

Yet, in their silent sacrifices, they realize that true love is not about\npossession but about selflessness.\n\nEvery unspoken gesture and unseen act of kindness brings them fulfillment, as they put their beloved’s happiness above their own, showing that love is not just about being together, it’s about redefining happiness, even at the expense of their contentment.\n\n7th Sky Entertainment Presentation\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nDirector: Haseeb Hasan\nWriter: Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar\n\nCast:\n\nWahaj Ali as Bilal Abdullah \nMaya Ali as Sadaf\nUsama Khan as Ammar\nHira Mani as Hamsha\nAmar Khan as Dania\nSaba Hameed as Farzana\nSyed Mohammed Ahmed as Namdaar\nShahvir Kadwani as Zaviyaar\n\n#glowingmomentsbylux\n#HappilacPaints \n#colorsofhappiness \n#Blessocosmetics\n\n\n#SunnMeraDil\n#WahajAli\n#MayaAli"

            "description": "Get ready to craft your world. #MinecraftMovie - only in theaters 2025. \n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. \n\nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge. \n\nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, blocky wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. \n\nOscar nominee Hess (“Ninety-Five Senses,” “Nacho Libre”) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing. \n\nThe director’s creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (“127 Hours,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “The Meg”), editor James Thomas (“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu”, the “Borat” films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (“The Jungle Book,” “The Batman”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“The Meg,” “What We Do in the Shadows”). Casting is by Rachel Tenner. The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (“Thor: Ragnarok,” the “LEGO®” movies). \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Mojäng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, “A Minecraft Movie.” The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025.",
