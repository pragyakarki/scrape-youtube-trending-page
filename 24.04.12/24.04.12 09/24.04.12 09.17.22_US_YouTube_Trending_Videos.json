Based on the New York Times bestseller, Dark Matter premieres May 8. https://apple.co/_DarkMatter\n\nDark Matter is a sci-fi thriller series based on the blockbuster book by acclaimed, bestselling author Blake Crouch. The nine-episode series features an ensemble cast that includes Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Connelly, Alice Braga, Jimmi Simpson, Dayo Okeniyi and Oakes Fegley. Dark Matter makes its global debut on Apple TV+ on May 8, 2024, premiering with the first two episodes, followed by new episodes every Wednesday through June 26.\n\nHailed as one of the best sci-fi novels of the decade, Dark Matter is a story about the road not taken. The series will follow Jason Dessen (played by Joel Edgerton), a physicist, professor and family man who — one night while walking home on the streets of Chicago — is abducted into an alternate version of his life. Wonder quickly turns to nightmare when he tries to return to his reality amid the mind-bending landscape of lives he could have lived. In this labyrinth of realities, he embarks on a harrowing journey to get back to his true family and save them from the most terrifying, unbeatable foe imaginable: himself.\n\nCrouch serves as executive producer, showrunner, and writer alongside executive producers Matt Tolmach and David Manpearl for Matt Tolmach Productions, and Joel Edgerton.

He’s a giant toy dog who was captured by Catnap and imprisoned in a jail cell… and his legs were tragically ripped off. His design and scene in the game is pretty creepy and insane, so after making our DIY animatronic Catnap, we knew a hanging Dog Day animatronic had to be next.\n\nWe started by making some fake walls in the style of theatrical flats to act as his jail cell. His frame was made of steel and powered by pneumatics, thanks to the help of Hallucinations Creations who make amazing pneumatic animatronic mechs for the haunted house industry. We used wire, duct tape, and foam to make the shape of his body and covered the whole thing in shaggy fur. His head was custom 3D modeled and 3D printed. The whole thing was animated with a prop controller from Purgatory Props.\n\nWe love how our real life DogDay turned out! He’s an awesome pneumatic prop and he's going to make the perfect companion to our growing collection of custom Halloween animatronics like our Catnap, Huggy Wuggy and Springtrap animatronics. Who do you want to see us make next? And where do we put this giant prop now?!\n\nThanks for watching and Stay Wicked, y’all!\n\n#DogDay\n#PoppyPlaytime\n#Animatronics",

He’s a giant toy dog who was captured by Catnap and imprisoned in a jail cell… and his legs were tragically ripped off. His design and scene in the game is pretty creepy and insane, so after making our DIY animatronic Catnap, we knew a hanging Dog Day animatronic had to be next.\n\nWe started by making some fake walls in the style of theatrical flats to act as his jail cell. His frame was made of steel and powered by pneumatics, thanks to the help of Hallucinations Creations who make amazing pneumatic animatronic mechs for the haunted house industry. We used wire, duct tape, and foam to make the shape of his body and covered the whole thing in shaggy fur. His head was custom 3D modeled and 3D printed. The whole thing was animated with a prop controller from Purgatory Props.\n\nWe love how our real life DogDay turned out! He’s an awesome pneumatic prop and he's going to make the perfect companion to our growing collection of custom Halloween animatronics like our Catnap, Huggy Wuggy and Springtrap animatronics. Who do you want to see us make next? And where do we put this giant prop now?!\n\nThanks for watching and Stay Wicked, y’all!\n\n#DogDay\n#PoppyPlaytime\n#Animatronics"

It comes standard with a 2.4L turbo 4-cylinder engine making 278 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, but the i-FORCE MAX option adds a hybrid powertrain which is good for 326 horsepower and a strong 465 lb-ft of torque.

Built less than a year ago, the thatch had deteriorated due to moth larvae and mold consuming it. The rain got through and rotted the lashings holding the roof up and it collapsed. In contrast to this, the brick and wood ash cement hut still stands after 2 years due to the permanent building materials. A second smaller thatched hut was built to continue the brick making process but even that was made difficult by the weather with that thatch rotting in less than a month. In the long term, a workshop made of permanent materials, similar to the main brick and wood ash cement hut, will have to be built in order to continue production of ceramic materials. The problem is that there needs to be such a structure to produce the building materials needed to build that very structure.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

            "description": "GloRilla brings her vibrant energy to Club Shay Shay, discussing her latest hit song and her journey from Memphis to the music industry limelight. She opens up about her new album, navigating the balance between confidence and self-consciousness, and the influence of Yo Gotti's mentorship on her career trajectory after signing to his Memphis based label, CMG. GloRilla shares candidly about the pressure and overthinking that comes with releasing new music, but also the liberating feeling of letting go of expectations and doing things for the approval of herself rather than others. In a hilarious moment, she convinces Shannon to try wine for the first time, adding a touch of spontaneity to the conversation. GloRilla reflects on how haters fuel her determination and reveals her strategy for handling criticism with the support of friends and family. From Michael Jackson to Katt Williams, GloRilla dives into the commercial expectations of the entertainment industry while sharing anecdotes about meeting LeBron James and her admiration for Kobe Bryant. She candidly discusses her love for the Pittsburgh Steelers and why Shannon was once an opp of hers, the ideal first date, and her unique family dynamics, including her supposed cousins Lil Uzi Vert, Cardi B, and Tiger Woods. GloRilla’s upbringing with 10 siblings was much different than most, and she dives into her mother’s extremely religious background and why she was never allowed to have friends over as a child. From her Top 5 rappers of all time to who she wants to collab most with in the music industry, GloRilla shares all of her feelings for the music industry. From her failed experiment as a weed dealer to working numerous odd jobs to becoming one of the hottest names in the rap game, GloRilla's journey is filled with humor, heart, and a raw authenticity that shines through in every story she shares on this episode of Club Shay Shay.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #glorilla #hiphop  \n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

            "description": "Welcome to Episode 3 of Mind the Game with LeBron James and JJ Redick. In this episode, JJ and LeBron talk about adapting and evolving with the game of basketball. Each of them discuss lessons they learned in high school that helped shape the rest of their careers. Next the guys talk about college basketball and whether LeBron ever wishes he could've played in the NCAA tournament / March Madness. Then the guys move on to talk about LeBron's first NBA basket and the way the game has changed from way back then to today. JJ goes on to discuss the impact of the 2009 Orlando Magic and why Stan Van Gundy's offense was revolutionary at the time. The rest of the conversation centers around LeBron's time with Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat. They talk through how the team recovered from the 2011 NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks and Coach Erik Spoelstra's innovation that led to NBA championships and how Chris Bosh had to sacrifice for the good of the team. Then we take a beat to appreciate how Chris Bosh influenced many of today's big men like Bam Adebayo, Nikola Jokic and Chet Holmgren. This is such a fun episode so let's get to it. \n\nSubscribe to Mind the Game with LeBron James (The Los Angeles Lakers) and JJ Redick today for more NBA insight, analysis, highlights and more.\n\n#nba #lebronjames #mindthegame",

                "description": "Welcome to Episode 3 of Mind the Game with LeBron James and JJ Redick. In this episode, JJ and LeBron talk about adapting and evolving with the game of basketball. Each of them discuss lessons they learned in high school that helped shape the rest of their careers. Next the guys talk about college basketball and whether LeBron ever wishes he could've played in the NCAA tournament / March Madness. Then the guys move on to talk about LeBron's first NBA basket and the way the game has changed from way back then to today. JJ goes on to discuss the impact of the 2009 Orlando Magic and why Stan Van Gundy's offense was revolutionary at the time. The rest of the conversation centers around LeBron's time with Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat. They talk through how the team recovered from the 2011 NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks and Coach Erik Spoelstra's innovation that led to NBA championships and how Chris Bosh had to sacrifice for the good of the team. Then we take a beat to appreciate how Chris Bosh influenced many of today's big men like Bam Adebayo, Nikola Jokic and Chet Holmgren. This is such a fun episode so let's get to it. \n\nSubscribe to Mind the Game with LeBron James (The Los Angeles Lakers) and JJ Redick today for more NBA insight, analysis, highlights and more.\n\n#nba #lebronjames #mindthegame"

In 2023, the actress-singer shaped the culture for the better as Ariel in Disney’s live action reboot of ‘The Little Mermaid.’ Her and her sister Chlöe have been associated with the mouse for over a decade, winning Radio Disney competitions and starring on the channel’s teen shows. You know who’s been a fan from the jump? Queen Bey herself, who brought the Bailey’s on tour and signed them to her Parkwood label. Tastemakers really started paying attention in 2020 when the sibs dropped their debut R&B album ‘Ungodly Hour.’ In rolled GRAMMY awards and a fresh wave of R&B fans. When it came time for the girls to set out on solo endeavors, they led with grace. Halle focused first on acting, then pivoted back to her music with the release of the contemplative spiritual “Angel.” Importantly, it showed this 24-year-old wasn’t afraid to make serious statements. In our studio, she was literally and figuratively giving mother: her baby child was in her arms for soundcheck, her performance of “In Your Hands” spreading a maternal message.
