This ENHANCED edition introduces a large volume of newly added and redrawn cuts, as well as a reconstructed narrative. With cutting-edge visual expression, the series delivers even more immersive battle scenes and a more faithful representation of the original manga—bringing an ENHANCED edition to life like never before.\n\nSeveral years have passed since the fierce battle against Majin Buu, and Earth has finally regained a brief moment of peace. At the same time, Beerus, the God of Destruction, awakens from his long, deep sleep. Even Kai and Supreme Kai, aware of Beerus’s overwhelming power to destroy entire planets, watch his awakening with great fear… Meanwhile, Beerus hears rumors of a Saiyan who defeated Frieza—and suddenly appears before Goku.\nTargeted by Beerus, the strongest being in the universe, Earth is in grave danger.

Will we AT LAST move on to 6 hunters?\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dream\n\nBadBoyHalo: @thesaintsofgames \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \nAntfrost: @Antfrost \nawesamdude: @awesamdude \n\nSeed: 935327412\nVersion: 1.21.11\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is FIVE hunters. The 6th rendition of the 5 hunters series, the revival...\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21.11 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friends George and Sapnap and BadBoyHalo and Antfrost  and Awesamdude try to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\n(Most) Music is from: @dreamproductionsXD \n\n#MinecraftManhunt"

So If you ever counted me out, this is your reminder that I’m still here, sharper, more focused, and moving strictly independent.\nHit play, let this run front to back, and if you rock with it, share it, comment, and let the world know YGMFU."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

                "description": "Today I start over as a noob in escape tsunami for brainrots. Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN MERCH: https://foltyn.shop/\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."

In this run, despite several early Voucher skips, both my Vouchers and econ seemed to be limiting but a natural Negative Oops! All Sixes! and a Reserved Parking combined to extend the run long enough to have a chance at picking up the remaining Vouchers. Enjoy the video!\n\nBalatro is a poker roguelike deck building game centered around creating powerful synergies and winning with big hands. In it, you can combine valid poker hands with unique Jokers in order to create varied synergies and builds. No real money is involved, but you can earn enough chips to beat blinds, including challenging boss blinds, to make it to the next ante and progress your run!\n\nJoker popup visual mod by https://www.twitch.tv/edalo\n\nBroadcasted live on Twitch -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/roffle\n\nLike and Subscribe for more videos!\n\nEnjoy the gameplay!\n\n#balatro #Gaming #Roffle",
