This ENHANCED edition introduces a large volume of newly added and redrawn cuts, as well as a reconstructed narrative. With cutting-edge visual expression, the series delivers even more immersive battle scenes and a more faithful representation of the original manga—bringing an ENHANCED edition to life like never before.\n\nSeveral years have passed since the fierce battle against Majin Buu, and Earth has finally regained a brief moment of peace. At the same time, Beerus, the God of Destruction, awakens from his long, deep sleep. Even Kai and Supreme Kai, aware of Beerus’s overwhelming power to destroy entire planets, watch his awakening with great fear… Meanwhile, Beerus hears rumors of a Saiyan who defeated Frieza—and suddenly appears before Goku.\nTargeted by Beerus, the strongest being in the universe, Earth is in grave danger. Thus begins an Earth-shattering cosmic battle between the God of Destruction and Goku and his allies—a conflict that will shake the entire universe.\n\nOriginal Work, Story & Character Design: Akira Toriyama\n \n■Dragon Ball Super: Beerus Official Website https://dragonball-super.com/en/\n■Anime Dragon Ball Official X　                    https://x.com/DB_anime_info\n■DRAGON BALL Official Website                      https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/\n■DRAGON BALL Official X 　                          https://x.com/DB_official_en\n\n©BIRD STUDIO/SHUEISHA, TOEI ANIMATION",

Will we AT LAST move on to 6 hunters?\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dream\n\nBadBoyHalo: @thesaintsofgames \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \nAntfrost: @Antfrost \nawesamdude: @awesamdude \n\nSeed: 935327412\nVersion: 1.21.11\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is FIVE hunters. The 6th rendition of the 5 hunters series, the revival...\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21.11 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friends George and Sapnap and BadBoyHalo and Antfrost  and Awesamdude try to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\n(Most) Music is from: @dreamproductionsXD \n\n#MinecraftManhunt"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

                "description": "With the triumphant return of Leon Kennedy, Resident Evil Requiem is forced to straddle an awkward line between all-out action and methodical survival horror. I’ll be honest, before getting my hands on the game and seeing the transition in action, I was extremely sceptical that Capcom would be able to create a coherent experience involving both Leon and Grace, the series’ latest, highly vulnerable protagonist. But I’m pleased to share that, from my all-too-brief three hours of Resident Evil Requiem hands-on time, not only does this design really, really work, but there’s a lot more going on than just a merging of Resident Evil’s greatest hits.\n\n#ign #residentevil #residentevilrequiem"

The only way to beat him, is to bring Wemmbu back to spawn and prove that he's been lying this whole time. This is 2 Minecraft Pros VS 1000 Hunters. \n\nUnstable SMP:\n➜ ‪  @wemmbumc \n➜ ‪  @FlameFragsMC \n➜ ‪  @Spokeishere \n➜ ‪  @ParrotX2 \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable SMP series, where he is escaping Paragon / Proton: Minecraft's Most Secure Prison, or got hunted by a Minecraft Player who doesn't exist. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with Wemmbu, FlameFrags, or Spoke. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @wemmbumc @LettuceK @TheobaldTheBird @CoinMonkeExtras @PurpledMC @Boosfer \n\nOriginal music by  @tsynphonia \n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags tell stories in Minecraft.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­-to-­be­-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #TheStrongestBattlegrounds #SaitamaBattlegrounds #BloxFruits #BloxFruit #Anime #OnePunchMan #OnePiece #xDemon",

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­-to-­be­-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #TheStrongestBattlegrounds #SaitamaBattlegrounds #BloxFruits #BloxFruit #Anime #OnePunchMan #OnePiece #xDemon"
