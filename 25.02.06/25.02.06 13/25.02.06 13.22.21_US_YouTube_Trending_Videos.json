Watch the Jurassic World Rebirth trailer now. \n\n-----\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@jurassicworld\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jurassicworld\nX: https://twitter.com/jurassicworld\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jurassicworld\nOfficial Site: https://www.jurassicworld.com/\n\nA new era is born. This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

The player uses various units, representing military and civilian units, to explore the map, grow their civilization through additional cities, culture, and technology, gather resources from the geography around their settlements, and defeat threats from foreign civilizations also attempting to grow. The player can win the game through a range of possible victory conditions, ranging from peaceful solutions to full military domination of the world.\n\nThis is NOT sponsored but if you do want to grab the game here is a steam link. Or you can wait for a sale a few months after release: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/\n\nChapters:\n00:00 It’s Finally Time!\n3:28 The Exploit\n4:23 Exploring and Expanding\n8:15 Only Good Things\n12:15 Does this mean war?\n15:03 The ball is rolling\n18:13 A race against Time\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: Sword.

Throughout this we'll be talking about the main comics that inspired it along with what stories we've heard theyre adapting.\n\nIt's february 4th which is an F and a 4 and though there's been trailers shown privately at events, this adds a lot in. That was put together really quickly and was mainly made up from costume tests, special effects reels and what theyd managed to film so far.\n\nHowever we will also be going over what happened in that one if you havent seen it and this is kind of our mega breakdown about everything you need to know.\n\nSo come with us as we explain first steps first look and lets get into the trailer.\n\n-\n\nNow we begin with an hour long countdown which I rushed home for and the wife wasn't happy BUT after that we get into the trailer.\n\nAnd by that I mean another live event.\n\nBUT AFTER THAT we get into the trailer.\n\nBeginning with a tour of the baxter building we watch Reed and Sue guiding someone about the house.\n\nIts very akin to the hickman run in which theyd often give tours. This too featured in Civil War and its pretty much just the family showing the world who they are.\n\nTheyre pretty much celebrities so its kind of like a 1960s reality tv thing. Shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio it also feels like a classic tv show.\n\nNow the films obviously gonna have a very heavy 60s retro futuristic aesthetic.\n\nThe movies gonna be set in 1963 but I do feel like theyll be pulled into the modern day...or maybe across the multiverse.\n\nHowever, If youve read the original run of the comics it all feels really inline with that. Its kind of like a Jetsons thing set in the past where they have really high tech things but also a sixties style to it.",

Throughout this we'll be talking about the main comics that inspired it along with what stories we've heard theyre adapting.\n\nIt's february 4th which is an F and a 4 and though there's been trailers shown privately at events, this adds a lot in. That was put together really quickly and was mainly made up from costume tests, special effects reels and what theyd managed to film so far.\n\nHowever we will also be going over what happened in that one if you havent seen it and this is kind of our mega breakdown about everything you need to know.\n\nSo come with us as we explain first steps first look and lets get into the trailer.\n\n-\n\nNow we begin with an hour long countdown which I rushed home for and the wife wasn't happy BUT after that we get into the trailer.\n\nAnd by that I mean another live event.\n\nBUT AFTER THAT we get into the trailer.\n\nBeginning with a tour of the baxter building we watch Reed and Sue guiding someone about the house.\n\nIts very akin to the hickman run in which theyd often give tours. This too featured in Civil War and its pretty much just the family showing the world who they are.\n\nTheyre pretty much celebrities so its kind of like a 1960s reality tv thing. Shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio it also feels like a classic tv show.\n\nNow the films obviously gonna have a very heavy 60s retro futuristic aesthetic.\n\nThe movies gonna be set in 1963 but I do feel like theyll be pulled into the modern day...or maybe across the multiverse.\n\nHowever, If youve read the original run of the comics it all feels really inline with that. Its kind of like a Jetsons thing set in the past where they have really high tech things but also a sixties style to it."

Go to https://www.RocketMoney.com/sarian to get started for free!\n\n__________\n\nHi friends, happy Monday! \n\nJoan Little, a young Black woman, made headlines in the 1970s. That's because...\n\n... alone in her cold, dark jail cell... she faced an unthinkable choice: submit to her attacker or fight for her life. And what happened next led to a trial that had America in a complete chokehold and changed legal history forever.\n\nWhat led to that fateful night in a small-town North Carolina jail? Did Joan go too far? And how did her trial spark a nationwide uproar over race, gender, and the fight for self-defense rights?\n\nThis is the groundbreaking story of Joan Little.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon.\nxo \nBailey Sarian\n\nI sometimes talk about my Good Reads in the show.

            "description": "Former world champion Isaac “Pitbull” Cruz (27-3-1, 18 KOs) edges out all-action contender Angel Fierro (23-3-2, 18 KOs) via unanimous decision (98-92, 97-93, 96-94) after 10 rounds of super lightweight action in an instant 2025 Fight of the Year contender that saw the fighters combine to throw 1,410 punches.\n \n\"I came here to fight and show the world the best of what I can do and I think I did that,” said Cruz. “I entertained the crowd and gave them a show. I'm so happy that I gave the fans a great fight with a lot of pressure like I always do and I'm proud to do it with my family here watching.”\n \n\"I came here to give the fans a great fight and leave it all in the ring,” said Fierro. “I don't care about the judges, I care about the fans. But I do hope that 'Pitbull' gives me a rematch, because I think I deserve it.”\n \nCruz and Fierro lived up to their promise to give the fans an “all-out Mexican war” as they went toe-to-toe from the opening bell, throwing powerful shots right from the outset. Mexico City’s Cruz set the tone with a huge first round, landing over 50% of his shots, including a career-best 39 power shots.\n \nTijuana’s Fierro struck back in round three, landing a powerful right hook to the temple that knocked Cruz off balance and grabbed his attention, eventually leading to a wild final minute of the round that saw both fighters land huge blows. With the back-and-forth nature of the fight set early, both continued to fight in close range until the final bell.\n \nFierro was able to keep up his impressive activity throughout the fight, throwing 786 punches to Cruz’s 624, while Cruz out landed Fierro 248 to 238. True to form, the two combatants spent the final two rounds in a pitched toe-to-toe battle that ended with the crowd on its feet in appreciation for what they had witnessed.\n \n\"I trained for eight weeks and worked really hard to leave everything in the ring,” said Fierro. “My name will stand forever, because Angel Fierro did his thing tonight. I went into the ring with determination and I fought with my heart. We showed everything that Mexican boxing is all about tonight.\"\n \n\"Fierro deserves all the respect in the world and I take my hat off to him,” said Cruz. “Thank you to all the fans who came to support me, because that's who I fight for.\"\n\n#IsaacCruz  #CruzFierro #AngelFierro \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

And this time she’s not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon—led by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and director Gerard Johnstone—reboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0.\n\nTwo years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on a murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently destroyed, M3GAN’s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma’s niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma’s overprotective rules. \n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy.
