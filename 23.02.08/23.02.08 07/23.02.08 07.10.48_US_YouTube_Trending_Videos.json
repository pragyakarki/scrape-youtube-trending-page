            "description": "And why the US and China are fighting over silicon in the first place.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn October 2022, the Biden administration placed a large-scale ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to China. They also implemented a series of other rules that prevents China from making these chips on their own. These chips are used in everyday technology, like our mobile phones and computers. They’re also crucial to military and intelligence systems, which is one of the main reasons they're at the center of a feud between the United States and China. \n\nMicrochips were first invented in the US in the 1950s, after which their use rapidly expanded worldwide. Since then, the supply chain for these chips has grown and spread to include countries in Europe and Asia. And while some countries have caught up to the US's edge in making these advanced chips, China still falls far behind despite multiple attempts to gain an advantage.\n\nWatch the latest episode of Vox Atlas to understand why China is losing a new cold war with the US over microchips.\n\nSources and further reading: \n\nWe found this book written by Chris Miller very helpful for understanding the history of chip development in the US and the foreign policy behind its competition and feud with China: \n\nChip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002 \n\nThis book gave us great context on China’s efforts to acquire foreign technology: \n\nChinese Industrial Espionage by Anna Puglisi\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Books-Anna-B-Puglisi/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AAnna+B.+Puglisi\n\nArticles like this by Chien-Huei Wu helped us learn more about how much the US replies on east asian countries for successful technology:\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2022/05/east-asian-firms-are-critical-to-americas-semiconductor-success/\n\nReporting by Bloomberg helped us understand major IP theft cases related to semiconductor chips: \nhttps://cset.georgetown.edu/article/engineer-who-fled-charges-of-stealing-chip-technology-in-us-now-thrives-in-china/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                "description": "And why the US and China are fighting over silicon in the first place.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn October 2022, the Biden administration placed a large-scale ban on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to China. They also implemented a series of other rules that prevents China from making these chips on their own. These chips are used in everyday technology, like our mobile phones and computers. They’re also crucial to military and intelligence systems, which is one of the main reasons they're at the center of a feud between the United States and China. \n\nMicrochips were first invented in the US in the 1950s, after which their use rapidly expanded worldwide. Since then, the supply chain for these chips has grown and spread to include countries in Europe and Asia. And while some countries have caught up to the US's edge in making these advanced chips, China still falls far behind despite multiple attempts to gain an advantage.\n\nWatch the latest episode of Vox Atlas to understand why China is losing a new cold war with the US over microchips.\n\nSources and further reading: \n\nWe found this book written by Chris Miller very helpful for understanding the history of chip development in the US and the foreign policy behind its competition and feud with China: \n\nChip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002 \n\nThis book gave us great context on China’s efforts to acquire foreign technology: \n\nChinese Industrial Espionage by Anna Puglisi\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Books-Anna-B-Puglisi/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AAnna+B.+Puglisi\n\nArticles like this by Chien-Huei Wu helped us learn more about how much the US replies on east asian countries for successful technology:\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2022/05/east-asian-firms-are-critical-to-americas-semiconductor-success/\n\nReporting by Bloomberg helped us understand major IP theft cases related to semiconductor chips: \nhttps://cset.georgetown.edu/article/engineer-who-fled-charges-of-stealing-chip-technology-in-us-now-thrives-in-china/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

All engines compared for fuel efficiency, oil consumption, noise and vibration during a 48-hour test. Used oil samples sent to an oil testing lab to provide information on wear metals. Engines also compared for torque and horsepower. I bought the engines, fuel to test the engines and all supplies to ensure an unbiased review.

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada.

We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.

However, the shock and sadness of sudden death might be too much for loved ones to bear, and their reactions will vary depending on the individual.This Swahili sentimental elegy, titled Zuwena, tells the story of a woman whose life takes a dark turn following the death of her spouse. The lady's brother-in-law, Diamond Platnumz, is having a broken-hearted telepathic conversation with his late brother about the new woman Zuwena has become, and all the hardships she has put them through, including spending all the money, not being there for her mother-in-law, becoming a hussy, and living an extravagant lifestyle.For your listening pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, we present Zuwena, exemplifying the kind of song delivery and performance that has kept Diamond as Platnumz for over a decade.\n\nVideo Shot by Directo Ivan\n\nDiamond Platnumz Booking Info:\nEmail:bookplatnumz@gmail.com | sallam.sharaff@gmail.com\n\nCatch Up With Diamond Platnumz On:\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/diamondplatnumz/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/DiamondPlatnumz255/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/diamondplatnumz/\n\n#Diamondplatnumz #wasafi #music",

However, the shock and sadness of sudden death might be too much for loved ones to bear, and their reactions will vary depending on the individual.This Swahili sentimental elegy, titled Zuwena, tells the story of a woman whose life takes a dark turn following the death of her spouse. The lady's brother-in-law, Diamond Platnumz, is having a broken-hearted telepathic conversation with his late brother about the new woman Zuwena has become, and all the hardships she has put them through, including spending all the money, not being there for her mother-in-law, becoming a hussy, and living an extravagant lifestyle.For your listening pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, we present Zuwena, exemplifying the kind of song delivery and performance that has kept Diamond as Platnumz for over a decade.\n\nVideo Shot by Directo Ivan\n\nDiamond Platnumz Booking Info:\nEmail:bookplatnumz@gmail.com | sallam.sharaff@gmail.com\n\nCatch Up With Diamond Platnumz On:\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/diamondplatnumz/\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/DiamondPlatnumz255/\nTwitter:https://twitter.com/diamondplatnumz/\n\n#Diamondplatnumz #wasafi #music"

            "description": "Hey guys! today I am going to be unboxing a bunch of used, damaged squishies that have been sent to me from you guys! I plan on using some of these for my squishy makeover series, where I fix and redecorate  old squishies and create custom art creations. Let me know which squishies you think I should use in the next episode in the comments!\n\n\nFOR ANY NEW PEOPLE:\nToday I am going to be opening a bunch of boxes/packages from my subscribers. Basically \"fanmail\" or P.O. box unboxing, BUT most of these packages are used, dirty, old squishies sent to me from people who no longer want them. I like to fix them up, paint over them, customize them and decorate them to create new works of ART for my video series called \"Squishy Makeovers\". Soooooo every once in a while I like to do these videos, looking through all the candidates I've been sent. It's always very interesting seeing which squishies I get and how bad of condition they are. Plus there are some cute extra gifts thrown in from my very generous viewers that are fun to look through. My current P.O. box address is kept private because I have been overloaded with mail in the past, so I only give it out by request to a handful of people each week (email address to request it, bottom of description). The address you see on a lot of the old packages in this video is NOT my current address, I no longer have access to it. Let me know in the comments which squishies you would like to see in the next squishy makeover episode.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here.

Basically \"fanmail\" or P.O. box unboxing, BUT most of these packages are used, dirty, old squishies sent to me from people who no longer want them. I like to fix them up, paint over them, customize them and decorate them to create new works of ART for my video series called \"Squishy Makeovers\". Soooooo every once in a while I like to do these videos, looking through all the candidates I've been sent. It's always very interesting seeing which squishies I get and how bad of condition they are. Plus there are some cute extra gifts thrown in from my very generous viewers that are fun to look through. My current P.O. box address is kept private because I have been overloaded with mail in the past, so I only give it out by request to a handful of people each week (email address to request it, bottom of description).

Dillon Brooks missed a shot driving to the hoop and one of his arms hit Donovan Mitchell while Brooks was on the ground. Mitchell responded by throwing the ball at Brooks and a full scuffle ensued. Both players were ejected and Mitchell did not hold back after the game, saying quote: 'that's just who he is. We've seen it a bunch. Him and I have had our personal battles for years. Quite frankly, I've been busting his *** for years. There's no place for that in the game and you got to protect yourself at the end of the day.'

Cast iron is iron that has a very high carbon content. Its good properties are that it's very hard and has a low melting point. The drawback is that it's relatively brittle compared to regular iron. So I set about trying to find a method for reducing its carbon content.\n\n In this video I smelted local ore (iron bacteria) and obtained cast iron prills. I then tried melting it in a small crucible to obtain a solid ingot to begin the experiment. This gave a poor result though with an incomplete melt. \n\nNext I tried rusting the prills first with the intent of creating iron oxide (rust ) in the iron so that the next melt would combine the materials in an exothermic reaction that would burn the carbon out. In the past, rusty iron was added to cast iron to decarburize it (wet puddling/pig boiling). But this also gave poor results.\n\n Finally, I did away with the mold and simply melted the iron prills by dropping them into the forge in front of the hot air blast of the forge. The reasoning was that the high oxygen would burn out the carbon from the metal. This caused them to melt together to form an ingot. After a few attempts I took one of the ingots and hammered it while still white to yellow hot and hammered it with a stone. The ingot was able to be flattened as it had become malleable. This was the result I wanted.\n\nThis method of decarburization (melting cast iron in a open hearth to make it malleable) was used throughout history at different times. In ancient China it was known as \"stir fried steel/ 炒钢\" and in the west known as the \"Osmond process\". I also read that in India, cast iron ingots from the crucible were brought to a temperature just below melting point before becoming forgeable. \nIn future experiments I hope to use this technique to decarburize iron ingots to make into forged metal tools as opposed to the cast knife I made in a previous video. \n\nChapters: \n00:00 Overview of my standard smelting process\n00:50 Crucible ingot (failure)\n02:21 Decarburization via rusting (failure)\n04:22 Decarburization without crucible (inconclusive)\n05:45 Decarburization without crucible/forging  (success)\n07:01 Decarburized and forged iron result\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Working hand in hand with AD100 designer Billy Cotton and architect Ben Bischoff of MADE, Lily and David have created an exciting and singular home within their stately late-19th-century brownstone in Carroll Gardens. “Lily is someone who lives with color in a deeper way than most. Her taste is bold, silly, fun, eccentric—it’s exciting,” says the _Stranger Things_ actor and star of the recent blood-splattered Christmas spectacular _Violent Night._ “I’ve always been interested in interiors, and I’ve always done my own homes.
