This ENHANCED edition introduces a large volume of newly added and redrawn cuts, as well as a reconstructed narrative. With cutting-edge visual expression, the series delivers even more immersive battle scenes and a more faithful representation of the original manga—bringing an ENHANCED edition to life like never before.\n\nSeveral years have passed since the fierce battle against Majin Buu, and Earth has finally regained a brief moment of peace. At the same time, Beerus, the God of Destruction, awakens from his long, deep sleep. Even Kai and Supreme Kai, aware of Beerus’s overwhelming power to destroy entire planets, watch his awakening with great fear… Meanwhile, Beerus hears rumors of a Saiyan who defeated Frieza—and suddenly appears before Goku.\nTargeted by Beerus, the strongest being in the universe, Earth is in grave danger.

Will we AT LAST move on to 6 hunters?\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dream\n\nBadBoyHalo: @thesaintsofgames \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \nAntfrost: @Antfrost \nawesamdude: @awesamdude \n\nSeed: 935327412\nVersion: 1.21.11\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is FIVE hunters. The 6th rendition of the 5 hunters series, the revival...\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21.11 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friends George and Sapnap and BadBoyHalo and Antfrost  and Awesamdude try to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\n(Most) Music is from: @dreamproductionsXD \n\n#MinecraftManhunt"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

            "description": "The Super Mario Series has a TON of enemies, but everyone agrees that the absolute best of the best has to be Dry Bones. This skeleton version of the koopa is my favorite character in the franchise, and lucky for me he appears in almost every mainline mario game. However, not every Mario game is equal. Some games like mario 64 and mario sunshine don’t use him at all whereas the new super mario bros series and mario odyssey use him a lot more. So today, I thought it would be fun to rank all 19 mainline mario games based on their usage of dry bones. And as a bonus, I’ll also consider dry bones variants such as fish bones, dry bowser, and many others!\n\nOdyssey Central Twitter: https://twitter.com/odyssey_central\n\nOdyssey Central Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMiOWDKN0wNKHQ4rzGAp6ig/join\n\nOdyssey Central Maker ID: VPB-NM9-KLF\n\nVideos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rn-o3Zch4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKxmjWrkSWQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9OiHu-TViE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@NintendoCentral\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@mtg7386\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@packattack04082\n\nThe Greatest Video Ever Made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSCB8qeJs5o",

                "description": "The Super Mario Series has a TON of enemies, but everyone agrees that the absolute best of the best has to be Dry Bones. This skeleton version of the koopa is my favorite character in the franchise, and lucky for me he appears in almost every mainline mario game. However, not every Mario game is equal. Some games like mario 64 and mario sunshine don’t use him at all whereas the new super mario bros series and mario odyssey use him a lot more. So today, I thought it would be fun to rank all 19 mainline mario games based on their usage of dry bones.

Here's 3 episodes in one video to make up for it!\n\nIn this series,  @TeamSamuraiX1 will wield The Blue Eyes White Dragon, while I wield the Dark Magician. Throughout the series, we will duel against each other, and also enter somewhat of a masochist mode in ranked where we try to enhance out decks between each encounter. Every win, we gain a pack. Every rank up, we gain a card. Which of the two of us will reach MASTER RANK first? We'll have to find out.\n\nThanks as always for the support.
