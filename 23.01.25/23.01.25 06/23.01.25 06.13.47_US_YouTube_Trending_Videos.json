            "description": "For the second straight year, the San Francisco 49ers bounced the Dallas Cowboys from the playoffs with a 19-12 final score. Dak Prescott threw two interceptions in the first half and finished with just over 200 passing yards and one touchdown. The Cowboys last play, with Ezekiel Elliott snapping the ball to Dak, was shut down when KaVontae Turpin was immediately tackled after hauling in the short pass.

However, it seems I'm not alone on this quest, there is a conspiracy brewing of other server members also plotting something mischievous for the End, but what could that be?\n\nThumbnail by: @FrizzMcwizz \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/caBMGtTGh3\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo.

However, it seems I'm not alone on this quest, there is a conspiracy brewing of other server members also plotting something mischievous for the End, but what could that be?\n\nThumbnail by: @FrizzMcwizz \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/caBMGtTGh3\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Reddoons or Doons on other platforms! Enjoy! This was made on LifeSteal SMP Season 4"

The series has had two really good episodes back to back and as a big fan of the game I've loved watching these first two entries. They do change some things up though and throughout the video we're gonna be going over the easter eggs, game differences and also giving our thoughts on the series so far.\n\nHuge thank you to everyone who checked out our video last week and like that one we're gonna be saving the more spoilery easter eggs until the end so that people who haven't played the game can enjoy all the twists and turns that come up in the show. I'll give you a heads up before we hit that and we start the episode off in Jakarta all the way back in 2003.\n\nIf you cast your mind back to last week then you may remember that they did an announcement over the radio that talked about the city and how something strange was going on there. Here we see it playing out with the outbreak of the infection being studied by a doctor. This wasn't in the game and I like how the series is slowly filling in the backstory of the virus. Both the beginning of last episode and this one had completely new bits in them and it's possible that we might even get a new story slotted in at the opening of each entry that gives us way more details on the infection than what we ever got in the game.\n\nWhen the title cards first shown we can see this is taking place on September 24th 2003 dating it two days before the outbreak. This of course shows how fast the virus spread and in the game we learned it was through products contain flour and yeast which we'll talk more about in just a bit. Huge shoutouts to Dyanmic Smurf on our last video for pointing out that 2003 was potentially chosen because it was one of the hottest years on record which a record breaking heat wave happening that killed 20,000 people.\n\nMusic By - PSiMiTAR\n► Youtube Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/user/IamSteesh?sub_confirmation=1\n► Instrumentals - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUFhME-rGtc&list=PLheoTHb8ecX76eFcGiH2mEPIZLK0ETeMb\n► Twitter - https://twitter.com/steeshhaggie\n► Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/steeshhaggie/",

I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

            "description": "Use my code PAOLO15 at https://partner.bokksu.com/paolo15  to get $15 off your first Bokksu Japanese snack box!\n\nThis is a Japan behind the counter food tour of a local Japanese bento shop. For more than 40 years, Bento Kawano has been making delicious Japanese handmade bento lunches at the affordable price of 600yen. At this value and quality it’s no surprise everyday that the customer lunch lines wrap around the entire block.  One important things about this Japanese bento shop is that they must be extra careful about food safety.  Since Bentos are designed to be able to sit on the shelf for several hours without refrigeration, the food must always be fully cooked. Run by Japanese food craftsman, Inoue san, he changes the menu everyday so his customers have something to look forward to.  He particularly enjoys analyzing the performance of his previous bentos and creating new ones to see how popular it will be, but ultimately he says that whatever bento he serves, he creates each one as if he’ll be sharing it with his loved ones. Interestingly, this Tokyo bento shop runs 4 rice cookers simultaneously throughout the entire day to keep up with the demand using a special hitomebore rice from Miyagi prefecture known for its exquisite taste especially when its cooled down.  Even the rice at the shop was specifically selected by Inoue san.  I hope you enjoy this Tokyo Hidden gem bento shop.   \n\nBento Kawano\n- https://goo.gl/maps/LUWZtAGDey1msVFw6\n- https://www.genkigohan.com/\n\nWatch more Japan Behind the Counter videos here\n- https://tokyozebra.com/btc\n\nGet my Tokyo & Japan Merch and show your support! \n- https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch\n\n___ Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ___\nSee My Life in Japan behind the scenes\n- https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra\n\nQuestions about Japan or Japan Travel?
