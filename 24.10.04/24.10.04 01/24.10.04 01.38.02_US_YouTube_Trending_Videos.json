            "description": "A lot of people have been asking how they can help. Here's what I saw October 1st:\n\nI think the area is starting to get saturated with very legitimate help. I'm not sure how many more hands on deck are needed but I could be wrong. Water is the obvious thing needed since water systems have been compromised/contaminated so if you can find a reputable organization to donate to for water and food, that's a good idea. I was in Swannanoa this morning - they were hit HARD. The river swept through there killing people, reducing homes to rubble, and destroying businesses. I saw random people there just setting up tents with water, food, coffee, snacks. I think that's a great idea as people are in clean up mode, exhausted, sad and they need these things - they can't get these items anyway because maybe their car was crushed, their road is washed out, power is out so grocery stores are closed, etc. People need fuel for their generators (lines are hours long at the stations that are open). \n\nThere are communities stuck on top of mountains due to their only line of access being completely destroyed with no hope of it being fixed anytime soon. They're requiring air drops and rescues and these guys seem to be doing a good job if you'd like to donate - Aerial Recovery Group (links below).\n\nI hiked about 6 miles into Bat Cave yesterday heading towards Chimney Rock. I'm not sure what they need because it's gone but like everywhere, they need food, water, gas. I'm hopeful that this whole community evacuated as there is just zero access to Chimney Rock/Lake Lure from the NW anymore. Downstream to Chimney Rock and Lake Lure, it's just a mess. I haven't physically seen it because I couldn't get there but I've seen videos. The clean up is going to be enormous. I do know that helicopters are heavily flying here due to no access so once again, Aerial Recovery and other organizations actively flying there need help (they're actually flying to MANY mountaintops within a couple hours).\n\nWellness checks in the region are a good idea. A friend sent me https://www.unitedway.org/ as a way to sign up to do wellness checks if you're local. I'm not sure how that organization works but it's an idea. You can also look in forums and see people asking about specific addresses.\n\nCrazy thing is, this is just a few communities. Asheville, Hendersonville, Burnsville, this whole region, needs assistance. People are coming to help in big ways now, though. I met a group down in the river today from Myrtle Beach, a search and rescue team. I talked with some Cajun Navy people on side by sides today. The more the merrier. \n\nAerial Recovery Group:\nhttps://secure.givelively.org/.../2024-hurricane-helene...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/aerialrecoverygroup?igsh=MTM2eGY1bXFxcnh6Ng==",

They're requiring air drops and rescues and these guys seem to be doing a good job if you'd like to donate - Aerial Recovery Group (links below).\n\nI hiked about 6 miles into Bat Cave yesterday heading towards Chimney Rock. I'm not sure what they need because it's gone but like everywhere, they need food, water, gas. I'm hopeful that this whole community evacuated as there is just zero access to Chimney Rock/Lake Lure from the NW anymore. Downstream to Chimney Rock and Lake Lure, it's just a mess. I haven't physically seen it because I couldn't get there but I've seen videos. The clean up is going to be enormous. I do know that helicopters are heavily flying here due to no access so once again, Aerial Recovery and other organizations actively flying there need help (they're actually flying to MANY mountaintops within a couple hours).\n\nWellness checks in the region are a good idea. A friend sent me https://www.unitedway.org/ as a way to sign up to do wellness checks if you're local. I'm not sure how that organization works but it's an idea. You can also look in forums and see people asking about specific addresses.\n\nCrazy thing is, this is just a few communities. Asheville, Hendersonville, Burnsville, this whole region, needs assistance. People are coming to help in big ways now, though. I met a group down in the river today from Myrtle Beach, a search and rescue team. I talked with some Cajun Navy people on side by sides today.

Its volume is at least twice as large as all the Earth’s oceans, home to more microbes than the rest of the entire planet.Their total biomass is more than 20 times greater than all humans, livestock, and animal wildlife. \nLet’s descend into this mad, deadly world where none of the rules we thought are mandatory for life apply.\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤️ https://shop.kgs.link\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundCloud: https://bit.ly/4eoauTV\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/3XP5ZdV\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nMario Paunov, Ausar, Kristin Light, Shana Sheehy Niederman, David and Heather Landers, Wael Hasno, David, Edz Gaming, Jonathan Helledie, Darryl, Joan Vinyals Ylla-Català, Geert Lanting, chuck, Hascyll, Cole McCue, Aus, Cole Gallo, Andrew Totsky, Maxwell Rominger, Myles, Qundium, Pál Melis, Craig, xcheat, G33kounet, Rohan Rhodes, Kit Halliday\n\n\nCHAPTERS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n0:00 Intro\n0:55 Going Deeper and Deeper\n4:47 The Most Extreme Living Things\n9:42 KiwiCo Sponsorships\n11:12 Secret Teaser"

            "description": "Israel has carried out what “it called large-scale\" air strikes on Yemen, targeting what it described as “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime”.   Power stations and a port were hit in Ras Isa and Hudaydah.\n\nThe strikes came as Israel carried out more attacks across Lebanon, and Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel.   Israel has again targeted the Beirut suburb of Dahieh, the Hezbollah stronghold where its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed by Israeli bombing.   Israel is now claiming that 20 other senior leaders of the militia were also killed. \n\nLebanon’s prime minister has said that as many as a million people may now have been displaced by the bombing campaign, as people flee north in search of safety. \n\nThere have been more warnings that the escalating conflict risks turning into a full-scale regional war, involving Iran which backs Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nAnna Foster in Beirut presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jon Donnison, Orla Guerin and Frank Gardner. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                "description": "Israel has carried out what “it called large-scale\" air strikes on Yemen, targeting what it described as “military targets of the Houthi terrorist regime”.   Power stations and a port were hit in Ras Isa and Hudaydah.\n\nThe strikes came as Israel carried out more attacks across Lebanon, and Hezbollah fired more rockets into northern Israel.   Israel has again targeted the Beirut suburb of Dahieh, the Hezbollah stronghold where its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed by Israeli bombing.   Israel is now claiming that 20 other senior leaders of the militia were also killed. \n\nLebanon’s prime minister has said that as many as a million people may now have been displaced by the bombing campaign, as people flee north in search of safety. \n\nThere have been more warnings that the escalating conflict risks turning into a full-scale regional war, involving Iran which backs Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nAnna Foster in Beirut presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jon Donnison, Orla Guerin and Frank Gardner. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

            "description": "Iran has threatened to carry out a further “crushing attack” on Israel, after firing 180 ballistic missiles at its regional enemy.\n\nThe latest warning from Iran came after Israel’s Prime Minister said his country would retaliate for the latest Iranian missile strike.   Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet: “Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.”\n\nIran launched the missiles in retaliation for a series of Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and its capital Beirut which killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior commanders of the Iranian-backed militia group. \n\nIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, described the missiles fired at Israel as “a decisive response to the aggression of the Zionist regime”.  It’s reported that the order to launch the missiles was made personally by Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe Iranian attack came after Israel announced a major ground offensive in southern Lebanon. \n\nAnna Foster in Beirut presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jon Donnison, Lucy Williamson, Orla Guerin and Sarah Smith. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                "description": "Iran has threatened to carry out a further “crushing attack” on Israel, after firing 180 ballistic missiles at its regional enemy.\n\nThe latest warning from Iran came after Israel’s Prime Minister said his country would retaliate for the latest Iranian missile strike.   Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet: “Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.”\n\nIran launched the missiles in retaliation for a series of Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and its capital Beirut which killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior commanders of the Iranian-backed militia group. \n\nIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, described the missiles fired at Israel as “a decisive response to the aggression of the Zionist regime”.  It’s reported that the order to launch the missiles was made personally by Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe Iranian attack came after Israel announced a major ground offensive in southern Lebanon. \n\nAnna Foster in Beirut presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jon Donnison, Lucy Williamson, Orla Guerin and Sarah Smith. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

This year, we’re making a life sized real Withered Foxy animatronic, complete with a full endoskeleton. The Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie is currently filming and we’ve been seeing all of these amazing BTS photos of the animatronics, and it inspired us to make our own.\n\nTo make Foxy we’re doing an Halloween animatronic makeover, and we started with a Pirate animatronic from Home Depot called Captain Cuts. He has a ton of servo motors to animate his face and head, and a great pirate swagger that should translate nicely to Foxy the Pirate. \n\nWe carved Foxy’s giant feet and the rest of his endoskeleton out of foam, weathered it, and painted it silver. His suit and head were mostly 3D printed and covered in fleece and faux suede. We had to completely disassemble Capt. Cut’s face and adapt all of the servo mounts to match Foxy’s proportions. \n\nIf you want to see more of our Halloween Decorations and Animatronics tutorials, we have a TON on our channel.\n\nFoxy is going to look great next to our custom Springtrap and Puppet animatronics. Maybe one day we’ll create enough FNAF animatronics to make Five Nights at Freddy’s in real life.

            "description": "Support the channel by shopping through this link: https://amzn.to/3RIqU0u\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/d4a\nBecome a member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwosUnVH6AINmxtqkNJ3Fbg/join\nGrit: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3YSIPcvJsYbwGCDLNiIKA\nLink to the patent: https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/18585308/ifw/docs?application=\n\nJust a few days ago news has surfaced on the internet that Porsche has patented a revolutionary new six stroke engine which according to them has the power benefits of a two stroke engine but the durabtility and emissions cleanliness of a four stroke engine. \n\nAs you probably know traditional four stroke engines which powers virtually every combustion car, truck or motorcycle on the roads today gooes intake, compression, combustion and exhaust.\n\nPorsche new design adds one more combustion and more compression stroke into the mix and so the new engine goes: intake compression combustion compression combustion exhaust. \n\nThis relies on 100% existing technology. Gears, rod, crank, piston. Even the ports which are known as scavenging ports are ancient. Btw, this very arrangement with ports on one side and valves on the other is known as uniflow scavenging. Because the flow goes in a uniform direction through the cylinder. And this is very common on two stroke diesels in ships and locomotives. The six stroke also don’t make any serious problems for the camshafts. Instead of rotating at half the crankshaft speed, the camshafts will now rotate at one-third the crankshaft speed, so we just need a slightly larger cam gear and we also need an additional lobe on the exhaust come and that’s pretty much it, nothing complex. So there are really no novel mechanics in this which means that it doesn’t need heavy investments into research and development to get it to market. \n\nIt does make more power than a traditional four-stroke. If we observe the first 720 degrees of rotation we can see that we get only one combustion event, just like a traditional four-stroke. But if we observe the next 360 degrees we will see another combustion event starting at 720 degrees of rotation. This does not happen in the traditional four-stroke until we reach 1080 degrees of rotation.\n\nSo if we observe let’s say 7200 degrees of rotation, the traditional four-stroke will perform 10 combustion events. The six stroke will perform  13.34 combustion events. So that’s 33.4% more power than a traditional four-stroke. Now, it’s definitely not in two-stroke territory because a two stroke will perform 20 combustion events in 7200 degrees of rotation and that’s 20 equal, proper combustion events. Remember, on the six stroke, every other combustion event is a mix of exhaust gas and air and fuel which means that we’re probably not looking at a power increase of 33.4% but likely something closer to 25%. But 25% more power with existing technology and emissions cleanliness and durability of a traditional four stroke is still a very significant improvement and a very clever and rational way towards more power. \nSomething else this makes possible is to run very high boost pressure and still be relatively emissions-friendly. To run something like 3 bar boost pressure which is 45 psi you need to run very very rich. You make crazy power but you’re also sending some unburned fuel into the atmosphere which means crappy emissions. But in a six-stroke we would not send all that unburned fuel out. We would send just a bit of it out and the rest would be burned during the next combustion stroke. So potentially, big power and government approval. \n\n\nBut why would Porsche patent this now if sales of new combustion vehicles will be banned starting with 2035 in the EU and I believe some other parts of the world.?\n\nWell, here’s the thing, the EU is not fully banning sales of new combustion vehicles starting with 2035. \nOn the 25th of March of 2023 EU reached an agreement with Germany where it was agreed that sales of and registration of new ICE vehicles will be permitted after 2035, provided that those vehicles operate only on carbon-neutral fuels. \n\nSo what this patent means is that Porsche is taking preventive measures to ensure that it can produce high-power and emissions-friendly engines that can still fit inside the back of a 911 in case e-fuel production ramps up before 2035. By patenting this design Porsche ensures that nobody else can implement it without paying fees to them.\n\nSo will we see this engine in the future? Well, if e-fuel production does actually ramp up, I think it’s likely that Porsche will greenlight some sort of project. Will e-fuel be expensive? Probably. But I doubt that’s a major problem for Porsche buyers. \n\nA special thank you to my patrons:\nDaniel\nMarwan Hassan11\nPeter Della Flora\nBashuan\nAllan McKay\nvalkq\nZwoa Meda Beda\nToma Marini\nCole Philips\n\n#d4a #porsche #sixstroke\n\n00:00 How it works\n08:34 Benefits\n14: 34 Drawbacks\n19:01 Why now?",

Click\nhttps://betterhelp.com/eamonandbec for a discount on your first month of therapy.\n\nSubscribe to Reroot our podcast channel to watch weekly chats between Eamon & Bec:\n@RerootwithEamonandBec \n\nWe're thrilled to be announcing season 3 of our podcast Reroot!!! Reroot is a safe space for us to have deep meaningful conversations between the two of us and with people who inspire us! Coming back to this project we knew we wanted to invest more energy into it so we needed to begin with a proper studio space for recording episodes and hosting guests. Today's video begins with a property hunt (we need approximately 750 sq-ft, great audio and natural light). We also want to be walking distance from home for ease and flexibility of life with our sweet baby girl Frankie. The second piece of the puzzle is that we want to be able to shoot content for Habit (our tea company) from this space. So, it needs to be big enough for our content creators to come in and have the room to create too!\nOnce we secure a location, we get to work learning how to set up a studio (something we know nothing about 😜 ).\n\nSpeaking of Habit, our fall teas are BACK and we've created a really special bundle when you buy all four. Check it out here: https://drinkhabit.com/\n\nRead below for a podcast description:\n\n🥰 We're ‪@eamonandbec‬ ! We’ve cultivated a community of 1M+ on YouTube, created Habit, and most importantly became new parents to Frankie Lee. Our lives have changed immensely in these past few years but through it all, our roots have deepened.\nWhile we've always shown up authentically online, there’s so much more of us that we want to share with our community. Reroot is a safe space where we explore the essence of who we are as individuals. As seekers of community, we hope this podcast continues to be an extension of our mission to foster open, healthy conversations.\n\nJoin the community 💛\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/rerootpod/\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@rerootpod\n\n\nIf you have questions about the brand relating to how the therapists are\ncredentialed, their privacy policy, or therapist compensation, here is an overview written by the YouTube creators behind the channel Cinema Therapy that goes into these topics:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cinema_therapy/comments/1dpriql/addressing_the_betterhelp_concerns_headon_deep/",

Click\nhttps://betterhelp.com/eamonandbec for a discount on your first month of therapy.\n\nSubscribe to Reroot our podcast channel to watch weekly chats between Eamon & Bec:\n@RerootwithEamonandBec \n\nWe're thrilled to be announcing season 3 of our podcast Reroot!!! Reroot is a safe space for us to have deep meaningful conversations between the two of us and with people who inspire us! Coming back to this project we knew we wanted to invest more energy into it so we needed to begin with a proper studio space for recording episodes and hosting guests. Today's video begins with a property hunt (we need approximately 750 sq-ft, great audio and natural light). We also want to be walking distance from home for ease and flexibility of life with our sweet baby girl Frankie. The second piece of the puzzle is that we want to be able to shoot content for Habit (our tea company) from this space. So, it needs to be big enough for our content creators to come in and have the room to create too!\nOnce we secure a location, we get to work learning how to set up a studio (something we know nothing about 😜 ).\n\nSpeaking of Habit, our fall teas are BACK and we've created a really special bundle when you buy all four. Check it out here: https://drinkhabit.com/\n\nRead below for a podcast description:\n\n🥰 We're ‪@eamonandbec‬ ! We’ve cultivated a community of 1M+ on YouTube, created Habit, and most importantly became new parents to Frankie Lee. Our lives have changed immensely in these past few years but through it all, our roots have deepened.\nWhile we've always shown up authentically online, there’s so much more of us that we want to share with our community. Reroot is a safe space where we explore the essence of who we are as individuals. As seekers of community, we hope this podcast continues to be an extension of our mission to foster open, healthy conversations.\n\nJoin the community 💛\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/rerootpod/\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@rerootpod\n\n\nIf you have questions about the brand relating to how the therapists are\ncredentialed, their privacy policy, or therapist compensation, here is an overview written by the YouTube creators behind the channel Cinema Therapy that goes into these topics:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cinema_therapy/comments/1dpriql/addressing_the_betterhelp_concerns_headon_deep/"

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 2 nights on Amtrak…\n2:03 Meet my mom :) \n3:03 Dramatic start\n7:35 day 2 9 hours in\n13:02 Tour of our tiny bunk room\n22:40 Fugitive onboard + police stop…\n29:30 day 3 - 31 hours in \n34:48 Neurologist/Epilepsy update\n37:49 bloops",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 2 nights on Amtrak…\n2:03 Meet my mom :) \n3:03 Dramatic start\n7:35 day 2 9 hours in\n13:02 Tour of our tiny bunk room\n22:40 Fugitive onboard + police stop…\n29:30 day 3 - 31 hours in \n34:48 Neurologist/Epilepsy update\n37:49 bloops"

From a custom-designed rock wall, individual bedrooms, and an exclusive puppy pool to a top-notch entertainment system and gourmet kitchen, this doggy haven sets a new standard in pet care. It's not just a dog house; it's a statement of the bond we share with our pets, blending comfort, luxury, and a dog's dream living space. But there's more! While we were immersed in this unique hotel construction, my sister got to know how adorable all of the humane society's dogs are. Wait until you see the grand reveal at the end of this journey, capturing the priceless moment the dogs set paws into their luxury mansion for the first time. For anyone who loves dogs, enjoys creative pet care content, and believes in pampering their furry friends, this video is a must-watch. This was tricky to make, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible!

It's not just a dog house; it's a statement of the bond we share with our pets, blending comfort, luxury, and a dog's dream living space. But there's more! While we were immersed in this unique hotel construction, my sister got to know how adorable all of the humane society's dogs are. Wait until you see the grand reveal at the end of this journey, capturing the priceless moment the dogs set paws into their luxury mansion for the first time.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard."

            "description": "Experience the shocking aftermath of Hurricane Helene as it unleashed a devastating 6-8 foot storm surge on John’s Pass. This video captures the sheer power of the storm as it ravaged this iconic Florida fishing village, leaving behind destruction in its wake. Watch as storm surge waters flood the streets, tearing apart docks, businesses, and boats. See firsthand the impact on local landmarks, with debris strewn everywhere and once-thriving shops and restaurants left in ruins. Witness the heart of John’s Pass under siege from nature’s fury, illustrating the community’s resilience in the face of one of the most powerful hurricanes to strike the area. Join us in this dramatic look at how Hurricane Helene transformed this beloved waterfront destination, reminding us of the incredible strength of coastal storms.",

ROBLOX DTI CODES\n\nIn this video, I will be showing you all of the newest Dress to Impress Codes for the NEWEST September 2024 Update in DTI! Be sure to leave a like and a subscribe if you enjoyed.\n\n⭐Discord Server:  https://discord.gg/ckXM3SDerp\n⭐Roblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/5177996/Blues-Squad#!/about\n⭐Roblox Profile: https://www.roblox.com/users/569518721/profile\n⭐Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blueqlow\n\n⭐ ROBLOX MERCH: \nShirts: https://www.roblox.com/catalog/18671742852/Blueqlow-250K-Merch\nPants: https://www.roblox.com/catalog/18774056302/Blueqlow-Pants\n\n➡️ Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6hQ9fEM9SvJiBHylJJcgnQ/join\n\nWhat is ROBLOX?\n\nROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, you to ­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\nAll of my videos follow YouTube's TOS.

ROBLOX DTI CODES\n\nIn this video, I will be showing you all of the newest Dress to Impress Codes for the NEWEST September 2024 Update in DTI!

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, you to ­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\nAll of my videos follow YouTube's TOS.

A massive success, it sold more than five million copies in the U.S., topped the album charts and produced four hit singles, including her signature anthem, \"Edge Of Seventeen.\" More platinum albums followed – ‘The Wild Heart’ (1983), ‘Rock A Little’ (1985), and ‘The Other Side Of The Mirror’ (1989).\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Stevie Nicks made history by becoming the first female artist inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice - first as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998, and most recently in recognition of an extraordinary solo career that spans nearly 40 years.\n\n#StevieNicks #TheLighthouse",

A massive success, it sold more than five million copies in the U.S., topped the album charts and produced four hit singles, including her signature anthem, \"Edge Of Seventeen.\" More platinum albums followed – ‘The Wild Heart’ (1983), ‘Rock A Little’ (1985), and ‘The Other Side Of The Mirror’ (1989).\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Stevie Nicks made history by becoming the first female artist inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice - first as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998, and most recently in recognition of an extraordinary solo career that spans nearly 40 years.\n\n#StevieNicks #TheLighthouse"
