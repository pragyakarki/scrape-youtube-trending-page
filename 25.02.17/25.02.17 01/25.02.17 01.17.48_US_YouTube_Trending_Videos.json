            "description": "Kylie’s back for a very special, supersized Valentine’s Day episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Cheerios and is joined by her first-ever male guest: her husband of seven years and Valentine: Jason Kelce. \n\nIn honor of this lovely occasion, we needed an entire hour to get to the bottom of who between Kylie and Jason is the LEAST romantic, where they actually went on their second official date and the hilarious moment that has Kylie crying laughing retelling the story.\n\nThe Kelces also talk about their “babymoon” in New Orleans, including the best foods they ate and that viral photo of Kylie housing a bag of cheetos in the suite during the Super Bowl.\n\nKylie and Jason then get honest about Valentine’s Day as a couple and as parents. They get into how they’ve celebrated in the past, their love languages and what traditions they now have with the girls.\n\nThen, in honor of their 7-ish years of marriage, Kylie and Jason answer 7-ish couples questions from the NGLers. They get into the best marriage advice they’ve ever received, the best gifts they’ve ever gotten each other, and whether or not they’d allow their daughters to date a football player when they’re older.\n\nAfter that, because no couples episode is complete without a game, Jason and Kylie play a game of “Pop Culture Trivia Off: The Battle For Who Knows the Least.” Kylie and Jason both admittedly don’t know much about current pop culture so they put their (lack of) knowledge to the test.\n\nMake sure you tune in to More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for a very special weird pregnancy cravings taste test!

                "description": "Kylie’s back for a very special, supersized Valentine’s Day episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Cheerios and is joined by her first-ever male guest: her husband of seven years and Valentine: Jason Kelce. \n\nIn honor of this lovely occasion, we needed an entire hour to get to the bottom of who between Kylie and Jason is the LEAST romantic, where they actually went on their second official date and the hilarious moment that has Kylie crying laughing retelling the story.\n\nThe Kelces also talk about their “babymoon” in New Orleans, including the best foods they ate and that viral photo of Kylie housing a bag of cheetos in the suite during the Super Bowl.\n\nKylie and Jason then get honest about Valentine’s Day as a couple and as parents. They get into how they’ve celebrated in the past, their love languages and what traditions they now have with the girls.\n\nThen, in honor of their 7-ish years of marriage, Kylie and Jason answer 7-ish couples questions from the NGLers. They get into the best marriage advice they’ve ever received, the best gifts they’ve ever gotten each other, and whether or not they’d allow their daughters to date a football player when they’re older.\n\nAfter that, because no couples episode is complete without a game, Jason and Kylie play a game of “Pop Culture Trivia Off: The Battle For Who Knows the Least.” Kylie and Jason both admittedly don’t know much about current pop culture so they put their (lack of) knowledge to the test.\n\nMake sure you tune in to More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for a very special weird pregnancy cravings taste test! Spoiler alert: someone nearly vomited during the recording of the segment! And of course, subscribe while you’re there so you don’t miss a thing.\n.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/not-gonna-lie-with-kylie-kelce/id1780888125\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0RgXbSGGmwpzAyeLHbDqUD?si=4585dab89c4f4c11&nd=1&dlsi=e178bf324b99403f\n\nFollow Not Gonna Lie on Social Media for all the best moments from the show: \nlnk.to/j61XD8\n\nSupport the Show:  \n\nCHEERIOS: Grab a box of heart shaped Cheerios in stores now!

I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. Peace!\n—\n\n🎬 *CREDITS:*\nDIRECTOR/HOST » Sonny Side\nDIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Trần Quang Đạo\nCAMERA OPERATOR » Đinh Tuấn Anh\nEPISODE EDITOR » Ngọc Lê Hồng\nCOLOR & MASTER » Quí Nguyễn\nON-GROUND PRODUCER » Terryh Nguyen\nCO-PRODUCER » Chantal Bieger\nCO-HOSTS » DaHong 大红 https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5e7fc5c600000000010034d6 | Bert https://www.instagram.com/foodxbert\n\nSelected tracks via Audio Network 🛆\n\n*Business Inquiries:*\n✉️ marketing@befrs.com"

            "description": "Family makes you. The game defines you. Here is the official trailer for Season 4 of Power Book III: Raising Kanan. Don’t miss the season premiere Friday, March 7 on the STARZ App.\n\n#PowerNeverEnds #STARZ\n\nSubscribe to the STARZ YouTube Channel for more Power: http://bit.ly/1kalhP0\n\nLike Raising Kanan on Facebook: https://bit.ly/3aCYxuE\nFollow Raising Kanan on Instagram: https://bit.ly/3vmiVrX\n\nFacebook: http://starz.tv/STARZFacebookYT\nInstagram: http://starz.tv/STARZInstagramYT\nYouTube: https://starz.tv/STARZYouTube\nTikTok: https://starz.tv/STARZTikTokYT\n\nOver the last two seasons of “Raising Kanan,” Kanan Stark has slowly learned the truth\nabout not only his mother, but also himself. It has been a tortuous journey for him and\neveryone around him. With each new revelation, Kanan has been forced to confront his\nfamily’s seemingly never-ending web of secrets and lies. He has spent much of this time\nin a state of denial, but now, Kanan’s blinders are finally off, and he doesn’t like what he\nsees. In season three, Kanan finds himself grappling with the very notions of right and\nwrong. Good and evil. Fidelity and disloyalty. And he’s not alone. Every member of the\nThomas family must confront an existential crisis that challenges their very identity.\nWhether it’s Marvin, who’s still trying to redeem himself, or Raq, who’s finally coming\nclean, or Lou, who’s wrestling with his own evil, or Jukebox, who’s simply trying to break\nfree from her family’s pathology, they are all attempting to redefine and reinvent themselves. They won’t all be able to complete this intensely personal quest, but for those who do, the destination may reveal the most terrifying secret of all. There is no right and wrong or good and evil. There are no absolutes. In the end, there’s just you.",

                "description": "Family makes you. The game defines you. Here is the official trailer for Season 4 of Power Book III: Raising Kanan. Don’t miss the season premiere Friday, March 7 on the STARZ App.\n\n#PowerNeverEnds #STARZ\n\nSubscribe to the STARZ YouTube Channel for more Power: http://bit.ly/1kalhP0\n\nLike Raising Kanan on Facebook: https://bit.ly/3aCYxuE\nFollow Raising Kanan on Instagram: https://bit.ly/3vmiVrX\n\nFacebook: http://starz.tv/STARZFacebookYT\nInstagram: http://starz.tv/STARZInstagramYT\nYouTube: https://starz.tv/STARZYouTube\nTikTok: https://starz.tv/STARZTikTokYT\n\nOver the last two seasons of “Raising Kanan,” Kanan Stark has slowly learned the truth\nabout not only his mother, but also himself. It has been a tortuous journey for him and\neveryone around him. With each new revelation, Kanan has been forced to confront his\nfamily’s seemingly never-ending web of secrets and lies. He has spent much of this time\nin a state of denial, but now, Kanan’s blinders are finally off, and he doesn’t like what he\nsees. In season three, Kanan finds himself grappling with the very notions of right and\nwrong. Good and evil. Fidelity and disloyalty. And he’s not alone. Every member of the\nThomas family must confront an existential crisis that challenges their very identity.\nWhether it’s Marvin, who’s still trying to redeem himself, or Raq, who’s finally coming\nclean, or Lou, who’s wrestling with his own evil, or Jukebox, who’s simply trying to break\nfree from her family’s pathology, they are all attempting to redefine and reinvent themselves. They won’t all be able to complete this intensely personal quest, but for those who do, the destination may reveal the most terrifying secret of all. There is no right and wrong or good and evil. There are no absolutes. In the end, there’s just you."

Kecerdasannya dan selera humornya yang datar menarik bagi anak-anak dan orang dewasa. Sebagai produk generasi milenial, apresiasinya terhadap teknologi baru berpadu dengan etos kerja kuno, dan ia menawarkan kemampuan unik untuk menyampaikan pesannya dengan cara yang sesuai dengan petani seumur hidup maupun mereka yang tidak memiliki pengetahuan tentang pertanian. Dengan meningkatnya kesadaran konsumen tentang asal makanan mereka, Zach telah mengidentifikasi perlunya suara independen dari garis depan pertanian. Zach secara aktif mempromosikan pertanian dengan berbagi pengalaman sehari-harinya di dunia pertanian sambil memberikan pendidikan dari petani ke petani untuk membantu memfasilitasi percakapan kolaboratif antara petani dan masyarakat. \nIkuti \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nDiedit Oleh: Becky Johnson"

Generation, der sein Leben damit verbracht hat, auf dem Bauernhof seiner Familie anzubauen, zu arbeiten und zu lernen. Sein Witz und sein trockener Sinn für Humor sprechen Kinder und Erwachsene gleichermaßen an. Als Produkt der Millennial-Generation verbindet sich seine Wertschätzung für neue Technologien mit seiner altmodischen Arbeitsmoral und er verfügt über die einzigartige Fähigkeit, seine Botschaft auf eine Weise zu vermitteln, die sowohl bei langjährigen Landwirten als auch bei jenen Anklang findet, die keine Ahnung von Landwirtschaft haben. Angesichts des wachsenden Bewusstseins der Verbraucher darüber, woher ihre Lebensmittel kommen, hat Zach erkannt, dass eine unabhängige Stimme aus der Landwirtschaftsbranche erforderlich ist. Zach fördert aktiv die Landwirtschaft, indem er seine täglichen Erfahrungen in der Landwirtschaftswelt teilt und gleichzeitig Landwirt für Landwirt Bildung vermittelt, um einen gemeinsamen Dialog zwischen Landwirten und der Öffentlichkeit zu ermöglichen. \nFolgen Sie uns \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nBearbeitet von: Becky Johnson"

This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

At Aunty Donna, we believe that's lots too many. That's why we're committed to raising awareness for footwear related sketch comedy injuries. We have not donated any money to this cause. And we ask that you too do not give generously to this cause. Instead, help us raise awareness by sharing this video and using the hashtag #maintainasafeperimeteraroundshoesonthefloor. Together, we can end *footwear related sketch comedy injuries.\n\n*Footwear related sketch comedy injuries refers to trips, falls, spills, wobbles, and tumbles. Footwear related sketch comedy injuries occurring as a result of ill-fitting footwear such as blisters are excluded.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE AUNTY DONNA CHANNEL: http://bit.ly/ADYTSubscribe\nJOIN OUR PATREON: https://bit.ly/AuntyDonnaClub\nBUY MERCH: https://bit.ly/AuntyDonnaMerch\nWATCH AUNTY DONNA'S COFFEE CAFE: bit.ly/watchcoffeecafe\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@auntydonna\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/theauntydonnagallery/\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/TheAuntyDonna\nX: https://twitter.com/AuntyDonnaBoys\nSPOTIFY: http://bit.ly/AuntyDonnaBoys\nAUNTY DONNA PODCAST: everywhere you listen to pods\n\n#comedy #sketchcomedy #auntydonna",

Watch the Jurassic World Rebirth trailer now. \n\n-----\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@jurassicworld\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jurassicworld\nX: https://twitter.com/jurassicworld\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jurassicworld\nOfficial Site: https://www.jurassicworld.com/\n\nA new era is born. This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",
