            "description": "When you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you. Joker: Folie À Deux – only in theaters and IMAX, October 4. #JokerMovie #FilmedForIMAX \n\nFrom acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes “Joker: Folie À Deux,” the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Academy Award-winning “Joker,” which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.  The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar winner Lady Gaga (“A Star Is Born”).\n\n“Joker: Folie À Deux” finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (“The Banshees of Inisherin”) and Catherine Keener (“Get Out,” “Capote”), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from “Joker.”\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing “Joker,” directed “Joker: Folie À Deux” from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC.  The film was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner.  Lady Gaga served as music consultant.  The film’s executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg and Jason Ruder.\n\nWorking with Phillips behind the camera are his team from “Joker,” including Oscar-nominated director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberg, Oscar-nominated editor Jeff Groth, and composer Hildur Guđnadóttir, who won the Oscar for her work on the first film.  New to the team is Oscar-nominated costume designer Arianne Phillips (“Once Upon a Time in… Hollywood,” “Don’t Worry Darling”).  Ruder is the film’s executive music producer and the music supervisors are Randall Poster and George Drakoulias.  Casting is by Francine Maisler (the “Dune” films, “Challengers”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents A Joint Effort Production, A Film by Todd Phillips, “Joker: Folie À Deux.”  The film will be released worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, and will be only in theaters nationwide on October 4, 2024, and beginning internationally on 2 October, 2024.",

У каждого из них своя причина охотиться на мерзких тварей, которые теперь населяют нефтяные поля и заброшенные шахты.\n\nНекогда здесь была зеленая местность с лесами и скалистыми утесами, но теперь Распадок Маммоны куда более похож на своих обитателей — зловещих и гнилых.

Tengo una historia de construcción de los mejores proyectos de Bob Esponja en YouTube, incluyendo cuando construí la casa de Bob Esponja en mi patio trasero, cuando construí Fondo de Bikini en mi patio trasero, cuando construí el vagón de Bob Esponja Patty, cuando construí el cubo de Bob Esponja Chum y cuando mis amigos y yo sobrevivimos 24 horas en Fondo de Bikini.  Así que me emocioné muchísimo cuando Nickelodeon me pidió que construyera la estatua de Bob Esponja más grande del mundo para celebrar el 25 aniversario de Bob Esponja en los Kid's Choice Awards. Esta construcción ha sido una de las más difíciles que he hecho, pero no podría estar más contento con el resultado. A todos los asistentes a los Kid's Choice Awards les encantó.Esta construcción ha sido una de las más difíciles que he hecho, pero no podría estar más contento con el resultado. A todos los asistentes a los Kid's Choice Awards les encantó. Incluso pude cumplir mi sueño de conocer a los actores de doblaje de Bob Esponja y Arenita, Tom Kenny y Carolyn Lawrence.

If you dig this please give it a share!\n\nNEW Return to Life Apparel is available at: \nhttps://www.returntolife.store\n\n♥ ECREW\nWhat is Ecrew? When I had to uproot and move to Indiana, there was a car community called Bcrew (B for Bloomington, Indiana). These guys became my family. Instead of partying on the weekends, I was working on cars- and I loved it. Since starting youtube, I have started what I call Ecrew. It's a community where you get to take 10min out of your day and be involved in a build, but more importantly it's a family.\n\nMake sure to subscribe: http://bit.ly/subscribe2Emelia​​\n\nADD ME ON:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ms.emelia/​​\nTikTok: https://https://www.tiktok.com/uqxsBR/​​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/emeliahartford​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/emeliahartfo...\nWebsite: https://emeliahartford.com/​​\n\nWatch my last videos:\n\nDriving Stradman's $1.2M Bugatti Veyron (Sorry about your car)\nhttps://youtu.be/GqwoHSjl8GY\n\nDelivering my Widebody Ferrari 458 to Stradman\nhttps://youtu.be/X0EMkT0d4fo\n\nIntroducing my AWD Widebody \"Supercar Killer\" DAILY DRIVER\nhttps://youtu.be/tv0gv_2on40\n\nThe New 2023 Corvette Z06 RIPS!

After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River.  Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened.  With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice's name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.\n\nBurton, a genre unto himself, directs from a screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (Wednesday), story by Gough & Millar and Seth Grahame-Smith (The LEGO® Batman Movie), based on characters created by Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson.

Earlier this year, he re-released his album 3.15.20 under the name Atavista, and soon he'll be dropping his final studio album under the Childish Gambino name. It's called Bando Stone & The New World, which will be accompanied by a short film and world tour. But how is he with spicy food?
