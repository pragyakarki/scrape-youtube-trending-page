            "description": "We're feeling pretty confident that a winter #storm is on its way, and it’s likely to have quite an effect on travel in Texas starting Wednesday afternoon in the west. It will gradually move east on Thursday, affecting the northern half to two-thirds of our lovely state. We can expect some #snow and ice accumulations, with a growing chance of significant snow (over 4 inches!) in areas like the Permian Basin, Big Country, Concho Valley, and parts of North Texas. Depending on how this system unfolds, we might see the precipitation wrap up by late Thursday or sometime Friday morning in eastern Texas.

            "description": "A major pattern shift is unfolding across the United States as we track multiple significant weather systems. An intense Arctic blast continues to grip much of the country, bringing temperatures 10-20 degrees below normal and dangerous wind chills. Lake effect snow will intensify periodically with these repeated cold surges.\nA complex storm system is developing in the Gulf, which could bring widespread heavy precipitation and even the potential for ice in unusual locations. This system's evolution remains highly uncertain, with models showing various scenarios for its track and intensity. The timing and placement of this low pressure system will be crucial for determining impacts along the East Coast.\nMeanwhile, the Western U.S. will see a breakdown of its warmer pattern as a frontal system approaches the coast. This changing pattern could lead to more widespread precipitation from the Northwest to the Rockies.\nStay tuned for updates as we continue to track these developing systems.

            "description": "The sixth flight test of Starship launched from Starbase on November 19, 2024, seeking to expand the envelope on ship and booster capabilities and get closer to bringing reuse of the entire system online.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster successfully lifted off at the start of the launch window, with all 33 Raptor engines powering it and Starship off the pad from Starbase. Following a nominal ascent and stage separation, the booster successfully transitioned to its boostback burn to begin the return to launch site. During this phase, automated health checks of critical hardware on the launch and catch tower triggered an abort of the catch attempt. The booster then executed a pre-planned divert maneuver, performing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nStarship completed another successful ascent, placing it on the expected trajectory. The ship successfully reignited a single Raptor engine while in space, demonstrating the capabilities required to conduct a ship deorbit burn before starting fully orbital missions. With live views and telemetry being relayed by Starlink, the ship successfully made it through reentry and executed a flip, landing burn, and soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nData gathered from the multiple thermal protection experiments, as well as the successful flight through subsonic speeds at a more aggressive angle of attack, provides invaluable feedback on flight hardware performing in a flight environment as we aim for eventual ship return and catch.\n\nWith data and flight learnings as our primary payload, Starship’s sixth flight test once again delivered. Lessons learned will directly make the entire Starship system more reliable as we close in on full and rapid reusability.",

This session is a soft hand reaching out to help you befriend you. Prana as a series is about aligning with the wisdom of your body and being. On Day 1 you will get a taste for holistic yoga practice that takes a therapeutic approach to physical strength, joint health, nervous system resilience, and your mental wellness. Our primary focus is on the breath. \n\nDay 1 practice time, 27 minutes. This is the longest session in the series. Slow down and use it to check in with your body, your breathing patterns, and your whole self fully. This practice sets you up so nicely for the rest of the series! It’s soft, it’s inquisitive, it has foundations for subtle body awareness as well as gross body work.  Day 1 asks you to be curious about what it feels like to move in this current season of your life. \n\nTap in. Listen. Let’s get your energy moving. \n\nThank you for showing up for yourself.

This session is a soft hand reaching out to help you befriend you. Prana as a series is about aligning with the wisdom of your body and being. On Day 1 you will get a taste for holistic yoga practice that takes a therapeutic approach to physical strength, joint health, nervous system resilience, and your mental wellness. Our primary focus is on the breath. \n\nDay 1 practice time, 27 minutes. This is the longest session in the series. Slow down and use it to check in with your body, your breathing patterns, and your whole self fully. This practice sets you up so nicely for the rest of the series! It’s soft, it’s inquisitive, it has foundations for subtle body awareness as well as gross body work.  Day 1 asks you to be curious about what it feels like to move in this current season of your life. \n\nTap in. Listen. Let’s get your energy moving. \n\nThank you for showing up for yourself.

Y bienvenidos a (espero) una nueva serie de vídeos... Algunos de vosotros ya sabéis que somos grandes fans del contenido de viajes en este canal, pero no del jet lag. Así que, cuando estuvimos en Singapur este verano, pensamos: ¿por qué no intentar adoptar un horario de sueño invertido y, en lugar de sentarnos en nuestra habitación de hotel en el Marina Bay Sands, por qué no salir a la ciudad y echar un vistazo a los mejores restaurantes nocturnos, tiendas, spas (¿y... camarones?) que Singapur tiene para ofrecer, a todas horas de la noche? Quédate con nosotros mientras exploramos una tienda departamental de 6 pisos que abre hasta tarde durante varias horas, intentamos embellecer Hot Pot y pescamos camarones en un centro comercial vacío a las 4 a. m. Un vlog de viajes para todos los búhos nocturnos dementes 🫡\n\nCuéntanos si te gusta esta serie y podemos intentar hacer más en viajes futuros. Definitivamente visitaremos Tokio esta primavera, pero si hay otra ciudad que te entusiasmaría ver, ¡cuéntanoslo! \n\n¡Echa un vistazo a nuestra tienda de productos aquí! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMi Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMi TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nEl canal de Tyler: https://www.youtube.com/@tylerwilliams\nNuestro canal de YouTube Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/@safiyashorts\n\nMÚSICA\nA través de AudioNetwork\n\nProductores ejecutivos: Safiya Nygaard y Tyler Williams\nProductora ejecutiva: Lona Smith\nProductora asociada: Ishara Mathews\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditora: Mandy Padgett\nEditora: Leslie Alcantar\nDiseñadora gráfica: Dayana Espinoza"

From what I saw, the coffee cherry itself didn't look very special, and in my opinion, it didn't justify the unique smell and flavor of coffee.\n\nSo, to figure things out for myself, I decided to make coffee from scratch. However, what I didn't know, was just how hard it could be to make.\n\nNileBrew Shirt: https://nilered.tv/nilebrew\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMerch - https://nilered.tv/store\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n■ My main channel NileRed: https://www.youtube.com/c/nilered\n\n■ NileBlue is now available alongside NileRed on Nebula!  https://go.nebula.tv/nilered\n(when signing up with this link, a portion of your membership directly supports the channel)\n\nJoin the community:\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/nilered\nDiscord - https://discord.com/invite/3BT6UHf\nNileRed Newsletter - https://nile.red/home#newsletter\n\nYou can also find me here:\nFacebook - https://m.facebook.com/NileRed2\nInstagram - https://m.instagram.com/nile.red\nTwitter - https://mobile.twitter.com/NileRed2\n\nNile talks about lab safety: https://youtu.be/ftACSEJ6DZA"

            "description": "Ashley Pointer | December 20, 2024\nWhen I greeted Sabrina Carpenter at NPR HQ for her Tiny Desk debut, her charm was immediately disarming. Bubbling with excitement, she extended her hand, introduced herself and complimented my outfit with genuine warmth. You’d think this was one of her first “big time” gigs, not a regular performance for a pop veteran, having sold out arenas across the country touring her now six time Grammy-nominated sixth album, Short n’ Sweet. That humility made me love her even more. \n\nBut Carpenter delivers far more than just charm in this performance. Backed by her band, complimented with pedal steel and a string quartet, she reimagines her biggest hits from Short n’ Sweet, while sharing the stories in between songs of how these tracks came to life. Opening with “Taste,” strings serve up some playful pizzicato, before Carpenter and her band move into a lush, soulful version “Bed Chem.” Then everyone swaps their electric instruments for acoustic to perform “Please Please Please” and “Slim Pickins.” Finally, Carpenter closes with the viral favorite “Juno,” cheekily asking the audience, “Have you ever tried this one?” before sweeping her rear end across the windchimes, earning a laugh from the room. \n\n“When I first started [writing songs] it was kinda in a room like this — a room with very dry walls and there’s no reverb,” Carpenter reflects at the top of her performance. “But there’s something so real and special.” That authenticity set the tone for a memorable session with one of 2024’s biggest breakout superstars.\n\nSET LIST\n“Taste”\n“Bed Chem”\n“Please Please Please”\n“Slim Pickins”\n“Espresso”\n“Juno”\n\nMUSICIANS\nSabrina Carpenter: vocals\nHaeun “hani” You: piano, keyboards\nCaleb Nelson: guitar\nMatt Park: pedal steel guitar\nChris Johnson: drums\nAlexandra Simpson: viola\nSarena Hsu: violin\nYasmeen “YAS” Al-Mazeedi: violin\nBobby Wooten III: bass\nMarza Merophi Wilks: cello\nChristine Noel Smit: background vocals\nMIA MOR: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Ashley Pointer, Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel, Wendy Li\nAudio Engineer: David Greenburg\nProduction Assistant: Elle Mannion\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #sabrinacarpenter #espresso #nprmusic \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Better Help, committed to helping clients with issues ranging from relationship challenges and goal-setting to grief and depression.
