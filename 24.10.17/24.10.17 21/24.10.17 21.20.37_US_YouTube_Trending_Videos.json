If a Sim dies with Unfinished Business they can still live(?) their dreams as a Ghost, and still earn rewards. The ultimate reward for completing Bucket Lists and Unfinished Business is Rebirth.\n\nFor Sims who want to live life on the dark side there are two new careers; an off-screen Mortician career and an active Reaper career which will let you go work for Grim at his secret office as well as travel to reap souls.\n\nThere's a lot of eerie fun to get into off the clock as well. Explore Crypts, build your Thanatlogy skill, collect tarot cards, and even adopt a Pet Crow.\n\nDeath affects different Sims in different ways. Create fully custom Grieving Rituals and decorate Caskets and Gravesites according to the wishes of the departed Sim or their loved ones. There are 4 types of grief which Sims may experience depending on their personalities and their relationship to the deceased.\n\nSims can also prepare for their own deaths in life by creating Wills and deciding who to pass on Heirlooms, assets, and children should they pass away.\n\nThe journey doesn't end with death. Sims can continue on as Ghosts and even learn new supernatural powers. Ghosts who are helpful while haunting will earn Goodwill essence while Ghosts who think it's fun to be frightening will earn Fear essence. Both essences can be sold for Simoleans.\n\nEmbrace the Macabre (one of 3 new traits!) in Life & Death.\n\nAvailable October 31 at 10AM PT on EA App PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation®4, and PlayStation®5.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #jd",

            "description": "It is with broken hearts we share the untimely passing of our hero, Justin Bingham. The world lost a legend. His family lost their rock. Lindsay lost the love of her life. Their children have lost their best friend. But we have not lost hope. Justin loved life more than anything. His passion for living was rivaled only by his devotion to his family. His wife and his four precious kids were his reason for living, the reason he got out of bed every morning and his sole purpose on earth.\n\nHe never would have wanted to leave them this way but we pray that he can see the armies of earthly angels surrounding his family at this most desolate time. There are no words to describe the pain or confusion we are all feeling right now, but if you knew Justin you know he would infuse this moment with optimism and positivity. He’d grab this agony by the horns and ride it through the impending storm with his family on his back. So we pick up the pieces. We remember him. We honor him. We lean on his strength. And we find a way. We move forward with faith, however impossible it may seem, and look forward to the day we are together again.\n\nWe are eternally grateful for the outpouring of love and support the family has already received. For those who wish to pay their respects and anyone looking to be inspired by his exemplary life you can find more information on his obituary page: https://www.andersonmortuary.com/obituaries/justin-bingham\n\nThank you.

Sí,\nEso es para usarlo y\n\nMi cuerpo está diciendo…\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien\nEstoy suelta y ahora\nPuedo hacer lo que quiera \nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nAun huele a verano aquí\n¿Qué tiene de malo? Sí\nEso es para usarlo y\n\nMi cuerpo está diciendo…\n\nAun huele a verano aquí\nY eso es para usarlo, si\nHoy algo me gano aquí, \n \nAy, \n\nAhh, se pasa rico soltera \nY ahora las lobas…\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien\nEstoy suelta y ahora\nPuedo hacer lo que quiera \nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nAy que rico…mira que rico\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien \nPa’ que ese cabrón \nCuando me vea le duela\nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien \nPa’ que ese cabrón \nCuando me vea le duela\nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nShakira: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/shakira\nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@shakira\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/shakira\n\n#Shakira #Soltera\n\nOfficial Video by Shakira performing Soltera.

Sí,\nEso es para usarlo y\n\nMi cuerpo está diciendo…\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien\nEstoy suelta y ahora\nPuedo hacer lo que quiera \nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nAun huele a verano aquí\n¿Qué tiene de malo? Sí\nEso es para usarlo y\n\nMi cuerpo está diciendo…\n\nAun huele a verano aquí\nY eso es para usarlo, si\nHoy algo me gano aquí, \n \nAy, \n\nAhh, se pasa rico soltera \nY ahora las lobas…\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien\nEstoy suelta y ahora\nPuedo hacer lo que quiera \nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nAy que rico…mira que rico\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien \nPa’ que ese cabrón \nCuando me vea le duela\nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nYo tengo derecho de portarme mal \nPa’ pasarla bien \nPa’ que ese cabrón \nCuando me vea le duela\nSe pasa rico soltera\n\nShakira: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/shakira\nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@shakira\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/shakira\n\n#Shakira #Soltera\n\nOfficial Video by Shakira performing Soltera.

This is part of a continuing exploration of how copper and magnets behave together.\n\nPlease consider supporting me on Patreon. https://www.patreon.com/user?u=58360840 You'll receive access to Patreon only posts as well as any 3d printing files that I designed. \n\nCasting equipment\nPetroBond https://amzn.to/4bZJqsJ\nCrucible salamander https://amzn.to/4eo1vSW\nCrucible lifting Tongs https://amzn.to/3Vtc26G\nHigh heat Gloves https://amzn.to/3XqPiai\nLeather Jacket https://amzn.to/4chpUaU\nBoot Covers https://amzn.to/4aZ1G4o\nBoots https://amzn.to/3XpFmxz\nCasting Flasks https://amzn.to/3Rtj4XT\nGraphite Molds https://amzn.to/3VkiIUK\nBlow torch https://amzn.to/3z3Rkms\nRespirator https://amzn.to/3zbFUNq\nFace shield https://amzn.to/4b47XM3\nToAuto Furnace https://amzn.to/4epMeRz\nPropane Furnace https://amzn.to/3yVQIz9\n\n3d printing FDM \nFilament https://amzn.to/4coyVPQ\n3d printer Ender https://amzn.to/3L58YsZ\n\n3d printing Resin\nSiraya tech castable resin https://amzn.to/4b95n7w\nElegoo resin https://amzn.to/3XrASGY\nResin Printer Mars 4 https://amzn.to/3RsL6mw\n\nBelt Grinder \nGrinding Belts https://amzn.to/3RsTySM\nSurface conditioning belts  https://amzn.to/4eicD41\nTrizact belts https://amzn.to/3RuW0bg\n\nBelt Grinder Accessories \nGrinding Belts https://amzn.to/3RsTySM\nSurface conditioning belts https://amzn.to/4eicD41\nTrizact belts https://amzn.to/3RuW0bg\n6” grinding wheel https://amzn.to/4b3NF5h\n\nWelding\nKidskin welding gloves https://amzn.to/3VstSXu\nPrime Weld machine https://amzn.to/3KMeXCQ\n\nMetal finishing tools \nNevrdull https://amzn.to/3XwyVsu\nLiver of Sulfur https://amzn.to/3XkFCOs\nProtectaclear Clear Coat https://amzn.to/3XrBjkA\nScotch-brite Wheels https://amzn.to/3KI6v7B\nMetal Files High Quality https://amzn.to/4eifrOB\nDie grinder discs Benchmark abrasives https://amzn.to/4esof4v\nDremel - rubber polishing bits https://amzn.to/3KKvAi5\nDremel - Wire brushes https://amzn.to/3yYtQiu\nSimichrome Polishing Compound https://amzn.to/3xapnZM\n\nGeneral \nWilton bullet bench vice https://amzn.to/4ckifIV\nBandsaw blades https://amzn.to/3XkmGPT\nJB weld https://amzn.to/3xapGno\nSuper Glue https://amzn.to/3VISP2i\nShop Lights https://amzn.to/3xmMVur\nLoc-line shield https://amzn.to/45v7Nfx\nSmoke purifier https://amzn.to/3XoCMI4\n\nSome of my favorite tools of the year\nMakita Blower https://amzn.to/4c43LNK\nMini circular saw https://amzn.to/3VnWykp\nMakita blower small https://amzn.to/4eCxFKT\nRatcheting screwdriver https://amzn.to/3KQUc8J\nGerman pliers https://amzn.to/3xiRKou\nDremel cordless https://amzn.to/45ofDrt\n\nCamera Equipment\nCanon 6d II https://amzn.to/4erxUbi\nLights https://amzn.to/3xjzMSK\nRode Mic  https://amzn.to/3XkFkHm\nCanon 50mm stm https://amzn.to/3VJ3EBu\nCanon 24-70 f2.8 https://amzn.to/3z340dn\n\nAll of the links above are affiliate links.
