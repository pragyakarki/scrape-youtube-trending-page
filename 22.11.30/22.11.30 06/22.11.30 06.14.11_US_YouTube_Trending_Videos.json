            "description": "Portugal and Uruguay faced off in their second matches of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In the first half both teams struggled to score. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo was itching to get the ball in the net. In the 54th minute in the second half, a goal was credited to him at first. Later in the match, the credit was given to Bruno Fernandes. Uruguay tried relentlessly to equalize the score but failed. Bruno Fernandes would add another goal, via penalty kick, in stoppage time. Portugal won 2-0, marking the first time since 2006 that they have won consecutive matches in the World Cup.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Portugal #Uruguay\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

                "description": "Portugal and Uruguay faced off in their second matches of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In the first half both teams struggled to score. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo was itching to get the ball in the net. In the 54th minute in the second half, a goal was credited to him at first. Later in the match, the credit was given to Bruno Fernandes. Uruguay tried relentlessly to equalize the score but failed. Bruno Fernandes would add another goal, via penalty kick, in stoppage time. Portugal won 2-0, marking the first time since 2006 that they have won consecutive matches in the World Cup.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Portugal #Uruguay\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

The film is directed by Matt Danner, the writers are Ray DeLaurentis & Will Schifrin, the producer is Shawn Levy, and the executive producers are Emily Morris, Chris Columbus, Mark Radcliffe, and Michael Barnathan, with music by John Paesano. The Original Movie is about the mischief that takes place every night at the American Museum of Natural History when the sun goes down. Nick Daley’s summer gig as night watchman at the museum is a challenging job for a high school student, but he is following in his father’s footsteps and is determined not to let him down. Luckily, he is familiar with the museum’s ancient tablet that brings everything to life when the sun goes down and is happy to see his old friends, including Jedediah, Octavius, and Sacagawea, when he arrives. But when the maniacal ruler Kahmunrah escapes with plans to unlock the Egyptian underworld and free its Army of the Dead, it is up to Nick to stop the demented overlord and save the museum once and for all.",

After half, Ecuador would respond in the 67th minute thanks to Moises Caicedo, only for Senegal to regain the lead minutes later thanks to Kalidou Koulibaly.

                "description": "Ecuador and Senegal faced off in their third matches of the 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage. In the first half both teams struggled to score. Moises Caicedo went down with an injury in the 37th minute, but managed to come back onto the field. Ismaila Sarr was awarded a penalty kick and scored to give Senegal a 1-0 lead in the 44th minute. After half, Ecuador would respond in the 67th minute thanks to Moises Caicedo, only for Senegal to regain the lead minutes later thanks to Kalidou Koulibaly. Senegal reaches the knockout stage for the first time since 2002.\n\n#FOXSoccer #WorldCup #Ecuador #Senegal\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

            "description": "P1Harmony (피원하모니) 5th Mini Album [HARMONY : SET IN]\n'Back Down' MV\n\n조화를 이루기 위한 방법은 다양하다. 진정한 조화의 시작은 서로 갈등을 겪어도, 더 완벽한 세상을 위해 모두 함께 한 단계 위로 나아가는 것. P1Harmony(피원하모니)는 다섯 번째 미니 앨범 ‘HARMONY : SET IN’을 통해 각자 다른 가치관 속에서 온전히 하나가 되기 위한 진정한 조화의 발걸음을 내디딘다.\n\n미니 5집 타이틀곡 ‘Back Down’은 언제 어디서든 겁내어 물러서지 말고 함께 헤쳐 나가자는 단합과 전진의 메시지를 담고 있다. ‘이겨 낼 수 있어 Together / Back Down, 절대 Don’t worry’ 등 완전한 조화의 모습을 향해 노력하고자 하는 피원하모니의 의지를 보여준다.\n\n타이틀곡 ‘Back Down’ 외에도 P1Harmony의 에너지와 포부를 보여주는 수록곡들이 담겼다. 친한 친구들과 함께 신나게 즐기자는 팝 댄스곡 ‘BFF (Best Friends Forever)’, 세상을 놀래고자 하는 멤버들의 자신감이 돋보이는 ‘Secret Sauce’, 나만의 색을 보여주자는 다짐이 담긴 힙합곡 ‘One And Only’, 우리는 결국 목표를 이루어 낼 것이라는 가사가 인상적인 ‘태양을 삼킨 아이 (Look At Me Now)’, 멤버 지웅이 작사·작곡에 참여한 미디엄 팝 발라드곡 ‘배낭여행 (Better Together)’까지 총 여섯 곡이 수록됐다. 특히 멤버 인탁, 종섭은 새 앨범 전곡 작사에 참여하며 P1Harmony의 이야기를 직접 꾸려냈다.  \n\n서로를 향한 믿음과 우정으로 단합한 피원하모니. 그들이 꿈꾸는 더 나은 세상은 결국 눈 앞에 펼쳐질지, 완벽한 하모니를 향한 출발점인 ‘HARMONY PROTOCOL’만이 그 답을 알고 있다.\n\nThere are various ways to achieve harmony. The beginning of true harmony is to move altogether to a next level for a more perfect world, even if there are conflicts. Through the 5th Mini Album ‘HARMONY : SET IN’, P1Harmony takes a step of true harmony to become completely one in different values.\n\nThe title song of the 5th Mini Album, ‘Back Down’, contains a message of unity and moving forward to get through together without backing down from the fear at anytime and anywhere. It shows P1Harmony’s will to strive toward complete harmony through ‘We can get through Together / Back Down, Never Don’t worry’.\n\nIn addition to the title song ‘Back Down’, the album contains B-side songs that show P1Harmony's energy and ambition. Total of 6 songs are included in this album: the pop dance song ‘BFF (Best Friends Forever)’ to enjoy with the best friends, ‘Secret Sauce’ showing the members’ confidence to surprise the world, ‘One And Only’, a hip-hop song with a determination to show one’s own color, ‘태양을 삼킨 아이 (Look At Me Now)’, with impressive lyrics that says we will eventually achieve our goal, and ‘배낭여행 (Better Together)’ a medium pop ballad song in which member JIUNG participated in penning the lyrics and composing the song. In particular, members INTAK and JONGSEOB participated in penning the lyrics of all songs in this new album and created the story of P1Harmony themselves.\n\nP1Harmony, united by faith and friendship toward each other. Only ‘HARMONY PROTOCOL’, the starting point for perfect harmony, knows the answer to whether the better world they dream of will eventually unfold in front of them.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony \n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony \n▷OFFICIAL TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_official \n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS TWITTER : https://twitter.com/P1H_members \n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official \n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony \n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #5th_Mini_Album #HARMONY #SETIN #Back_Down",

Tyler gets flashy and brings a Ferrari 458 Spider that's missing a few things, Ed chooses a nearly perfect Audi R8 V10+ & tries not to fall asleep, & Freddy brings his SEMA show car McLaren 675LT, which may end up being too expensive and too fast for these challenges. They are then shown to Car Wizard for inspection before proving themselves on a real, actual track. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow @reecegold3 on Instagram! \nFight your ticket with The Ticket Clinic!►https://vinwiki.com/r/tc\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n#CarTrek9 #FoundOnAutoTempest #WreckedExotics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAR TREK SERIES 7 PLAYLIST\nSeries 7, Episode 1►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL7TDaOGDAo\nSeries 7, Episode 2►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoC2qH6m3bg\nSeries 7, Episode 3►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96BqVVCpztI\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAR TREK SERIES 6 PLAYLIST\nSeries 6, Episode 1►https://youtu.be/TrTZgv3s4A0\nSeries 6, Episode 2►https://youtu.be/hppd9apHqfM\nSeries 6, Episode 3►https://youtu.be/7dVVbyTurt8\nSeries 6, Episode 4►https://youtu.be/Suhj7SJuEbM\nSeries 6, Episode 5►https://youtu.be/x6MmTpDTkkY\nSeries 6, Episode 6(FINALE)►https://youtu.be/keCS8QZyHsA\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n#StarTrek #FoundOnAutoTempest #GasGuzzlers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 5 PLAYLIST \nSeries 5, Episode 1►https://youtu.be/9-SrII9jMsA\nSeries 5, Episode 2►https://youtu.be/ETmh0sb0jaI\nSeries 5, Episode 3►https://youtu.be/M1SpwlsaiwM\nSeries 5, Episode 4►https://youtu.be/-2_zzwi3Q2Y\nSeries 5, Episode 5►https://youtu.be/4NJ7AxkUjW4\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 4 PLAYLIST\nSeries 4, Episode 1►https://youtu.be/NmwIdGUb3qY\nSeries 4, Episode 2►https://youtu.be/HJZVyoWS9fU\nSeries 4, Episode 3►https://youtu.be/BR51TbFVJZQ\nSeries 4, Episode 4 ►https://youtu.be/I2ySIkH62bw\nSeries 4, Episode 5(FINALE)►https://youtu.be/AQj3Nw1W3_k\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 3 PLAYLIST\nSeries 3, Episode 1►https://youtu.be/TN6E1gyb4qQ\nSeries 3, Episode 2►https://youtu.be/h_YaBjx4P2Q\nSeries 3, Episode 3 ►https://youtu.be/zQbERnh3atc\nSeries 3, Episode 4 ►https://youtu.be/zxP6fYvXR_o\nSeries 3, Episode 5(FINALE)►https://youtu.be/tmymr12wc84\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 2 PLAYLIST:\nSeries 2, Episode 1 ►https://youtu.be/bDAiui-W79w\nSeries 2, Episode 2 ►https://youtu.be/ohRQjQ8AYh8\nSeries 2, Episode 3 ►https://youtu.be/otvA_QLAl70\nSeries 2, Episode 4 ►https://youtu.be/0Qt_ExrTx8E\nSeries 2, Episode 5(FINALE)►https://youtu.be/tqwd5VDEn88\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 1 PLAYLIST:\nCar Trek Episode 1 ► https://youtu.be/Dom6bmnd_Dc\nCar Trek Episode 2 ►https://youtu.be/wPi1BJw-zsc\nCar Trek Episode 3 ►https://youtu.be/SJGWk9nX49U\nCar Trek Episode 4 ►https://youtu.be/9Woe-PnI9qg\nCar Trek Episode 5 ►https://youtu.be/Ug_GRlGQ0_A\nCar Trek Episode 6 ►https://youtu.be/7me9z2Xt90U\nCar Trek Episode 7 (FINALE)► https://youtu.be/LbpHcd1pa8I\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCar Trek on social media:\nInstagram ►https://instagram.com/cartrekoffi...\n\nFreddy \"Tavarish\" Hernandez: \nInstagram ►https://www.instagram.com/therealtava...\nYouTube► https://www.youtube.com/tavarish\n\nTyler Hoover:\nInstagram ►https://www.instagram.com/the_real_ho...\nYouTube ►https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdEc...\n\n@Ed Bolian from @VINwiki \nInstagram► https://www.instagram.com/vinwiki_off...\nYouTube ►https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCefl...\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBIG Thanks to our amazing production crew: \nThomas Durant►https://www.instagram.com/reheracte/\nJordan Cole► https://www.instagram.com/trustinthem...\nBrent Baxter► https://www.instagram.com/sidebproduc...\nVincent Monsaint►https://www.instagram.com/vmonsaint/\nElliot Alvis►https://www.youtube.com/@ElliottAlvis\nTimothy Alsbrooks►https://www.instagram.com/ta_visuals/\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuestions?

Tyler gets flashy and brings a Ferrari 458 Spider that's missing a few things, Ed chooses a nearly perfect Audi R8 V10+ & tries not to fall asleep, & Freddy brings his SEMA show car McLaren 675LT, which may end up being too expensive and too fast for these challenges. They are then shown to Car Wizard for inspection before proving themselves on a real, actual track. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow @reecegold3 on Instagram! \nFight your ticket with The Ticket Clinic!►https://vinwiki.com/r/tc\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n#CarTrek9 #FoundOnAutoTempest #WreckedExotics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAR TREK SERIES 7 PLAYLIST\nSeries 7, Episode 1►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL7TDaOGDAo\nSeries 7, Episode 2►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoC2qH6m3bg\nSeries 7, Episode 3►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96BqVVCpztI\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAR TREK SERIES 6 PLAYLIST\nSeries 6, Episode 1►https://youtu.be/TrTZgv3s4A0\nSeries 6, Episode 2►https://youtu.be/hppd9apHqfM\nSeries 6, Episode 3►https://youtu.be/7dVVbyTurt8\nSeries 6, Episode 4►https://youtu.be/Suhj7SJuEbM\nSeries 6, Episode 5►https://youtu.be/x6MmTpDTkkY\nSeries 6, Episode 6(FINALE)►https://youtu.be/keCS8QZyHsA\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n#StarTrek #FoundOnAutoTempest #GasGuzzlers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 5 PLAYLIST \nSeries 5, Episode 1►https://youtu.be/9-SrII9jMsA\nSeries 5, Episode 2►https://youtu.be/ETmh0sb0jaI\nSeries 5, Episode 3►https://youtu.be/M1SpwlsaiwM\nSeries 5, Episode 4►https://youtu.be/-2_zzwi3Q2Y\nSeries 5, Episode 5►https://youtu.be/4NJ7AxkUjW4\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 4 PLAYLIST\nSeries 4, Episode 1►https://youtu.be/NmwIdGUb3qY\nSeries 4, Episode 2►https://youtu.be/HJZVyoWS9fU\nSeries 4, Episode 3►https://youtu.be/BR51TbFVJZQ\nSeries 4, Episode 4 ►https://youtu.be/I2ySIkH62bw\nSeries 4, Episode 5(FINALE)►https://youtu.be/AQj3Nw1W3_k\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 3 PLAYLIST\nSeries 3, Episode 1►https://youtu.be/TN6E1gyb4qQ\nSeries 3, Episode 2►https://youtu.be/h_YaBjx4P2Q\nSeries 3, Episode 3 ►https://youtu.be/zQbERnh3atc\nSeries 3, Episode 4 ►https://youtu.be/zxP6fYvXR_o\nSeries 3, Episode 5(FINALE)►https://youtu.be/tmymr12wc84\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 2 PLAYLIST:\nSeries 2, Episode 1 ►https://youtu.be/bDAiui-W79w\nSeries 2, Episode 2 ►https://youtu.be/ohRQjQ8AYh8\nSeries 2, Episode 3 ►https://youtu.be/otvA_QLAl70\nSeries 2, Episode 4 ►https://youtu.be/0Qt_ExrTx8E\nSeries 2, Episode 5(FINALE)►https://youtu.be/tqwd5VDEn88\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMPLETE CAR TREK SERIES 1 PLAYLIST:\nCar Trek Episode 1 ► https://youtu.be/Dom6bmnd_Dc\nCar Trek Episode 2 ►https://youtu.be/wPi1BJw-zsc\nCar Trek Episode 3 ►https://youtu.be/SJGWk9nX49U\nCar Trek Episode 4 ►https://youtu.be/9Woe-PnI9qg\nCar Trek Episode 5 ►https://youtu.be/Ug_GRlGQ0_A\nCar Trek Episode 6 ►https://youtu.be/7me9z2Xt90U\nCar Trek Episode 7 (FINALE)► https://youtu.be/LbpHcd1pa8I\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nCar Trek on social media:\nInstagram ►https://instagram.com/cartrekoffi...\n\nFreddy \"Tavarish\" Hernandez: \nInstagram ►https://www.instagram.com/therealtava...\nYouTube► https://www.youtube.com/tavarish\n\nTyler Hoover:\nInstagram ►https://www.instagram.com/the_real_ho...\nYouTube ►https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdEc...\n\n@Ed Bolian from @VINwiki \nInstagram► https://www.instagram.com/vinwiki_off...\nYouTube ►https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCefl...\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBIG Thanks to our amazing production crew: \nThomas Durant►https://www.instagram.com/reheracte/\nJordan Cole► https://www.instagram.com/trustinthem...\nBrent Baxter► https://www.instagram.com/sidebproduc...\nVincent Monsaint►https://www.instagram.com/vmonsaint/\nElliot Alvis►https://www.youtube.com/@ElliottAlvis\nTimothy Alsbrooks►https://www.instagram.com/ta_visuals/\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuestions?

Trabajo como agente de bienes raíces en el área de Beverly Hills de Los Ángeles, en una de las ciudades más encantadoras del mundo. Además de vivir en esta magnífica ciudad, tengo un excelente trabajo que me permite visitar las casas más hermosas del mundo. Cada semana, recorro increíbles casas de lujo en detalle, acompañado por mi camarógrafo Mikey.\n\nMe mudé a Los Ángeles para trabajar en uno de los distritos más prestigiosos del mundo en cuanto a bienes raíces. Pero en realidad, viví toda mi niñez en Alaçati, Izmir. Mi viaje de vida a Los Ángeles inició cuando comencé mi carrera profesional de Windsurf a temprana edad.  se me concedió la Green Card de talento especial en Los Estados Unidos. Estudié en Texas A&M University con beca completa en América, continué con mi carrera de Windsurf al mismo tiempo que estudiaba y comencé a hacer inversiones en el sector inmobiliario. En aquel momento, el sector inmobiliario empezó a ser mi interés más grande y cuando terminé de estudiar, decidí dedicar todo mi tiempo y energía a la construcción y bienes raíces. En poco tiempo, gracias a mi trabajo duro y disciplina (que viene de mi trayectoria como atleta), me convertí en uno de los agentes inmobiliarios más exitosos en el área donde vivo, en Texas. Mientras que el negocio y la vida que creé iban muy bien, repentinamente decidí dejar todo atrás y mudarme a Los Ángeles, la ciudad de mis sueños. Comencé este canal junto con mi carrera en bienes raíces ahí. espero que mis videos y las casas que visito también te inspiren.\nSi te gustaron mis videos, por favor no olvides subscribirte.

Ama aslında bütün çocukluk hayatım Alaçati, Izmir’de gecti. Los Angeles’a kadar uzanan hayat yolculuğum genç yaşta profesyonel Windsurf kariyerine atılmamla başladı. 13 yaşında başladığım Windsurf kariyerimde çeşitli başarılar elde ettim ve bu da benim için o dönemde hayal bile edemeyeceğim birçok farklı kapı açtı. 20 yaşına geldiğimde 3 kez dünya şampiyonu oldum ve bunun sayesinde ABD’deki özel yetenek Green Card’nı almaya hak kazandım.  Amerika’da da tam burs ile Texas A&M Üniversitesi’nde okudum, okulla aynı zamanda Windsurf kariyerimi devam ettirdim ve emlak sektöründe yatırımlar yapmaya başladım. O dönemde emlak sektörü en büyük ilgi alanım olmaya başladı ve okulumu bitirdikten sonra bütün zaman ve enerjimi inşaat ve emlak işlerine harcamaya karar verdim. Kısa bir süre içerisinde sıkı çalışmam ve sporcu kişiliğimden gelen disiplin anlayışım sayesinde Texas’ta yaşadığım bölgenin en başarılı emlakçılardan biri oldum. Orada kurduğum işler ve hayat çok iyi gidiyorken, bir anda her şeyi geride bırakıp hayallerimin şehri olan Los Angeles’a taşınmaya karar verdim. Orada da emlak kariyerimle beraber bu kanala başladım. Güzel mimari ve lüks evlere olan merak ve bilgimi izleyenlerimle paylaşmaktan çok keyif alıyorum, umarım videolarım ve gezdiğim evler sizin de ilginizi çeker.\n\n Eğer videolarımı beğendiyseniz lütfen abone olmayı unutmayın. Herhangi bir sorunuz varsa veya bana bir mesaj iletmek istiyorsanız, aşağıya yorum yapabilirsiniz. Bütün yorumlarıma cevap veriyorum.

Eu sou Enes, corretor de imóveis na área de Beverly Hills, em Los Angeles, uma das cidades mais lindas do mundo. Além de morar nessa cidade maravilhosa, tenho um emprego incrível que me permite visitar casas deslumbrantes. Esse canal é sobre as casas que visito a trabalho e como morador de Los Angeles. Todas as semanas, mostro casas de luxo magníficas em detalhes, acompanhado pelo meu cameraman, Mikey. Com meus vídeos, abro as portas das casas mais fantásticas e especiais para o mundo.\nMudei-me para Los Angeles para trabalhar em um dos distritos imobiliários mais prestigiados do mundo. Antes disso, minha infância foi toda passada em Alaçati, Izmir, e a jornada até Los Angeles começou quando iniciei minha carreira profissional no windsurfe, aos 13 anos de idade. O sucesso que obtive abriu muitas portas que eu não poderia ter imaginado naquela época. Aos 20 anos, fui três vezes campeão mundial e, graças a isso, recebi o green card por habilidades extraordinárias nos EUA. Enquanto continuava a carreira no windsurfe, estudei na Texas A&M University com bolsa integral e comecei a investir no setor imobiliário. Este passou a ser meu principal interesse e, após terminar os estudos, resolvi focar todo o meu tempo e energia no mercado imobiliário e da construção. Em pouco tempo, graças ao trabalho árduo e à disciplina que adquiri na minha formação como atleta, tornei-me um dos corretores mais bem-sucedidos da área onde morava no Texas. Embora o negócio e a vida que eu tinha lá fossem muito bem, de repente decidi deixar tudo para trás e me mudar para Los Angeles, a cidade dos meus sonhos. Foi então que comecei esse canal. Gosto de compartilhar minha curiosidade e meus conhecimentos sobre arquitetura e casas de luxo com meu público e espero que meus vídeos e as casas que visito também inspirem você.\nSe você gostou dos meus vídeos, não se esqueça de se inscrever no canal. Se tiver alguma pergunta ou quiser me mandar uma mensagem, deixe seu comentário abaixo. Eu respondo a todos os comentários. Todos os meus vídeos têm legendas em hindi. Espero que você goste!\nCom muito carinho, Enes Yilmazer (DRE 02077182)\n\nNosso equipamento de filmagem:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/enesyilmazer?listId=1OXA45Y91M6J7\n\nMeus livros favoritos:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/enesyilmazer?listId=2XTUW13ZX2HL7\n\nTrilha do vídeo: https: //www.epidemicsound.com/referra\n\n#MansionTour #ModernMansion #LuxuryHomeTour #MichaelJordan #MichaelJordanResidence #MichaelJordanMansionTour\n\nCreated by Enes Yilmazer (DRE 02077182) - @EnesYilmazer\nFilmed by @AyersWorld , @Jaysonk0312 , @Ermanalkis \nEdited by @AyersWorld ,  @create.james ,  @Jaysonk0312, @Luis__f\n\nTime Codes:\n00:00 Michael Jordan\n02:10 Driveway, Introduction\n04:31 Entry, Formal Living Room, Office\n07:57 Dining Area, Kitchen\n10:20 Family Room, Trophy Room\n11:57 Pool Area, Outdoor Dining, \n13:25 Pool Pavilion, Patio, Bar\n15:57 Guest House\n17:56 Basketball Pavilion, Basketball Court\n20:09 Entertainment Area, Gym, Movie Theatre\n24:13 Guest Suites, Lounge, Top Floor Bar\n28:28 Pond, Putting Green, Grounds\n29:46 Night Tour\n30:23 Outro"

After Ammar took Seekers on adventures this year and also sponsored Nelly Attar to climb K2, I would like to also say thank you to those who support us through Seek Discomfort this holiday by taking a small group of 3 of you who purchase from Seek this Holiday on an adventure somewhere next year. We will contact the 3 adventurers by January 31st. If you have already purchased this holiday, you're already good to go :) if you'd like a chance to join me, you know where to go! ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ \n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort\n\nWhen it comes to what happened at the end.. It really shook me, we felt with the local team that we'd really prepared the best we could but sometimes unexpected problems like this one can happen. We've checked several times and everyone there is fine, they were really just looking for me. Nothing like this had really happened before even though I have experience traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and I understand that there are things you can and cannot do. I went home after this trip to mentally recuperate and recharge.\n\n//\n\n✈ Book an Adventure: https://travel.yestheory.com/\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n⁺ Seek Discomfort: https://www.youtube.com/seekdiscomfort\n📝 Follow Matt’s Newsletter: http://yestheory.com/newsletter/\n📸 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n🐦 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n🎬  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n\n☮️ If you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\n🎥 HOW WE MAKE OUR VIDEOS\n\n🎵 Where we find our music:\n1- Epidemic Sound.

After Ammar took Seekers on adventures this year and also sponsored Nelly Attar to climb K2, I would like to also say thank you to those who support us through Seek Discomfort this holiday by taking a small group of 3 of you who purchase from Seek this Holiday on an adventure somewhere next year. We will contact the 3 adventurers by January 31st. If you have already purchased this holiday, you're already good to go :) if you'd like a chance to join me, you know where to go! ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ \n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort\n\nWhen it comes to what happened at the end.. It really shook me, we felt with the local team that we'd really prepared the best we could but sometimes unexpected problems like this one can happen. We've checked several times and everyone there is fine, they were really just looking for me. Nothing like this had really happened before even though I have experience traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and I understand that there are things you can and cannot do. I went home after this trip to mentally recuperate and recharge.\n\n//\n\n✈ Book an Adventure: https://travel.yestheory.com/\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n⁺ Seek Discomfort: https://www.youtube.com/seekdiscomfort\n📝 Follow Matt’s Newsletter: http://yestheory.com/newsletter/\n📸 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n🐦 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n🎬  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n\n☮️ If you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\n🎥 HOW WE MAKE OUR VIDEOS\n\n🎵 Where we find our music:\n1- Epidemic Sound.

This upsets me as much as it does you, and as frustrating as it might be to hear, I really do think it’s right. There’s just too much evidence surrounding Baby being the one working from the shadows to run Fazbear Entertainment to ignore. I believe she’s doing her best to follow through on the promise she made back in FNAF 6, “I will make you proud, Daddy.” So lower your pitchforks, put out those torches… and hear me out with this one.\n\nCredit to @Jaze Cinema  for the animation ►  https://youtu.be/0LscZnLfNEc\n\nMake Sure You Grab My New Wearable ARG Jacket From TheoryWear Before It’s Gone! ► https://bit.ly/3tUevKi \n\nGet Your TheoryWear! ►  https://theorywear.com/\nCheck out the Reddit! ► https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/   \nSUBSCRIBE to Catch all the Theories! ► https://goo.gl/kQWHkJ    \n\nNeed Royalty Free Music for your Content?

            "description": "Only the second time that an undefeated Michigan and an undefeated Ohio State have faced off in the final game of the regular season led to one of the most highly anticipated college football game in years. No. 3 Michigan traveled to Columbus, Ohio to take on No. 2 Ohio State in ‘The Shoe’. The Buckeyes came out on fire, until a few long touchdowns from the Wolverines calmed the nerves. Marvin Harrison Jr. caught a TD just before halftime to give Ohio State the 20-17 edge going into the break. In the second half, everything changed. J.J. McCarthy looked outstanding. He finished the game with 263 pass yards and three touchdowns. Donovan Edwards stepped up huge, including the final two dagger touchdown runs to finish the game with 216 rush yards. No. 3 Michigan defeated No. 2 Ohio State in Columbus for the first time since 2000. The Wolverines will play in the Big Ten Championship game in back-to-back years next week.\n\n#CFBonFOX #CFB #MichiganVsOhioState\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest CFB on FOX content: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n \nSee more from CFB on FOX: https://foxs.pt/CFBONFOXFoxSports\nLike CFB on FOX on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/CFBONFOXFacebook\nFollow CFB on FOX on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/CFBONFOXTwitter\nFollow CFB on FOX on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/CFBONFOXInstagram\n\nAbout CFB on FOX:\nThe official home for college football on FOX — the biggest names, the biggest games, the highlights, the moments, and everything you need as a college football fan.

The Impostor's goal is to Sabotage their ship and get everyone. The Crewmates need to complete tasks and vote out the Impostor.\n\n► Can I play this mod?\nNope! These mods are currently private, and we are NOT planning on releasing them currently.\n\n► Can I give you mod ideas?\nOf course! I read comments all of the time, and take YOUR suggestions when it comes to creating new ideas and ways to mod Among Us. Leave a comment with your idea and you may just see it in a future video!\n\n► How do you talk to each other in game?\nWe use \"BetterCrewLink\", which is an update on the popular CrewLink mod.

Thanks a lot for the support!\n\nSources & further reading:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/sources-supernovadeath\n\nSupernovae are the most powerful explosions in the universe, unleashing enough energy to outshine galaxies.
