ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

            "description": "Anamaria Sayre | December 12, 2024\nSaudade is a Portuguese word that can be roughly defined as a feeling of melancholy, nostalgia or yearning for something that is beloved but not present. There's no perfect translation, but one of the closest English expressions of the word I've ever seen is Billie Eilish's Tiny Desk performance.\n\nYou'd think the Los Angeles-born singer invented the term. Every breath is so full of indulgent melancholy, hopeful regret, at 22 years old she's become a captivating fixture of what it means, or rather what it feels, to love and lose simultaneously.\n\nTrading belting vocals and rocking guitar for gentle piano and almost-breaking falsetto, she reimagines tracks like \"THE GREATEST\" in their most raw and honest form. In Eilish's world, love's purest forms are inherently terrifying. Therein lies her starpower – she effortlessly, relentlessly brings to the fore the trickier emotions many of us tuck away for fear of what the world might think.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm crying for, I don't think I could love you more,\" she sings on \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER.\" Turns out the world is made up of a lot of people who just want to be seen, and this stripped down set is the perfect space for Eilish to give listeners just that.\n\nSET LIST\n\"THE GREATEST\"\n\"L'AMOUR DE MA VIE\"\n\"i love you\"\n\"BIRDS OF A FEATHER\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBillie Eilish: vocals\nFinneas: guitar\nAndrew Marshall: drums\nSolo Smith: bass\nAbe Nouri: piano\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #billieeilish \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Better Help, committed to making mental well-being a priority\nand offering support in taking on everything life demands.

Este video explora la historia y el impacto de la placa de clavos múltiples, una invención simple pero revolucionaria que transformó la construcción residencial y aceleró el crecimiento suburbano.\n\nOriginalmente ideada para combatir los daños causados ​​por huracanes en lugares como Miami a mediados de siglo, la placa de clavos múltiples permitió a los constructores conectar de manera rápida y segura múltiples piezas de madera en prácticamente cualquier ángulo. Al permitir la producción en masa de cerchas para techos en fábricas externas, se logró una construcción más resistente, más barata y más eficiente. Esta eficiencia abrió la puerta a espaciosas plantas abiertas, líneas de techo complejas, techos estilo catedral y la estética de las mansiones gigantescas, todo lo cual ha llegado a definir gran parte de la arquitectura suburbana estadounidense.\n\nSin embargo, la influencia de esta modesta invención no es del todo positiva. Si bien ayudó a agilizar los procesos de construcción y a reducir los costos, también fomentó una rápida expansión de la vivienda y viviendas más grandes y que consumen más recursos. El resultado fue un cambio arquitectónico que contribuyó a la expansión suburbana, al aumento de las demandas energéticas y a que las viviendas fueran tratadas cada vez más como productos básicos en lugar de espacios únicos y hechos a mano. Estos cambios repercutieron en los códigos de construcción, los mercados inmobiliarios e incluso la vida familiar, influyendo en la forma en que interactuamos con nuestras casas y con los demás.\n\n__Temas tratados__\n+ Orígenes de la placa de clavos múltiples en regiones propensas a huracanes\n+ Evolución de la construcción de techos desde vigas tradicionales hasta cerchas prefabricadas\n+ El auge de los planos de planta abiertos, los techos estilo catedral y el diseño suburbano de “mansiones gigantes”\n+ Impactos en el uso de la madera, los códigos de construcción y la fabricación fuera del sitio\n+ Cómo estos cambios moldearon la expansión suburbana, la estética arquitectónica y los mercados inmobiliarios\n+ Las consecuencias no deseadas en la sostenibilidad, los valores de las viviendas y la dinámica familiar\n\n__Términos clave para futuras investigaciones__\n+ Placa de clavos múltiples\n+ Tecnología de cerchas de techo\n+ Componentes de viviendas prefabricadas\nArquitectura de mansiones gigantes\n+ Expansión suburbana\n+ Construcción resistente a huracanes\n+ Planos de planta abiertos y techos estilo catedral\n+ Auge y colapso del mercado inmobiliario\n+ Evolución del código de construcción\n\n__Membresía__\nÚnase a este canal para obtener acceso a Beneficios:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join\n\n__Acerca del canal__\nArchitecture with Stewart es un viaje en YouTube que explora las historias profundas y duraderas de la arquitectura en todo su asombroso esplendor.

Este vídeo explora a história e o impacto da placa gang-nail, uma invenção simples, mas revolucionária, que transformou a construção residencial e acelerou o crescimento suburbano.\n\nOriginalmente concebida para combater danos causados ​​por furacões em lugares como Miami em meados do século, a placa gang-nail permitiu que os construtores conectassem de forma rápida e segura várias peças de madeira em praticamente qualquer ângulo. Ao permitir a produção em massa de treliças de telhado em fábricas externas, isso levou a uma construção mais forte, mais barata e mais eficiente. Essa eficiência abriu as portas para plantas baixas espaçosas e abertas, linhas de telhado complexas, tetos de catedral e a estética extensa de McMansion, todos os quais definiram grande parte da arquitetura suburbana americana.\n\nNo entanto, a influência dessa invenção despretensiosa não é totalmente positiva. Embora tenha ajudado a agilizar os processos de construção e a cortar custos, também encorajou a rápida expansão habitacional e casas maiores e com mais recursos. O resultado foi uma mudança arquitetônica que contribuiu para a expansão suburbana, aumento das demandas de energia e casas cada vez mais tratadas como commodities em vez de espaços únicos e artesanais.

Questo video esplora la storia e l'impatto della piastra chiodata, un'invenzione semplice ma rivoluzionaria che ha trasformato l'edilizia residenziale e accelerato la crescita suburbana.\n\nOriginariamente ideata per combattere i danni causati dagli uragani in luoghi come la Miami di metà secolo, la piastra chiodata ha consentito ai costruttori di collegare rapidamente e in modo sicuro più pezzi di legname praticamente a qualsiasi angolazione. Abilitando la produzione in serie di capriate in fabbriche fuori sede, ha portato a una costruzione più solida, economica ed efficiente. Questa efficienza ha aperto le porte a spaziose planimetrie aperte, complesse linee del tetto, soffitti a cattedrale e all'estetica tentacolare delle McMansion, tutte cose che sono arrivate a definire gran parte dell'architettura suburbana americana.\n\nTuttavia, l'influenza di questa modesta invenzione non è del tutto positiva. Mentre ha contribuito a semplificare i processi di costruzione e a ridurre i costi, ha anche incoraggiato una rapida espansione abitativa e case più grandi e ad alta intensità di risorse. Il risultato è stato un cambiamento architettonico che ha contribuito all'espansione urbana, all'aumento della domanda di energia e alle case sempre più trattate come merci piuttosto che come spazi unici e artigianali. Questi cambiamenti hanno riverberato attraverso i codici edilizi, i mercati immobiliari e persino la vita familiare, influenzando il modo in cui interagiamo con le nostre case e gli uni con gli altri.\n\n__Argomenti trattati__\n+ Origini della piastra a chiodi gang nelle regioni soggette a uragani\n+ Evoluzione della costruzione del tetto dalle travi tradizionali alle capriate prefabbricate\n+ L'ascesa di planimetrie aperte, soffitti a cattedrale e design suburbano \"McMansion\"\n+ Impatti sull'uso del legname, codici edilizi e produzione fuori sede\n+ Come questi cambiamenti hanno plasmato l'espansione urbana suburbana, l'estetica architettonica e i mercati immobiliari\n+ Le conseguenze indesiderate sulla sostenibilità, sui valori delle case e sulle dinamiche familiari\n\n__Termini chiave per ulteriori ricerche__\n+ Piastra a chiodi gang\n+ Tecnologia delle capriate del tetto\n+ Componenti di alloggi prefabbricati\nArchitettura McMansion\n+ Espansione urbana suburbana\n+ Costruzione resistente agli uragani\n+ Planimetrie aperte e soffitti a cattedrale\n+ Boom e crollo del mercato immobiliare\n+ Evoluzione del codice edilizio\n\n__Iscrizione__\nUnisciti a questo canale per avere accesso a vantaggi:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join\n\n__Informazioni sul canale__\nArchitecture with Stewart è un viaggio su YouTube che esplora le storie profonde e durature dell'architettura in tutta la loro sconcertante gloria.

Cette vidéo explore l’histoire et l’impact de la plaque à clous multiples, une invention simple mais révolutionnaire qui a transformé la construction résidentielle et accéléré la croissance des banlieues.\n\nConçue à l’origine pour lutter contre les dégâts causés par les ouragans dans des endroits comme Miami au milieu du siècle, la plaque à clous multiples a permis aux constructeurs de connecter rapidement et en toute sécurité plusieurs pièces de bois à pratiquement n’importe quel angle. En permettant la production en masse de fermes de toit dans des usines hors site, cette invention a permis une construction plus solide, moins chère et plus efficace. Cette efficacité a ouvert la voie à des plans d’étage ouverts et spacieux, à des lignes de toit complexes, à des plafonds cathédrale et à l’esthétique tentaculaire des McMansions, qui ont fini par définir une grande partie de l’architecture suburbaine américaine. \n\nPourtant, l’influence de cette invention sans prétention n’est pas entièrement positive. Si elle a contribué à rationaliser les processus de construction et à réduire les coûts, elle a également encouragé une expansion rapide du logement et des maisons plus grandes et plus gourmandes en ressources. Le résultat a été un changement architectural qui a contribué à l’étalement urbain, à l’augmentation des besoins énergétiques et à la transformation des maisons en produits de base plutôt qu’en espaces uniques et artisanaux. Ces changements se sont répercutés sur les codes du bâtiment, les marchés immobiliers et même la vie de famille, influençant la façon dont nous interagissons avec nos maisons et les uns avec les autres. \n\n__Sujets abordés__\n+ Origines de la plaque à clous dans les régions sujettes aux ouragans\n+ Évolution de la construction de toits des chevrons traditionnels aux fermes préfabriquées\n+ L'essor des plans d'étage ouverts, des plafonds cathédrale et de la conception de « McMansion » de banlieue\n+ Impacts sur l'utilisation du bois, les codes du bâtiment et la fabrication hors site\n+ Comment ces changements ont façonné l'étalement urbain, l'esthétique architecturale et les marchés du logement\n+ Les conséquences imprévues sur la durabilité, la valeur des maisons et la dynamique familiale\n\n__Termes clés pour des recherches plus approfondies__\n+ Plaque à clous\n+ Technologie des fermes de toit\n+ Composants de logements préfabriqués\nArchitecture McMansion\n+ Étalement de banlieue\n+ Construction résistante aux ouragans\n+ Plans d'étage ouverts et plafonds cathédrale\n+ Boom et effondrement du marché du logement\n+ Évolution du code du bâtiment\n\n__Adhésion__\nRejoignez cette chaîne pour avoir accès à Avantages :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join\n\n__À propos de la chaîne__\nArchitecture with Stewart est un voyage sur YouTube qui explore les histoires profondes et durables de l'architecture dans toute leur splendeur déconcertante.

Dieses Video untersucht die Geschichte und die Auswirkungen der Gangnagelplatte, einer einfachen, aber revolutionären Erfindung, die den Wohnungsbau verändert und das Wachstum der Vororte beschleunigt hat.\n\nUrsprünglich entwickelt, um Hurrikanschäden an Orten wie Miami Mitte des Jahrhunderts zu bekämpfen, ermöglichte die Gangnagelplatte den Bauarbeitern, mehrere Holzstücke in praktisch jedem Winkel schnell und sicher zu verbinden. Durch die Massenproduktion von Dachstühlen in externen Fabriken führte dies zu stärkeren, billigeren und effizienteren Bauten. Diese Effizienz öffnete die Tür zu großzügigen offenen Grundrissen, komplexen Dachlinien, hohen Decken und der Ästhetik der weitläufigen McMansion-Häuser, die heute einen Großteil der amerikanischen Vorstadtarchitektur prägen.\n\nDoch der Einfluss dieser unscheinbaren Erfindung ist nicht nur positiv. Zwar half sie dabei, Bauprozesse zu rationalisieren und Kosten zu senken, doch förderte sie auch eine schnelle Expansion des Wohnungsbaus und größere, ressourcenintensivere Häuser. Das Ergebnis war ein architektonischer Wandel, der zur Zersiedelung der Vorstädte, einem erhöhten Energiebedarf und dazu beitrug, dass Häuser zunehmend als Gebrauchsgegenstände und nicht als einzigartige, handgefertigte Räume behandelt wurden. Diese Veränderungen wirkten sich auf Bauvorschriften, Immobilienmärkte und sogar das Familienleben aus und beeinflussten, wie wir mit unseren Häusern und miteinander umgehen.\n\n__Behandelte Themen__\n+ Ursprünge der Gangnagelplatte in Hurrikan-gefährdeten Regionen\n+ Entwicklung der Dachkonstruktion von traditionellen Sparren zu vorgefertigten Dachstühlen\n+ Der Aufstieg offener Grundrisse, Kathedralendecken und vorstädtischer „McMansion“-Bauweise\n+ Auswirkungen auf Holznutzung, Bauvorschriften und Fertigung außerhalb des Standorts\n+ Wie diese Veränderungen die Zersiedelung der Vororte, die architektonische Ästhetik und den Wohnungsmarkt geprägt haben\n+ Die unbeabsichtigten Folgen für Nachhaltigkeit, Immobilienwerte und Familiendynamik\n\n__Schlüsselbegriffe für weitere Forschung__\n+ Gangnagelplatte\n+ Dachstuhltechnologie\n+ Vorgefertigte Wohnkomponenten\nMcMansion-Architektur\n+ Zersiedelung der Vororte\n+ Hurrikansichere Konstruktion\n+ Offene Grundrisse und Kathedralendecken\n+ Boom und Zusammenbruch des Wohnungsmarkts\n+ Entwicklung der Bauvorschriften\n\n__Mitgliedschaft__\nWerden Sie Mitglied dieses Kanals, um Zugriff zu erhalten auf Vorteile:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join\n\n__Über den Kanal__\nArchitecture with Stewart ist eine YouTube-Reise, die die tiefgründigen und beständigen Geschichten der Architektur in all ihrer verblüffenden Pracht erkundet.

From the Spring and Autumn period of Ancient China, to the wacky atomic antics of the Cold War, history is PACKED full of whimsical warfare decisions that make into lovely little bite-sized YouTube videos :) \n\nWhile the stories of the ANZAC retreat in Gallipoli using drip rifles and a chicken-warmed nuclear landmine from the Cold War are easily verifiable, the tales of self throat-cutting soldiers and Alexander's Siege on Tyre are harder to verify. Alexander's story, on one hand, has strong physical evidence. We can see the remains of the causeway he constructed in Lebanon to this day. But for the details of these stories, the sequences of events, and specific actions and outcomes, we have to rely on the word of scarce few sources. Most of what we know about Alexander the Great, for instance, comes from a few historians writing about him many years after he lived, utilizing primary sources that no longer exist for us to corroborate. The same can be said about King Goujian of Yue, whose sources write about him around a hundred years after the fact. The biggest takeaway for me in this video's research process is that Ancient History is never something we will be able to fully determine. Much of what we know comes from a handful of sources, some of which are known to have lied or exaggerated, requiring us as students of history to use our best judgement and knowledge to decipher the most believable, \"true story.\" Studying Ancient History requires a bit of faith, because if we hold the tales of millenniums ago to the same standards as today's reporting, we know absolutely and positively nothing.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nDrip Rifle:\nhttps://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/gallipoli/drip_rifle\nhttps://anzacportal.dva.gov.au/wars-and-missions/ww1/where-australians-served/gallipoli/evacuations-from-anzac\nhttps://ngatapuwae.govt.nz/insights/desperate-thirst/index.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_campaign#Evacuation\n\nGoujian: \n- Paul A Cohen, History and Popular Memory: The Power of Story in Moments of Crisis\n- Paul A Cohen, Speaking to History: The Story of King Goujian in Twentieth-Century China\n- “Yue wang Goujian shijia\" chapter of Shiji (see Takigawa, Shiki kaichù kösho, vol. 5, juan 41, 3) For a translation of the Shiji account, see Szuma Chien, Selections from Records of the Historian, 47.\n- The Zuozhuan, under \"Lu Ding gong\" (Duke Ding of Lu) fourteenth year (see The Ch'un Ts'ew with the Tso Chuen, 786).\n- The Art of War\n\nSiege of Tyre\n- The Seventeenth Book of Diodorus Siculus\n- Arrian’s The Campaigns of Alexander\n\nBlue Peacock\n- http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3588465.stm\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peacock\n- https://allthatsinteresting.com/blue-peacock",

From the Spring and Autumn period of Ancient China, to the wacky atomic antics of the Cold War, history is PACKED full of whimsical warfare decisions that make into lovely little bite-sized YouTube videos :) \n\nWhile the stories of the ANZAC retreat in Gallipoli using drip rifles and a chicken-warmed nuclear landmine from the Cold War are easily verifiable, the tales of self throat-cutting soldiers and Alexander's Siege on Tyre are harder to verify. Alexander's story, on one hand, has strong physical evidence. We can see the remains of the causeway he constructed in Lebanon to this day. But for the details of these stories, the sequences of events, and specific actions and outcomes, we have to rely on the word of scarce few sources. Most of what we know about Alexander the Great, for instance, comes from a few historians writing about him many years after he lived, utilizing primary sources that no longer exist for us to corroborate. The same can be said about King Goujian of Yue, whose sources write about him around a hundred years after the fact. The biggest takeaway for me in this video's research process is that Ancient History is never something we will be able to fully determine. Much of what we know comes from a handful of sources, some of which are known to have lied or exaggerated, requiring us as students of history to use our best judgement and knowledge to decipher the most believable, \"true story.\" Studying Ancient History requires a bit of faith, because if we hold the tales of millenniums ago to the same standards as today's reporting, we know absolutely and positively nothing.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nDrip Rifle:\nhttps://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/gallipoli/drip_rifle\nhttps://anzacportal.dva.gov.au/wars-and-missions/ww1/where-australians-served/gallipoli/evacuations-from-anzac\nhttps://ngatapuwae.govt.nz/insights/desperate-thirst/index.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_campaign#Evacuation\n\nGoujian: \n- Paul A Cohen, History and Popular Memory: The Power of Story in Moments of Crisis\n- Paul A Cohen, Speaking to History: The Story of King Goujian in Twentieth-Century China\n- “Yue wang Goujian shijia\" chapter of Shiji (see Takigawa, Shiki kaichù kösho, vol. 5, juan 41, 3) For a translation of the Shiji account, see Szuma Chien, Selections from Records of the Historian, 47.\n- The Zuozhuan, under \"Lu Ding gong\" (Duke Ding of Lu) fourteenth year (see The Ch'un Ts'ew with the Tso Chuen, 786).\n- The Art of War\n\nSiege of Tyre\n- The Seventeenth Book of Diodorus Siculus\n- Arrian’s The Campaigns of Alexander\n\nBlue Peacock\n- http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3588465.stm\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peacock\n- https://allthatsinteresting.com/blue-peacock"

This standalone spin-off throws weapons, enemies and bosses from Elden Ring into a new co-op roguelike set in an alternate version of Limgrave, with new \"hero\" characters with unique abilities replacing the usual RPG create-a-character. Here's what we learned from 6 hours playing Nightreign at FromSoftware's offices in Tokyo.\n\n#eldenring #gaming #pcgaming #exclusive \n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:28 - Three player co-op\n2:30 - Premium-priced\n3:05 - Predefined characters\n5:46 - Not a battle royale, but it kinda looks like one\n7:14 - How does it play?\n9:49 - Randomly generated map?\n12:47 - Loot system\n14:59 - Meta progression\n16:39 - Not an RPG\n17:53 - When can you play it?\n\nX: https://x.com/pcgamer\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@pcgamer_mag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pcgamer_mag/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pcgamermagazine/\nForum: https://forums.pcgamer.com/\n\nTo subscribe to the magazine in the US, UK, or elsewhere, visit magazines direct.\n\nPC Gamer is the global authority on PC games.

Check out https://joshjohnsoncomedy.com/tour for dates and to sign up for the waitlist to be notified when I'm performing in your city.\n\nHi friends,\n\nThis week I wanted to share my thoughts on Drake suing UMG, iheartradio, and Spotify. \n\nDrake is known for songs like hotling bling, wants and needs, God’s plan and more billboard top charting songs than many can count. \nHis albums also include, nothing was the same, what a time to be alive, honestly nevermind, if you’re reading this it’s too late, scorpion, views, and many more. \n\nHis downfall can be attributed to Kendrick Lamar who just released GNX a fiery west coast project that has set the world off. \n\nIf you love my stories I have a podcast that comes out every week: https://bit.ly/3NQmpio \n\nHit me on them internets: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@joshjohnsoncomedy \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy Video \n\nRecorded at Rodney's in New York, NY"

Originalmente íbamos a usar el estilo híbrido de animátic, pero después de tener la mitad del episodio hecho y verlo, personalmente no me gustó cómo se veía, así que decidí esforzarme durante 3-4 meses adicionales para animarlo completamente. Casi me mata.\n\nEspero que disfruten este episodio con un cliff hanger. ¡Ash y yo ya estamos preparando el episodio 5!

Sign up now at https://youtube.com/pivotpod\n\nI aint dream of winning the Heisman, I dreamed of being #1.” Travis Hunter\n\nFresh off his Heisman nomination, Travis Hunter is sitting with Ryan, Channing and Fred opening up in a way you haven't heard before, touching on both personal and professional aspects of his life as he tries to navigate his fame, future, football and family life as everything seems to be falling into a place for the college football standout and this year’s top NFL draft prospect. \n\nTravis Hunter, a young phenom taking the sports world by storm, says he is unlike any football player we’ve seen before, and it’s hard to argue against him right now. Hunter’s ability to play two positions at both wide receiver and cornerback has been under the microscope every step of his journey and Channing adds more fuel to the fire when he proposes a potential debacle that Travis may see himself in next year if he is forced to choose one side of the ball. Travis has dealt with the pressure that his ability brings on, the questions it raises and has leaned on those who have always been close to him to get him through all the challenges but in reality, there is no reason for Travis to answer critics because his on field play and talent speak for itself.  \n\nA large part of Travis’ success stems from the relationships he has forged and the people who continue to support him, especially his fiancee Leanna. Off the top, Travis takes time to clear the air about a video from after his final Colorado home game that went viral, explaining the depth of his relationship with Leanna and what the two have gone through from the start. \n\nBut the relationship he credits to his life forever changing is the one he has with his coach, Deion Sanders, as Travis reflects on his journey to greatness - from when he first met Coach Prime in high school, to committing to Jackson State to transferring to Colorado to now becoming a Heisman hopeful and the front runner for the top NFL top draft spot. \n\nFrom that bond with Deion, a brotherhood between Travis and Deion’s son, Shedeur Sanders, was born and since has brought the best out of each of the young athletes. Travis shares how Shedeur and himself have been able to put their pride aside when they compete and gives insight on what it’s like to have two dogs go at it together and how grateful he is to both Shedeur and Shilo for allowing him to be so close to their father on this journey too. Travis, along with the Sanders’, has transformed college football from their impact with HBCU’s to elevating Colorado’s popularity to proving it’s ok to go against the grain to chase dreams and shake up the norm! \n\nOn the field, Travis is rewriting the standard, excelling as both a wide receiver and cornerback.  With 14 touchdowns and four interceptions this season, he’s proving that he’s built to dominate on both sides of the ball. Determined to make history as a two-way player in the NFL, His confidence, paired with the unique bond he shares with Coach Prime, has landed him as one of the rare non-Quarterback Heisman finalists in the award’s history. \n\nBut what does winning the Heisman mean to Travis? More than just a trophy, it’s a milestone he wants to dedicate to his family, He said there will be some tears but just proof that the hard work and sacrifices are worth it as this is one step closer to Travis' true dream...to be drafted Number One overall in this year's NFL Draft.\n\nDon’t miss this layered but conversation filled with laughs, humility and big dreams  as Travis Hunter shares a side of him the world hasn't seen yet while on the verge making history.
