Built with aerospace-grade titanium for our lightest, most powerful Pro models ever.\n\nThe new Pro camera system pushes the limits of what’s possible on a smartphone, giving photographers the equivalent of seven pro lenses ranging from 13 mm on the Ultra Wide camera to 120 mm on the 5x Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nFilmmakers can now record video in ProRes 4K at 60 fps directly to an external drive. The addition of a USB-C connector brings superfast USB 3 transfer speeds, along with support for pro formats that massively improve the workflow between shooting and post-production.\n\nThe new design also includes a customizable Action button for quicker access to your favorite feature.*\n\nAnd the A17 Pro chip with a 6-core GPU introduces a whole new level of immersive mobile gaming performance. \n\nIn short, the new titanium iPhone 15 Pro is our most powerful photo-taking, movie-making, game-playing iPhone ever.\n\nLearn more about iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max: https://apple.co/3PBuiJq\n\nAudio Descriptions: https://apple.co/44QCI3W\n\n#AppleEvent #iPhone15Pro #iPhone\n\n*Translate action is coming in an update later this year\n\nWelcome to the official Apple YouTube channel.

The addition of a USB-C connector brings superfast USB 3 transfer speeds, along with support for pro formats that massively improve the workflow between shooting and post-production.\n\nThe new design also includes a customizable Action button for quicker access to your favorite feature.*\n\nAnd the A17 Pro chip with a 6-core GPU introduces a whole new level of immersive mobile gaming performance. \n\nIn short, the new titanium iPhone 15 Pro is our most powerful photo-taking, movie-making, game-playing iPhone ever.\n\nLearn more about iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max: https://apple.co/3PBuiJq\n\nAudio Descriptions: https://apple.co/44QCI3W\n\n#AppleEvent #iPhone15Pro #iPhone\n\n*Translate action is coming in an update later this year\n\nWelcome to the official Apple YouTube channel. Here you’ll find news about product launches, tutorials, and other great content. Apple’s more than 160,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it."

There are plenty of other phones (including the Apple iPhone 14 and 13 models) out there that are just as good depending on your needs. The iPhone 15 Pro Max could be overpriced at launch and might not have any features that stand out for your needs. Instead, spend your hard-earned cash on something more worth your money!\n\nShould you upgrade to the latest Apple iPhone 15 this year? Or should you look at alternatives? Is the iPhone 13 or 14 Pro Max for example still a good alternative? Could you afford to wait for the iPhone 15? \n\nApple's iPhone 15 promises a few upgrades, a bigger battery, better camera specs and a new A17 chip. Are these upgrades significant? Join me in this video as we discuss where it may not make sense to upgrade to the iPhone 15. And also where it absolutely does make sense to upgrade. \n\nEven if you decided that you are upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, in some cases, an upgrade is inevitable right? \n\nBut even in those cases, it can be confusing on which model of the iPhone 15 should you go for.

            "description": "If you want to snag the safiya x holo taco collection (or any of the individual colors) - you can check out all the products here!! 🦇💿 https://holota.co/safiyaxholotaco \n\nHOLO FRIENDS!! Buckle up & get your fingernails ready, cause this one is a wild ride! a few years ago, I had the crazy idea to make a custom food truck of some sort - I just needed the perfect opportunity to do it. So when Cristine and I decided to create a Holo Taco collection together, I thought why not now - let's make a (holo) taco truck!! \n\nSo we took a super old FedEx truck and renovated it into a batty, vampy, ~holographic~ nail polish truck! Once it was finished, we loaded an army of nail polish into the truck and drove it around to several different meet ups around Raleigh. At each location, we gave away some free nail polish, saw lots of great nail art (a decent amount of which is featured in this video), & gave out some other fiendish goodies for you guys to enjoy (think chocolate & boba)!! \n\nThank you to everyone who could make the event!! What do you guys think of our nail polish truck? What should we turn the truck into next??\n\nAnd now, we’ve finally reached the release date of the safiya x Holo Taco collection!!

Once it was finished, we loaded an army of nail polish into the truck and drove it around to several different meet ups around Raleigh. At each location, we gave away some free nail polish, saw lots of great nail art (a decent amount of which is featured in this video), & gave out some other fiendish goodies for you guys to enjoy (think chocolate & boba)!! \n\nThank you to everyone who could make the event!! What do you guys think of our nail polish truck? What should we turn the truck into next??\n\nAnd now, we’ve finally reached the release date of the safiya x Holo Taco collection!!

                "description": "Injury-time goals from Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus gave us a dramatic late comeback win at Emirates Stadium.\n\nMarcus Rashford had fired the visitors ahead on 27 minutes with their first attack, only for Martin Odegaard to immediately crash home a leveller.\n\nKai Havertz and Bukayo Saka both spurned good chances – either side if the interval – and the second-half had been dominated by two big VAR interventions. The first revered a penalty decision, when it appeared Havertz had been fouled, the second ruled out a late United goal for offside.\n\nBut the real drama was yet to come. A corner fell to Rice at the far post in the 96th minute, and he controlled on his chest before crashing home his shot inside the near post.\n\nEmirates Stadium was bouncing, and with virtually the last kick of the game Jesus raced away to add a late third on the break.\n\n#arsenal #declanrice \n\nEnjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Emile Smith Rowe, Vivianne Miedema, Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Leah Williamson, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White and more.\n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

            "description": "A few months ago we met the Thai British F1 driver Alex Albon at an event and invited him to go out and try some Korean food. Alex is one of only 20 Formula One drivers in the world, and is ranked amongst the very best drivers on the grid. He’s driven for Toro Rosso, Red Bull and most recently for Williams. During the mid-season break he took time out of his busy schedule to meet us at one of my favourite London BBQ spots for some food and a chat.\n\nThank you to Alex and his team for giving their time to film!\nAll the best for the Singapore Grand Prix!\n\nToday's video is not sponsored, but let's support local businesses!\nYou can find : Chung'dam London, 35-36 Greek St, London W1D 5DL\n\n--\n\n몇달 전에 저희가 어떤 행사에서 태국계 영국 F1 레이싱 선수 알렉스 알본님을 만나뵈었는데요. 한국 음식을 소개해드리고 싶어서 언제 꼭 식사 대접하고 싶다고 말씀드렸죠. 참고로, 알렉스 님은 전 세계에서 20명에게만 주어지는 ' 포뮬러 원 드라이버' 라는 타이틀을 갖고 계실뿐만 아니라 그 중에서도 거의 탑급인 선수시죠. 토로 로쏘, 레드불 팀을 거쳐 현재는 윌리엄스 소속으로 뛰고 계신데요. 이번에 시즌 중에 잠깐 공백이 생긴 틈을 타, 특별히 저희를 위해 시간을 내주셔서 제가 가장 좋아하는 고깃집에 모시고 가서 식사하며 이야기를 나누게 되었답니다.\n\n저희에게 시간과 촬영에 협조해주신 알렉스 선수님과 팀에게 감사의 말씀을 전합니다!\n\n오늘 영상에 광고는 포함되어 있지 않지만, 지역 상인 여러분 늘 응원합니다!\n주소: Chung'dam London, 35-36 Greek St, London W1D 5DL",

During the mid-season break he took time out of his busy schedule to meet us at one of my favourite London BBQ spots for some food and a chat.\n\nThank you to Alex and his team for giving their time to film!\nAll the best for the Singapore Grand Prix!\n\nToday's video is not sponsored, but let's support local businesses!\nYou can find : Chung'dam London, 35-36 Greek St, London W1D 5DL\n\n--\n\n몇달 전에 저희가 어떤 행사에서 태국계 영국 F1 레이싱 선수 알렉스 알본님을 만나뵈었는데요. 한국 음식을 소개해드리고 싶어서 언제 꼭 식사 대접하고 싶다고 말씀드렸죠. 참고로, 알렉스 님은 전 세계에서 20명에게만 주어지는 ' 포뮬러 원 드라이버' 라는 타이틀을 갖고 계실뿐만 아니라 그 중에서도 거의 탑급인 선수시죠. 토로 로쏘, 레드불 팀을 거쳐 현재는 윌리엄스 소속으로 뛰고 계신데요. 이번에 시즌 중에 잠깐 공백이 생긴 틈을 타, 특별히 저희를 위해 시간을 내주셔서 제가 가장 좋아하는 고깃집에 모시고 가서 식사하며 이야기를 나누게 되었답니다.\n\n저희에게 시간과 촬영에 협조해주신 알렉스 선수님과 팀에게 감사의 말씀을 전합니다!\n\n오늘 영상에 광고는 포함되어 있지 않지만, 지역 상인 여러분 늘 응원합니다!\n주소: Chung'dam London, 35-36 Greek St, London W1D 5DL"
