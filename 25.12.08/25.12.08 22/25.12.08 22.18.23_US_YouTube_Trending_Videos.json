            "description": "This is the teaser trailer for The Boys Season 5. It’s Homelander’s world, completely subject to his erratic, egomaniacal whims. Hughie, Mother’s Milk, and Frenchie are imprisoned in a “Freedom Camp.” Annie struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. Kimiko is nowhere to be found. But when Butcher reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it. It’s the climax, people. Big stuff’s gonna happen April 8 on Prime.\n\n» Watch The Boys on Prime Video: https://amzn.to/2SQdfsv\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n\nAbout The Boys:\nTHE BOYS is an irreverent take on what happens when superheroes, who are as popular as celebrities, as influential as politicians and as revered as Gods, abuse their superpowers rather than use them for good. It's the powerless against the super powerful as The Boys embark on a heroic quest to expose the truth about “The Seven,” and their formidable Vought backing.\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

Hughie, Mother’s Milk, and Frenchie are imprisoned in a “Freedom Camp.” Annie struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. Kimiko is nowhere to be found. But when Butcher reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it.

Milly Alcock: Supergirl de La Casa del Dragón, Jason Momoa: El Regreso de Lobo, las secuelas de la película de Superman, la cronología de la segunda temporada del Universo DC de Peacemaker, la cronología de Superman. El crossover de Superman 2: El Hombre del Mañana con Brainiac.\n\nAnuncio de Netflix y Warner Bros. Netflix anunció la compra de Warner Brothers. ¿Qué significa esto para James Gunn en futuras películas de DC, futuras series de televisión como Superman 2: El Hombre del Mañana, Linterna Verde, Batman: El Valiente y la Liga de la Justicia, la nueva película de La Liga de la Justicia y todo lo demás? La tercera temporada de La Casa del Dragón, la nueva serie de Harry Potter (2027). Qué está cambiando Netflix y qué no.\n\nRecientemente tuve la oportunidad de hablar personalmente con James Gunn. Me sorprendió que le gustaran mis videos de Emergency Awesome. Hablamos sobre el futuro del Universo DC, las próximas películas y series, desde los avances de Superman 2, El Hombre del Mañana, Linternas, la serie de los nuevos dioses Darkseid y Mr. Miracle, la Liga de la Justicia, Batman, The Flash y la película de Supergirl. ¡Había mucho! Incluso hablamos de Juego de Tronos y George R.R. Martin.\n\nFinal del episodio 8 de la temporada 2 de Peacemaker. Huevos de Pascua de Superman. La nueva Liga de la Justicia de James Gunn. Fortaleza de la Soledad, cameo de Bradley Cooper con Jor-El, robots Kelex, nuevas escenas. Nuevos cambios en Batman y explicación del plan de las películas de DC para Batman. Nuevas imágenes y escenas. Fortaleza de la Soledad. Superman vs. Ultraman, Superman malvado. Primer vistazo de Linterna Verde. Escena de Mr. Terrific con Krypto. Superman vs. Lex Luthor. Nuevo traje de Superman, explicación de Flash.\n\nMilly Alcock: Supergirl. Nueva Supergirl vs. versiones anteriores. Avance de Supergirl: La Mujer del Mañana. David Corenswet, Superman, Nicholas Hoult, Lex Luthor, cambios respecto a versiones anteriores de Lex Luthor como El Hombre de Acero, Batman v Superman y La Liga de la Justicia.\n\nEl próximo año se anunciarán los avances de Brave and the Bold y el Nuevo Batman. Nathan Fillion, Linterna Verde, Hawkgirl, Mr. Terrific y más personajes nuevos de la Liga de la Justicia. ¿Por qué La Nueva Liga de la Justicia se basa más en el Equipo Animado de la Liga de la Justicia?\n\n¡Muchos más tráilers de DC y Marvel! El tráiler de Avengers 5 Doomsday, el tráiler de Spider-Man: Un Nuevo Día. ¡Haré más videos de los tráilers de Superman 2: El Hombre del Mañana, Supergirl y Lanterns a medida que los publiquen!\n\nCanal de Twitch: https://twitch.tv/emergencyawesome\nTwitter: https://x.com/awesomemergency\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/emergencyawesome\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/emergencyawesome\nTumblr: https://robotchallenger.com\nMi sitio web: https://emergencyawesome.com\n\n:: Listas de reproducción de videos para programas::\n\nNuevos videos de Emergency Awesome: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxQXxyV_2D8kuEs_QsuQIyJ\nEpisodios de House of the Dragon: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxqJeNeCsF_ghizcTS9nM4X\nEpisodios de Loki: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczy8mUNqHU-35xtTd-JpJU3l\nEl Episodios de The Mandalorian https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzsN78nOjS-ABHwKaB7KONW\nEpisodios de Juego de Tronos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPOIeYdZ3QczxGuSDE8NtOuthqbKFChC0q\nPelículas de Marvel y ..."

Міллі Алкок: Супердівчина з «Дому Дракона», Джейсон Момоа: Повернення Лобо, наслідки фільму про Супермена, хронологія DCU 2 сезону «Миротворця», хронологія Супермена. Кросовер «Супермен 2: Людина Завтрашнього Дня» з Брейніаком.\n\nОголошення Netflix Warner Bros. Netflix оголосив про купівлю Warner Brothers. Що це означає для майбутніх фільмів DC з Джеймсом Ганном, майбутніх телешоу, таких як «Супермен 2: Людина Завтрашнього Дня», «Зелений Ліхтар», «Бетмен: Хоробрий та Сміливий», нового фільму «Ліга Справедливості» та всього іншого. «Дім Дракона», 3 сезон, нова серія про Гаррі Поттера 2027 року. Що змінює Netflix, а що не змінюється.\n\nНещодавно мені довелося особисто поговорити з Джеймсом Ганном. Я був здивований, що він був шанувальником моїх відео \"Надзвичайно круто\". Ми говорили про майбутнє DCU, майбутні фільми та телешоу, такі як тизери \"Супермена 2: Людини завтрашнього дня\", \"Ліхтарі\", \"Нові боги Дарксайда\" та \"Містер Міракл\", \"Ліга Справедливості\", \"Бетмен\", \"Флеш\" та фільм \"Супердівчина\". Було багато цікавого! Ми навіть говорили про \"Гру престолів\" та Джорджа Р. Р. Мартіна.\n\nКінець 8-ї серії 2 сезону \"Миротворця\". Пасхальні яйця Супермена. Нова Ліга Справедливості з Джеймсом Ганном. Фортеця Самотності, камео Бредлі Купера з Джор-Елом, роботи Kelex, нові сцени. Нові зміни Бетмена та пояснення плану фільмів DC щодо Бетмена. Нові кадри та сцени. Фортеця Самотності. Супермен проти Ультрамена, Злий Супермен. Перший погляд на Зелений Ліхтар. Сцена з Містером Чудовим Крипто. Супермен проти Лекса Лютора. Новий костюм Супермена, пояснення Флеша.\n\nСупердівчина Міллі Алкок. Нова Супердівчина проти попередніх версій. Тизер \"Супердівчина: Жінка завтрашнього дня\". Девід Коренсвет, Супермен, Ніколас Голт, Лекс Лютор, зміни порівняно з попередніми версіями Лекса Лютора, такі як Людина зі сталі, Бетмен проти Супермена, Ліга Справедливості.\n\nТизер до \"Хороброго та сміливого\" та \"Нового Бетмена\" будуть анонсовані наступного року. Натан Філліон, Зелений Ліхтар, Яструб-Дівчина, Містер Терріфік та інші нові персонажі Ліги Справедливості. Чому Нова Ліга Справедливості більше базується на анімованій команді Ліги Справедливості.\n\nБуде ще багато трейлерів DC та Marvel: трейлер \"Месників 5: Судний день\", трейлер \"Людини-павука: Новий день\" та я зніму ще відео з трейлерами до \"Супермена 2: Людина завтрашнього дня\", \"Супердівчина\" та \"Ліхтарі\", як тільки вони вийдуть!\n\nКанал Twitch https://twitch.tv/emergencyawesome\nTwitter https://x.com/awesomemergency\nFacebook https://facebook.com/emergencyawesome\nInstagram https://instagram.com/emergencyawesome\nTumblr https://robotchallenger.com\nМій веб-сайт https://emergencyawesome.com\n\n:: Відеоплейлисти для шоу ::\n\nНові приголомшливі відео про надзвичайні ситуації https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxQXxyV_2D8kuEs_QsuQIyJ\nЕпізоди «Дому Дракона» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxqJeNeCsF_ghizcTS9nM4X\nЕпізоди «Локі» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczy8mUNqHU-35xtTd-JpJU3l\nЕпізоди «Мандалорець» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzsN78nOjS-ABHwKaB7KONW\nЕпізоди «Гри престолів» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPOIeYdZ3QczxGuSDE8NtOuthqbKFChC0q\nФільми Marvel та «Месники» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwWT3yd94Xc6n-ooI85uV_u\nЕпізоди 5 сезону «Хлопці» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczw-KMQyuCrxcxV3mSQWTAdR\nВідео про Людину-павука https://www.youtube.com/playl..."

                "description": "#netflix #strangerthings5 #strangerthings\n\nDécouvrez le concept de bande-annonce (création de fan) pour Stranger Things - Saison 5 (2025) (Plus d'infos ci-dessous !)\n\n▶️ Plus de bandes-annonces conceptuelles :\n\nHarry Potter et l'Enfant Maudit - https://youtu.be/OnwogtoNJSA 👈\n\nLa Reine des Neiges : Bande-annonce du film en prises de vues réelles - https://youtu.be/5FlLO5EpNic 👈\n\nPirates des Caraïbes 6 - Bande-annonce - https://youtu.be/uncc9uN0bbI 👈\n\nPréparez-vous pour le final épique de la série culte de science-fiction et d'horreur de Netflix avec la bande-annonce de la saison 5 de Stranger Things. Prévue pour novembre 2025, cette ultime saison promet un dénouement palpitant à la saga Hawkins. Après des retards dus aux grèves du secteur, le tournage s'est achevé en décembre 2024 et la post-production est en avance sur le calendrier. Les frères Duffer ont concocté une saison ambitieuse, décrite comme « huit films à grand spectacle », axée sur la profondeur émotionnelle et une action intense.\n\nL'intrigue se concentre sur l'ultime bataille de l'équipe de Hawkins contre Vecna, explorant plus en profondeur les mystères de l'Upside Down. Attendez-vous à un retour aux sources de la série, mêlant la dynamique des débuts et une évolution significative des personnages, notamment le passage à l'âge adulte de Will. La saison explorera également la nature étrange et figée dans le temps de l'Upside Down, intégrant potentiellement un saut temporel pour refléter le vieillissement des personnages.\n\nLa distribution principale est de retour, avec notamment Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, David Harbour, Winona Ryder, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Brett Gelman, Cara Buono et Jamie Campbell Bower. De nouveaux talents, comme Linda Hamilton et Amybeth McNulty, rejoignent la troupe, apportant une nouvelle dimension à l'histoire. Les huit titres d'épisodes confirmés, dont « The Crawl », « The Vanishing of… » et « The Rightsside Up », laissent présager une saison riche en intrigues et en aventures. Ne manquez pas ce final explosif et empreint de nostalgie pour cette série culte.\n\nMontage, effets spéciaux, effets sonores et miniature par @GalacticTrailerOfficial\n\nAbonnez-vous :\n\n✅YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/c/GalacticTrailerOfficial\n✅Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/darthvideos/\n✅TikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@darthtrailer\n✅Twitter : https://twitter.com/Darth_Trailer\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLogiciels utilisés : Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Photoshop, Adobe Audition, Unreal Engine 5.4\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n◁ Sur notre chaîne, nous créons des mashups de bandes-annonces. ▷ Les mashups de bandes-annonces, aussi appelés bandes-annonces remaniées, sont réalisés en assemblant des extraits de films issus d’un ou plusieurs longs métrages et en les remontant pour créer une bande-annonce inédite. Ces mashups mettent souvent en scène un film imaginaire ou changent le genre d’un film existant. En tant qu'œuvres dérivées, telles que définies par la loi américaine sur le droit d'auteur (17 U.S.C. § 101), elles peuvent être protégées contre les réclamations pour atteinte au droit d'auteur en vertu de la doctrine de l'utilisation équitable (fair use).\n\nLes mashups de bandes-annonces ne sont pas seulement une forme de créativité numérique générée par les utilisateurs, mais aussi un moyen unique de susciter l'enthousiasme autour des sorties à venir, en complément des bandes-annonces officielles. Tandis que les bandes-annonces traditionnelles dévoilent l'intrigue et créent le buzz, les mashups réalisés par les fans permettent au public d'apporter sa propre touche cinématographique aux images existantes. Cette liberté créative peut mettre en avant un acteur en particulier, souligner une intrigue spécifique, ou même transformer complètement le genre du film.\n\nCette vidéo est une parodie. De par sa nature dérivée et transformative, elle est protégée par l'utilisation équitable (fair use).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- Merci beaucoup d'avoir regardé !\n\nPIKACHU, JE TE CHOISIS !"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

All You Need Is Kill will feature its original Japanese language with subtitles, and will open in theaters nationwide beginning January 16, 2026.\n\nSet in the year 20XX, ALL YOU NEED IS KILL follows the story of Rita, a resourceful but isolated young woman volunteering to help rebuild Japan after the mysterious appearance of a massive alien flower known as \"Darol.\" When Darol unexpectedly erupts in a deadly event, unleashing monstrous creatures that decimate the population, Rita is caught in the destruction—and killed. But then she wakes up again. And again. Caught in an endless time loop, Rita must navigate the trauma and repetition of death until she crosses paths with Keiji, a shy young man trapped in the same cycle. Together, they fight to break free from the loop and find meaning in the chaos around them.\n\nProduced by Warner Bros. Japan with animation production by acclaimed Japanese animation house STUDIO4°C (the upcoming ChaO, Tekkonkinkreet, Mind Game), the fan favorite animated action sci-fi drama is based on the globally best-selling light novel of the same name from author Hiroshi Sakurazaka. All You Need Is Kill is the feature directorial debut of Kenichiro Akimoto, with a script written by Yuichiro Kido.\n\n#IGN #AllYouNeedIsKill #Animation",

Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart is a gripping documentary feature that takes viewers inside the real story—told in Elizabeth’s own words and through exclusive interviews with her family, investigators, and those closest to the case. Blending archival footage and never-before-seen material, the film traces the harrowing nine months of Elizabeth’s captivity at the hands of Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee. It explores the psychological and emotional toll on Elizabeth and her family, the relentless media attention, and the community’s tireless search for answers.

                "description": "In the early hours of June 5, 2002, 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart was abducted from her bedroom in Salt Lake City, Utah, igniting one of the most intense and widely covered missing-person cases in American history. Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart is a gripping documentary feature that takes viewers inside the real story—told in Elizabeth’s own words and through exclusive interviews with her family, investigators, and those closest to the case. Blending archival footage and never-before-seen material, the film traces the harrowing nine months of Elizabeth’s captivity at the hands of Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee. It explores the psychological and emotional toll on Elizabeth and her family, the relentless media attention, and the community’s tireless search for answers. The documentary not only revisits the events that shocked a nation but also spotlights Elizabeth’s journey of healing and her ongoing mission to inspire and protect others.\n\nWatch on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/81744530\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with over 300 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

John Legend\n\n\n[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor]\nI found myself dreaming in silver and gold\nLike a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows\nWe were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close\nSplit second and you disappeared and then I was all alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Meghan Trainor]\nI woke up in tears, with you by my side\nA breath of relief, and I've realised\nNo, we're not promised tomorrow\n\n[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\nI'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standin', I won't take you for granted\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)\nI'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\n[Verse 2: John Legend, Meghan Trainor]\nIn the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke\nYou could lose everything, the truth is you never know\nSo I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey), any chance that I get\nI'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret\n\n[Pre-Chorus: John Legend, Meghan Trainor, Both]\nLet's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want)\nUse what we got before it's all gone (All gone)\n'Cause no (No), we're not promised tomorrow\n\n[Chorus: Meghan Trainor, John Legend, Both]\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)\nI'm gonna hold you (Hey), like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standin' (Yeah), I won't take you for granted\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you), like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)\nI'm gonna love you (Love you), like I'm gonna lose you (Hey)\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus: Meghan Trainor, John Legend, Both]\nI'm gonna love you (Oh) like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)\nI'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standin', I won't take you for granted\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\nSo I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you, baby) like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)\nI'm gonna love you (Oh) like I'm gonna lose you\n\nContact us here: LatinNowYT@gmail.com\n\n#meghantrainor  #johnlegend  #likeimgonnaloseyou #latinlyrics  #music",

Siete tutti bellissimi e apprezzo davvero ognuno di voi per averci accompagnato in questo folle viaggio. Auguratemi buona fortuna e ci vediamo alla prossima! Andiamo in guerra!\n\nUnisciti al mio Discord per passare del tempo con me e la nostra community! Organizziamo anche un sacco di omaggi: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nBrettski ha fatto irruzione al Celestial Crown Casino con il tipo di energia che faceva irrigidire i croupier e sussurrare i direttori di sala nelle radio. Di solito era un giocatore docile, uno che punta 50 dollari qui, 100 dollari là, il tipo che trattava il casinò come un hobby bizzarro piuttosto che come un campo di battaglia. Ma non stasera. Stasera, Brettski era un uomo posseduto.\n\nMarciò dritto verso la sala con puntate alte, un posto che aveva sempre superato solo con riverenza, come un museo separato dai mortali. Ora ne varcò la tenda di velluto con una sicurezza che non gli apparteneva. In tasca aveva 10.000 dollari: tutti i suoi risparmi, il fondo di emergenza e la sua sanità mentale, tutti concentrati in un unico, sconsiderato malloppo.\n\nScelse un tavolo da baccarat illuminato da calde luci dorate. \"Diecimila\", disse, con voce ferma nonostante il caos che gli turbinava dentro. La croupier sbatté le palpebre due volte, incerta di aver sentito bene. Brettski annuì. \"Tutti.\"\n\nLe carte schioccarono. La tensione si fece sentire.\n\nGiocatore: 4.\nBanco: 9.\n\nBrettski deglutì. Il suo polso martellava. Poi la mano della croupier si sollevò: un'altra carta per il Giocatore.\n\nUn 5.\nGiocatore: 9.\n\nUn pareggio.\n\nSbuffi di gioia. Brettski sentì l'universo fermarsi, inspirare, riconsiderare.\n\nMano successiva: un altro push.\nPoi: un altro pareggio.\n\nLa probabilità si piegò su di lui come un errore nella realtà.\n\nAl sesto pareggio, si era radunata una folla. I direttori di sala si chinarono. Qualcuno registrò. Il tavolo sembrava caricato elettricamente, come se il casinò stesso si stesse svegliando.\n\n\"Mano successiva\", sussurrò Brettski, spingendo di nuovo in avanti tutta la sua puntata. Le sue mani tremavano. Il croupier distribuiva lentamente, quasi con riverenza.\n\nGiocatore: 0.\nBanco: 0.\n\nIl tavolo esplose: due carte naturali in attesa di essere distribuite.\n\nMa prima che il croupier pescasse la carta successiva, tutti gli schermi del casinò divennero neri. Poi un unico messaggio apparve su tutti contemporaneamente:\n\nBRETTSKI, STOP. NON SONO I TUOI SOLDI.\n\nE dietro di lui, qualcuno gli mise una mano sulla spalla.\n\n#slot #blackjack #gioco d'azzardo #casinò #baccarat #roulette\n\nChi è Brettski? Brettski è un giocatore d'azzardo professionista, simile alle antiche leggende Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot o Lady Luck HQ! Tuttavia, a differenza di queste leggende, Brettski ha migliaia di anni di conoscenze antiche, accumulate dagli anziani, su abilità come slot machine, roulette, blackjack, dadi, bubble craps, poker e baccarat. L'obiettivo di Brettski come giocatore d'azzardo professionista è semplice: conquistare tutta Las Vegas, utilizzando i fondi guadagnati con il gioco d'azzardo.

Esta noite, Brettski estava possuído.\n\nEle marchou direto para a sala de apostas altas, um lugar pelo qual sempre passara com reverência, como um museu isolado dos mortais. Agora, ele atravessou a cortina de veludo com uma confiança que não lhe pertencia. No bolso, havia 10 mil dólares — todas as suas economias, fundo de emergência e sanidade, tudo num pacote imprudente.\n\nEle escolheu uma mesa de bacará iluminada por luzes douradas e quentes. \"Dez mil\", disse ele, com a voz firme apesar do caos que o consumia por dentro. A crupiê piscou duas vezes, incerta se ouvira direito. Brettski assentiu. \"Tudo.\"\n\nAs cartas foram distribuídas. A tensão aumentou no ar.\n\nJogador: 4.\nBanqueiro: 9.\n\nBrettski engoliu em seco. Seu pulso acelerou. Então, a mão da crupiê pairou — mais uma carta para o Jogador.\n\nUm 5.\nJogador: 9.\n\nEmpate.\n\nSuspiros de espanto ecoaram.

O crupiê distribuiu as cartas lentamente, quase reverentemente.\n\nJogador: 0.\nBanqueiro: 0.\n\nA mesa explodiu — dois naturais prestes a acontecer.\n\nMas antes que o crupiê puxasse a próxima carta, todas as telas do cassino piscaram e ficaram pretas. Então, uma única mensagem apareceu em todas elas ao mesmo tempo:\n\nBRETTSKI, PARE.

Зазвичай він був стриманим гравцем — хлопцем на $50 тут, $100 там, тим, хто ставився до казино як до дивного хобі, а не як до поля бою. Але не сьогодні ввечері. Сьогодні ввечері Бреттскі був одержимим.\n\nВін попрямував прямо до кімнати з високими лімітами, місця, повз яке він завжди проходив лише з благоговінням, немов музей, відгороджений від смертних. Тепер він проштовхнувся крізь її оксамитову завісу з впевненістю, яка йому не належала. У кишені лежало 10 000 доларів — усі його заощадження, резервний фонд і здоровий глузд, зібрані в один безрозсудний пакунок.\n\nВін обрав стіл для баккара, що світився під теплим золотим світлом. «Десять тисяч», — сказав він рівним голосом, незважаючи на хаос, що вирував усередині нього. Дилер двічі кліпнула, не впевнена, чи правильно почула. Бретскі кивнув. «Все».\n\nКарти випали. Напруга стиснула повітря.\n\nГравець: 4.\nБанкір: 9.\n\nБретскі ковтнув. Його пульс завмер. Потім рука дилера зависла — ще одна карта для Гравця.\n\n5.\nГравець: 9.\n\nНічия.\n\nПрокотилися хвилі. Бретскі відчув, як всесвіт зупинився, вдихнув, передумав.\n\nНаступна роздача: ще один поштовх.\nДалі: ще одна нічия.\n\nЙмовірність зігнулася навколо нього, як глюк у реальності.\n\nДо шостої нічиєї зібрався натовп. Керівники піт-босів нахилилися. Хтось записав. Стіл відчував себе наелектризованим, ніби саме казино прокидалося.\n\n«Наступна роздача», — прошепотів Бретцкі, знову просуваючи всю свою ставку вперед.

Vous êtes géniaux, et je vous remercie infiniment de m’avoir accompagné dans cette aventure dingue. Souhaitez-moi bonne chance, et on se retrouve pour la prochaine vidéo ! Que la guerre commence !\n\nRejoignez mon serveur Discord pour discuter avec moi et notre communauté ! On organise aussi plein de concours : https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nBrettski a fait irruption au Celestial Crown Casino avec une énergie telle qu’elle a glacé le sang des croupiers et fait chuchoter les chefs de table dans leurs radios. D’habitude, c’était un joueur tranquille : 50 $ par-ci, 100 $ par-là, le genre de joueur qui considérait le casino comme un passe-temps original plutôt que comme un champ de bataille. Mais pas ce soir. Ce soir, Brettski était possédé.\n\nIl se dirigea droit vers la salle des mises élevées, un endroit qu'il n'avait jamais fait qu'effleurer avec déférence, comme un musée interdit aux mortels. À présent, il franchit le rideau de velours avec une assurance qui ne lui était pas naturelle. Dans sa poche, 10 000 dollars : toutes ses économies, son fonds d'urgence et sa raison réunis en un seul liasse inconsidérée.\n\nIl choisit une table de baccarat baignée d'une douce lumière dorée. « Dix mille », dit-il d'une voix calme malgré le chaos qui l'habitait. La croupière cligna des yeux à deux reprises, incertaine d'avoir bien entendu. Brettski acquiesça. « Tout. »\n\nLes cartes claquèrent. La tension monta d'un cran.\n\nJoueur : 4.\nBanquier : 9.\n\nBrettski déglutit. Son pouls s'accéléra. Puis la main de la croupière resta suspendue : une dernière carte pour le Joueur.\n\nUn 5.\n\nJoueur : 9.\n\nÉgalité.\n\nDes murmures d'étonnement parcoururent l'assistance. Brettski sentit l'univers s'arrêter, reprendre son souffle, réfléchir.\n\nMain suivante : égalité.\n\nMain suivante : égalité.\n\nLa probabilité semblait se plier à ses désirs comme un dysfonctionnement de la réalité.\n\nAu sixième match nul, une foule s'était rassemblée. Les chefs de table se penchèrent vers lui. Quelqu'un filmait. La table semblait électrisée, comme si le casino lui-même s'éveillait.\n\n« Main suivante », murmura Brettski en misant à nouveau tout son argent. Ses mains tremblaient. Le croupier distribua lentement, presque avec déférence.\n\nJoueur : 0.\n\nBanquier : 0.\n\nLa table explosa de joie – deux mains naturelles étaient en passe de se former.\n\nMais avant que le croupier ne tire la carte suivante, tous les écrans du casino devinrent noirs. Puis un message apparut simultanément sur tous :\n\nBRETTSKI, ARRÊTEZ. CE N'EST PAS VOTRE ARGENT.\n\nEt derrière lui, quelqu'un posa une main sur son épaule.\n\n#machinesàsous #blackjack #jeuxdargent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ? Brettski est un joueur professionnel, à l’instar des légendes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot ou Lady Luck HQ !

You’re all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nJoin my Discord to hang out with me and our community! We also run a bunch of giveaways: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nBrettski stormed into the Celestial Crown Casino with the kind of energy that made dealers stiffen and pit bosses whisper into radios. Normally he was a tame gambler—a $50 here, $100 there guy, the type who treated the casino like a quirky hobby rather than a battlefield. But not tonight. Tonight, Brettski was a man possessed.\n\nHe marched straight toward the high-limit room, a place he’d only ever passed by with reverence, like a museum roped off from mortals. Now he pushed through its velvet curtain with a confidence that didn’t belong to him. In his pocket sat $10,000—his entire savings, emergency fund, and sanity rolled into a single reckless bundle.\n\nHe chose a baccarat table glowing under warm golden lights. “Ten thousand,” he said, voice steady despite the chaos swirling inside him. The dealer blinked twice, unsure if she’d heard correctly. Brettski nodded. “All of it.”\n\nCards snapped out. Tension tightened the air.\n\nPlayer: 4.\nBanker: 9.\n\nBrettski swallowed. His pulse hammered. Then the dealer’s hand hovered—one more card for the Player.\n\nA 5.\nPlayer: 9.\n\nA tie.\n\nGasps rippled. Brettski felt the universe pause, inhale, reconsider.\n\nNext hand: another push.\nNext: another tie.\n\nProbability bent itself around him like a glitch in reality.\n\nBy the sixth tie, a crowd had gathered. Pit bosses leaned in. Someone recorded. The table felt electrically charged, like the casino itself was waking up.\n\n“Next hand,” Brettski whispered, pushing his entire bet forward again. His hands trembled. The dealer dealt slowly, almost reverently.\n\nPlayer: 0.\nBanker: 0.\n\nThe table erupted—two naturals waiting to happen.\n\nBut before the dealer drew the next card, every screen in the casino flickered to black. Then a single message appeared on all of them at once:\n\nBRETTSKI, STOP. THIS ISN’T YOUR MONEY.\n\nAnd behind him, someone placed a hand on his shoulder.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.

Dziś Brettski był jak opętany.\n\nRuszył prosto w stronę sali z wysokimi stawkami, miejsca, które do tej pory omijał z szacunkiem, niczym muzeum odgrodzone linami od śmiertelników. Teraz przecisnął się przez aksamitną kurtynę z pewnością siebie, która do niego nie należała. W kieszeni miał 10 000 dolarów – wszystkie oszczędności, fundusz awaryjny i zdrowy rozsądek zamknięte w jednym, lekkomyślnym pakunku.\n\nWybrał stół do bakarata, rozświetlony ciepłym, złotym światłem. „Dziesięć tysięcy” – powiedział spokojnym głosem, mimo panującego w nim chaosu. Krupierka zamrugała dwa razy, niepewna, czy dobrze usłyszała. Brettski skinęła głową. „Całość”.\n\nKarty wypadły z rąk. Atmosfera napięła się.\n\nGracz: 4.\nBankier: 9.\n\nBrettski przełknął ślinę.

Szefowie sali pochylili się. Ktoś to nagrał. Stół wydawał się naelektryzowany, jakby samo kasyno się budziło.\n\n„Następna ręka” – wyszeptał Brettski, ponownie podnosząc cały swój zakład. Jego ręce drżały. Krupier rozdawał powoli, niemal z nabożnym szacunkiem.\n\nGracz: 0.\nBankier: 0.\n\nStół eksplodował – dwa naturalne układy czekały na swój moment.\n\nAle zanim krupier dobrał kolejną kartę, wszystkie ekrany w kasynie zamigotały i zrobiły się czarne.

Wir veranstalten auch regelmäßig Gewinnspiele: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nBrettski stürmte mit einer Energie ins Celestial Crown Casino, die die Dealer erzittern und die Pit-Bosse in ihre Funkgeräte flüstern ließ. Normalerweise war er ein eher harmloser Spieler – mal 50 Dollar hier, mal 100 Dollar da, einer, der das Casino eher als ein skurriles Hobby denn als Schlachtfeld betrachtete. Aber nicht heute Abend. Heute Abend war Brettski wie besessen.\n\n\nEr marschierte schnurstracks auf den High-Limit-Raum zu, einen Ort, an dem er bisher immer nur ehrfürchtig vorbeigegangen war, wie ein Museum, das den Sterblichen verschlossen war. Jetzt durchbrach er den Samtvorhang mit einer ihm fremden Zuversicht. In seiner Tasche steckten 10.000 Dollar – seine gesamten Ersparnisse, sein Notfallfonds und sein Verstand, vereint in einem einzigen leichtsinnigen Bündel.\n\nEr wählte einen Baccarat-Tisch, der in warmem Goldlicht erstrahlte. „Zehntausend“, sagte er mit ruhiger Stimme, trotz des Chaos in seinem Inneren. Die Dealerin blinzelte zweimal, unsicher, ob sie richtig gehört hatte. Brettski nickte. „Alles.“\n\nKarten wurden aufgedeckt. Die Spannung war zum Greifen nah.\n\nSpieler: 4.\nBank: 9.\n\nBrettski schluckte. Sein Puls raste. Dann verharrte die Hand der Dealerin – noch eine Karte für den Spieler.\n\nEine 5.\n\nSpieler: 9.\n\nUnentschieden.\n\nEin Raunen ging durch die Menge. Brettski spürte, wie das Universum inne hielt, tief durchatmete und die Situation neu überdachte.\n\nNächste Hand: Wieder ein Unentschieden.\n\nNächste: Wieder ein Gleichstand.\n\nDie Wahrscheinlichkeit schien sich um ihn herum zu verzerren wie ein Fehler in der Realität.\n\nBeim sechsten Gleichstand hatte sich eine Menschenmenge versammelt. Pit-Bosse beugten sich vor. Jemand filmte. Der Tisch schien elektrisch geladen, als würde das Casino selbst erwachen.\n\n„Nächste Hand“, flüsterte Brettski und schob seinen gesamten Einsatz erneut nach vorn. Seine Hände zitterten. Der Dealer teilte langsam, fast andächtig, aus.\n\nSpieler: 0.\nBanker: 0.\n\nDer Tisch explodierte – zwei Naturals warteten nur darauf, eingebracht zu werden.\n\nDoch bevor der Dealer die nächste Karte zog, flackerten alle Bildschirme im Casino schwarz auf. Dann erschien gleichzeitig auf allen eine einzige Nachricht:\n\nBRETTSKI, STOPP. DAS IST NICHT DEIN GELD.\n\nUnd hinter ihm legte ihm jemand die Hand auf die Schulter.\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski? Brettski ist ein professioneller Spieler, vergleichbar mit den alten Legenden Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot oder Lady Luck HQ! Doch im Gegensatz zu diesen Legenden verfügt Brettski über Jahrtausende altes Wissen, das von den Ältesten überliefert wurde, und beherrscht Fähigkeiten wie Spielautomaten, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker und Baccarat.

También organizamos un montón de sorteos: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nBrettski irrumpió en el Casino Celestial Crown con la energía que hacía que los crupieres se pusieran rígidos y los jefes de sala susurraran por radio. Normalmente era un jugador tranquilo, de $50 por aquí, $100 por allá, de esos que tratan el casino como un pasatiempo peculiar en lugar de un campo de batalla. Pero esta noche no. Esta noche, Brettski estaba poseído.\n\nSe dirigió directamente a la sala de apuestas altas, un lugar por el que solo había pasado con reverencia, como un museo aislado de los mortales. Ahora atravesaba la cortina de terciopelo con una confianza que no le pertenecía. En su bolsillo había 10.000 dólares: todos sus ahorros, su fondo de emergencia y su cordura, reunidos en un único y temerario fajo.\n\nEligió una mesa de bacará que brillaba bajo cálidas luces doradas. \"Diez mil\", dijo con voz firme a pesar del caos que se arremolinaba en su interior. La crupier parpadeó dos veces, sin saber si había oído bien. Brettski asintió. \"Todo\".\n\nLas cartas salieron disparadas. La tensión se apoderó del aire.\n\nJugador: 4.\nBanquero: 9.\n\nBrettski tragó saliva. Su pulso latía con fuerza. Entonces la mano de la crupier se cernió sobre él: una carta más para el Jugador.\n\nUn 5.\nJugador: 9.\n\nEmpate.\n\nSe oyeron jadeos. Brettski sintió que el universo se detenía, respiraba hondo, reconsideraba.\n\nSiguiente mano: otro empate.\nSiguiente: otro empate.\n\nLa probabilidad se cernía sobre él como un fallo en la realidad.\n\nPara el sexto empate, se había congregado una multitud. Los jefes de mesa se acercaron. Alguien grabó. La mesa se sentía cargada de electricidad, como si el casino mismo estuviera despertando.\n\n\"Siguiente mano\", susurró Brettski, apostando de nuevo toda su apuesta. Le temblaban las manos. El crupier repartía despacio, casi con reverencia.\n\nJugador: 0.\nBanca: 0.\n\nLa mesa estalló: dos naturales a punto de suceder.\n\nPero antes de que el crupier sacara la siguiente carta, todas las pantallas del casino se oscurecieron. Entonces, un solo mensaje apareció en todas a la vez:\n\nBRETTSKI, ALTO. ESTE NO ES TU DINERO.\n\nY detrás de él, alguien le puso una mano en el hombro.\n\n#tragamonedas #blackjack #juegos #casino #bacará #ruleta\n\n¿Quién es Brettski? Brettski es un jugador profesional, similar a las antiguas leyendas Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot o Lady Luck HQ.

Затем рука дилера зависла — ещё одна карта для Игрока.\n\nПять.\n\nИгрок: 9.\n\nНичья.\n\nПослышались вздохи. Бреттски почувствовал, как вселенная замерла, вдохнула, переосмыслила.\n\nСледующая раздача: ещё один рывок.\nСледующая: ещё одна ничья.\n\nВероятность обвилась вокруг него, словно глюк в реальности.\n\nК шестой ничьей собралась толпа. Пит-боссы наклонились. Кто-то записал. Стол словно наэлектризовался, словно само казино просыпалось.\n\n«Следующая раздача», — прошептал Бреттски, снова выдвигая всю свою ставку вперёд. Руки его дрожали. Дилер раздавал медленно, почти благоговейно.\n\nИгрок: 0.\nБанкир: 0.\n\nСтол взорвался — два натурала ждали своего часа.\n\nНо прежде чем дилер взял следующую карту, все экраны в казино погасли. Затем на всех экранах одновременно появилось одно сообщение:\n\nБРЕТТСКИ, СТОП. ЭТО НЕ ТВОИ ДЕНЬГИ.\n\nИ позади него кто-то положил руку ему на плечо.\n\n#слоты #блэкджек #азартные игры #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nКто такой Бреттски? Бреттски — профессиональный игрок, похожий на легендарных Вегас Мэтта, Блаффа, ДегенДальта, TheBigJackpot или Lady Luck HQ! Однако, в отличие от этих легенд, Бреттски обладает тысячелетними знаниями, накопленными старейшинами, в таких областях, как игровые автоматы, рулетка, блэкджек, крэпс, бабл-крэпс, покер и баккара. Цель Бреттски как профессионального игрока проста: завладеть всем Лас-Вегасом, используя средства, заработанные азартными играми. Подпишитесь, чтобы поддержать его стремление к мировому господству."

The census will include employment status, employment industry, income level, age, and overall health, and the goal of the video will be to gather enough data about the people living here to do a demographic comparison between Valentine (fiction town from 1907) to real census and demographic data from 1907 frontier America.\n\nA lot of the video will be spent trying, with various degrees of success, to come up with a methodology for surveying a bunch of video game characters that can't talk, and aren't even persistent, so there will be a bit of discussion about sampling methods used by real scientists, and we'll demonstrate those methods using Valentine.\n\npatreon- https://www.patreon.com/any_austin\nbsky- https://bsky.app/profile/anyaustin.bsky.social\ndiscord- https://discord.gg/0wLFXHCpjmnrwCvJ\ninstagram- https://www.instagram.com/any_austin/\ntwitch- https://www.twitch.tv/any_austin\nTikTok- https://tiktok.com/@any_austin\n\nFor my music, search “The Excellent Man from Minneapolis” on your favorite streaming service, or click here for Spotify- https://open.spotify.com/artist/49RPyTk0BluLrg3scWFCOw\n\nEnglish, French, and German captions provided by Lawrence."

Every rank up, we gain a card. Which of the two of us will reach MASTER RANK first? We'll have to find out.\n\nThanks as always for the support.

Se espera que algunas propiedades de lujo cuesten alrededor de 20 millones de dólares. Además, parece que Rockstar Games no permitirá a los jugadores precargar ni descargar la nueva actualización con antelación en consolas, lo cual es un cambio sorprendente con respecto a los anteriores lanzamientos de DLC.

Крім того, схоже, що Rockstar Games не дозволить гравцям попередньо завантажувати або завантажувати нове оновлення на консолях, що є дивовижною зміною порівняно з попередніми релізами DLC.
