            "description": "Jeremy Allen White is Bruce Springsteen in the new trailer for Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere. In theaters October 24.\n\n\nFrom 20th Century Studios, “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” chronicles the making of Bruce Springsteen’s 1982 “Nebraska” album when he was a young musician on the cusp of global superstardom, struggling to reconcile the pressures of success with the ghosts of his past. Recorded on a 4-track recorder in Springsteen’s New Jersey bedroom, the album marked a pivotal time in his life and is considered one of his most enduring works—a raw, haunted acoustic record populated by lost souls searching for a reason to believe.\n\nStarring Jeremy Allen White as the Boss, the film is Written for the Screen and Directed by Scott Cooper based on the book “Deliver Me from Nowhere” by Warren Zanes.  “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” also features Jeremy Strong as Springsteen’s long-time confidant and manager, Jon Landau; Paul Walter Hauser as guitar tech Mike Batlan; Stephen Graham as Springsteen’s father, Doug, Odessa Young as love interest, Faye; Gaby Hoffman as Springsteen’s mom, Adele; Marc Maron as Chuck Plotkin and David Krumholtz as Columbia executive, Al Teller. Arriving only in theaters October 24, 2025, the film is produced by Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson and Scott Stuber. Tracey Landon Jon Vein, and Zanes executive produce.",

Well, it wasn’t all bad\nOne night stands looping, they feel good? Don’t know what that’s like\nComfortably affluent, and that important part, my heartbeat, dropped it somewhere, oops\nThose days, in a word is, I’m just me, no right or wrong to it\nBut honestly it was all fun, him and him, all of them kind\nThe only thing annoying was the occasional, I love you’s\nYOLO! That kind of energy doesn’t exist here\nLife saving caresses that let life go on, that’s all I wanted\nThis here, whose kid is this? What is this punishment\nThe warmth that I searched for, is this the answer?\nI’m sick, quick, leave me alone\nMy body sways, and I fall down into a dream\n\nLIFE, it can’t be ok that I’m the one who survived\nLIFE, I thought only of me, and aborted you, so why\n“Indecent” and “careless”, but still you judge “innocent” with a shrug?\nI have much more that needs fixing, so why\nLIFE, I wanted you to care enough to scold me and tell me I was wrong\n\nDamn you\n\n\nSomeone smoking a cigarette, I didn’t dislike it\nI think it was menthols, it freshened up the smog\nBreath in, breath out, and repeat, everything to ash\nIt was like looking at the mirror, that was a bit rough\nKaraoke, midnight drives, templated meet-ups\nAll foreplay to lust, and beyond that, sex\n“WARNING, do not mix”, let’s keep love and lust separate, ok?\nIt’s only fun where you can stand, you drown once you go out to sea\nFeelings like love, they always felt ick\nCuz the moment you have it, it changes on you, no?\nKeeping a safe distance, let’s just stay the same\nFor everyone’s sake, but mostly for me\nWe’ll probably be strangers tomorrow, please, I really hate it when you insist\nThe more I say, the more I wonder, who am I?\nDawn’s coming, the dream’s cooling\n\nLIFE, I wish I could have gone with you too\nLIFE, I was just freaked out about becoming a mom, so why\nDon’t forgive me don’t forgive me don’t forgive me don’t forgive me\nThink about those who should have lived instead of me, so why\nLIFE, I wanted you to care enough to Tear and Drop me\n\nLIFE\n\nLet me just say this\nDear Mahiru, I’m sorry for all the pain, for all the upset\nI couldn’t do anything to help, I’m sorry\nIf one day, by accident or chance we meet again\nLet’s catch up, and let me meet your lovely boyfriend too\n\n©MILGRAM"

Get tickets now.\n-----\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@jurassicworld\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jurassicworld\nX: https://twitter.com/jurassicworld\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jurassicworld\nOfficial Site: https://www.jurassicworld.com/\n\nA new era is born. This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

            "description": "A marcher critically wounded in a shooting at Salt Lake City’s 10,000-strong “No Kings” protest on Saturday night has died, police reported Sunday afternoon.\n\n“Our victim was not the intended target,” Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said, “but rather an innocent bystander participating in the demonstration”\n\nRedd said the 39-year-old man, whose name he declined to release, was shot by one of two individuals in neon vests who intervened when they saw a person raise a gun and run toward the crowd.\n\nOne of those men fired on that armed man, whom police called a suspect. These men in vests may have been part of the “events peacekeeping team,” Redd said.\n\nPolice did not arrest or detain those men, and Redd said the shooter is cooperating with police.\n\nRead more here: https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/15/marcher-wounded-no-kings-protest\n\nVideo by Chris Samuels of The Salt Lake Tribune.",

En welkom bij de 7-Eleven-vangst van mijn dromen!! Tijdens onze eerdere reizen naar Oost-Azië merkten we zeker de populariteit van 7-Elevens, die we vrijwel overal zagen. We waren niet alleen verrast door hoe wijdverspreid en populair ze waren, we realiseerden ons ook al snel dat ze een heleboel geweldige dingen hadden die we in de Verenigde Staten niet hebben - zoals bao's, thee, sando's, noedels, ijskoffie, unieke smaken chips, pannenkoekensandwiches, maïsijs ​​- en meer! En toen we terugkwamen, begon ik te merken hoeveel mensen online ook naar internationale 7-Elevens gingen en snacks kochten - en ik besefte: dit is een trend in gemakswinkels!\n\nDus tijdens onze reizen van het afgelopen jaar hebben we 7-Eleven-tours en -hauls verzameld in elk land dat we bezochten - Singapore, Maleisië en Japan... om wat virale snacks uit te proberen en ze in het algemeen te vergelijken, maar vooral ook gewoon om te smullen!

En nuestros viajes anteriores al este de Asia, notamos la prevalencia de los 7-Elevens en casi todas partes. No solo nos sorprendió su popularidad, sino que enseguida nos dimos cuenta de que tenían un montón de cosas increíbles que no tenemos en Estados Unidos, como baos, tés, sándwiches, fideos, café helado, sabores únicos de papas fritas, sándwiches de panqueques, helado de maíz, ¡y mucho más! Y al regresar, empecé a notar cuánta gente en línea también iba a 7-Elevens internacionales y compraba comida, ¡y me di cuenta de que esto es un movimiento de tiendas de conveniencia!\n\nAsí que, durante nuestros viajes del último año, recopilamos tours y compras de 7-Elevens en cada país que visitamos: Singapur, Malasia y Japón… para probar algunos snacks virales y compararlos, ¡pero también para darnos un festín! ¿Qué 7-Eleven de qué país deberíamos visitar próximamente?\n\nMi Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMi TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nCanal de Tyler: https://www.youtube.com/@tylerwilliams\nNuestro canal de YouTube Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/@safiyashorts\n\n¡Descubre nuestra tienda de merchandising aquí! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nProductores ejecutivos: Safiya Nygaard y Tyler Williams\nProductora ejecutiva: Lona Smith\nProductora asociada: Ishara Mathews\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Malcolm McLean\nEditora junior: Leslie Alcantar\nEditor asistente: Max Winiarski\nDiseñadora gráfica: Dayana Espinoza\n\nMÚSICA\nVía AudioNetwork\n\n00:00 Introducción\n03:32 7-Eleven de Singapur (y 7-Café)\n07:01 Prueba de sabor del 7-Eleven de Singapur\n11:10 El 7-Eleven más grande de Malasia\n16:00 Prueba de sabor del 7-Eleven de Malasia\n19:29 El gran 7-Eleven japonés\n23:49 Prueba de sabor del 7-Eleven de Japón\n27:57 Clasificación final\n\n#vlog #comida #foodie #snacks #7eleven"

And welcome to the 7-Eleven haul of my dreams!! Now, on our previous trips to East Asia, we definitely noticed the prevalence of 7-Elevens pretty much everywhere - and not only were we surprised by how widespread and popular they were - we quickly realized, they had a lot of pretty awesome stuff we don’t have in the states - like, baos, teas, sandos, noodles, iced coffees, unique chip flavors, pancake sandwiches, corn ice cream - and more!! And once we returned - I started to notice how many people online were also going to international 7-Elevens and doing snack hauls - and I realized - this is a convenience store movement!! \n\nSo on our travels over the past year, we’ve collected 7-Eleven tours and hauls in each country we visited - Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan… to try out some viral snacks, and generally compare them, but also mostly just to feast!

Und willkommen zu meinem Traum-7-Eleven-Einkauf! Auf unseren früheren Reisen nach Ostasien fiel uns die flächendeckende Präsenz von 7-Eleven-Läden auf – und wir waren nicht nur überrascht, wie weit verbreitet und beliebt sie waren, sondern merkten auch schnell, dass sie viele tolle Sachen hatten, die es in den USA nicht gibt – wie Baos, Tees, Sandos, Nudeln, Eiskaffee, einzigartige Chipssorten, Pfannkuchensandwiches, Maiseis – und vieles mehr! Nach unserer Rückkehr fiel mir auf, wie viele Leute online auch internationale 7-Eleven-Läden besuchten und Snacks kauften – und mir wurde klar: Das ist eine Convenience-Store-Bewegung!\n\nAlso haben wir auf unseren Reisen im letzten Jahr 7-Eleven-Touren und -Besuche in jedem unserer Länder – Singapur, Malaysia und Japan – gesammelt, um ein paar beliebte Snacks zu probieren und zu vergleichen, aber vor allem auch einfach nur, um zu schlemmen!

E benvenuti al bottino da 7-Eleven dei miei sogni!! Ora, nei nostri precedenti viaggi in Asia orientale, abbiamo sicuramente notato la presenza di 7-Eleven praticamente ovunque, e non solo siamo rimasti sorpresi dalla loro diffusione e popolarità, ma ci siamo subito resi conto che avevano un sacco di cose fantastiche che non abbiamo negli Stati Uniti, come bao, tè, sando, noodles, caffè freddo, patatine dai gusti unici, panini con pancake, gelato al mais e molto altro! E una volta tornati, ho iniziato a notare quante persone online andavano anche nei 7-Eleven internazionali e facevano haul di snack, e ho capito: questo è un movimento di minimarket!\n\nCosì, nei nostri viaggi dell'ultimo anno, abbiamo raccolto tour e haul di 7-Eleven in ogni paese che abbiamo visitato: Singapore, Malesia e Giappone... per provare alcuni snack virali e, in generale, confrontarli, ma anche e soprattutto per fare un piccolo assaggio!

A kiedy wróciliśmy - zacząłem zauważać, jak wiele osób online również chodzi do międzynarodowych 7-Eleven i robi zakupy przekąsek - i zdałem sobie sprawę - to ruch sklepów spożywczych!! \n\nWięc podczas naszych podróży w ciągu ostatniego roku zebraliśmy wycieczki i zakupy 7-Eleven w każdym kraju, który odwiedziliśmy - Singapurze, Malezji i Japonii... aby wypróbować kilka wirusowych przekąsek i ogólnie je porównać, ale także głównie po prostu po to, aby ucztować! 7-Eleven w którym kraju powinniśmy odwiedzić następnym razem? \n\nMój Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMój TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nKanał Tylera: https://www.youtube.com/@tylerwilliams \nNasz kanał YouTube Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/@safiyashorts\n\nSprawdź nasz sklep z gadżetami tutaj!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nProducenci wykonawczy: Safiya Nygaard i Tyler Williams\nProducent zarządzający: Lona Smith\nProducent pomocniczy: Ishara Mathews\nRedaktor: Andrew Lainhart\nRedaktor: Malcolm McLean\nMłodszy redaktor: Leslie Alcantar\nAsystent redaktora: Max Winiarski\nProjektant graficzny: Dayana Espinoza\n\nMUZYKA\nZa pośrednictwem AudioNetwork\n\n00:00 Intro\n03:32 Singapurski 7-Eleven (& 7-Cafe)\n07:01 Singapurski test smakowy 7-Eleven\n11:10 Największy 7-Eleven w Malezji\n16:00 Malezyjski test smakowy 7-Eleven\n19:29 The Big Daddy: Japoński 7-Eleven\n23:49 Japoński test smakowy 7-Eleven\n27:57 Finał Rankingi\n\n#vlog #jedzenie #smakosz #przekąski #7eleven"

E bem-vindos à compra dos meus sonhos na 7-Eleven!! Em nossas viagens anteriores ao Leste Asiático, notamos claramente a presença de 7-Elevens em praticamente todos os lugares – e não só ficamos surpresos com o quão difundidos e populares eles eram, como rapidamente percebemos que eles tinham muitas coisas incríveis que não temos nos Estados Unidos – como baos, chás, sandos, macarrão instantâneo, cafés gelados, sabores únicos de salgadinhos, sanduíches de panqueca, sorvete de milho – e muito mais!! E quando voltamos, comecei a notar quantas pessoas online também estavam indo a 7-Elevens internacionais e comprando lanches – e percebi – que isso é um movimento de lojas de conveniência!!\n\nEntão, em nossas viagens no ano passado, coletamos informações sobre passeios e compras de 7-Elevens em cada país que visitamos – Cingapura, Malásia e Japão… para experimentar alguns lanches virais e compará-los, mas também principalmente para nos deliciarmos!

Dan begitu kami kembali - saya mulai memperhatikan berapa banyak orang daring yang juga pergi ke 7-Eleven internasional dan melakukan pembelian makanan ringan - dan saya menyadari - ini adalah gerakan toko serba ada!! \n\nJadi dalam perjalanan kami selama setahun terakhir, kami telah mengumpulkan tur dan pembelian 7-Eleven di setiap negara yang kami kunjungi - Singapura, Malaysia, dan Jepang… untuk mencoba beberapa makanan ringan yang sedang tren, dan membandingkannya secara umum, tetapi juga sebagian besar hanya untuk berpesta! 7-Eleven negara mana yang harus kami kunjungi selanjutnya?

            "description": "(AP) The man suspected of killing a Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another has been taken into custody, two law enforcement officials said, bringing an end to a nearly two-day search that put the state on edge.\r\n\r\nVance Boelter was arrested Sunday evening. The arrest was confirmed to The Associated Press by law enforcement officials were who were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin home, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away.\r\n\r\nBoelter was captured in Minnesota, though officials didn’t immediately say where.\r\n\r\nA criminal complaint unsealed Sunday night says Boelter faces two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder in the deaths of the Hortmans and the wounding of Hoffman and his wife.\r\n\r\nThe Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champin early Saturday. After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned of that shooting, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans’ home.\r\n\r\nThe complaint says the Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home. It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene.\r\n\r\nEarlier Sunday Drew Evans, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said authorities found a car very early Sunday they believed Boelter was using, a few miles from his home in Green Isle, in the farm country about an hour west of Minneapolis. He also said they found evidence in the car that was relevant to the investigation, but did not provide details.\r\n\r\nAuthorities named Boelter, 57, as a suspect, saying he wore a mask as he posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car.\r\n\r\nEvens confirmed that investigators found a cowboy hat near the vehicle and believe it belonged to Boelter. The superintendent also said authorities interviewed Boelter’s wife and other family members in connection with Saturday’s shootings. He said they were cooperative and were not in custody.\r\n\r\nThe FBI had issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. They circulated a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings.\r\n\r\nMore than 100 law enforcement officers including SWAT teams were searching the area, including nearby homes, Evans said. He also said they had received more than 400 tips from the public.\r\n\r\nThe earlier search happened in rural Sibley County, roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis, where Boelter had a home with his wife and five children. Residents in the area received an emergency alert about the located vehicle that warned them to lock their doors and cars.\r\n\r\nThe shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned.\r\n\r\nBrightly colored flowers and small American flags were placed Sunday on the gray marbled stone of the Minnesota State Capitol along with a photo of the Hortmans. People scrawled messages on small notes including, “You were our leader through the hardest of times. Rest in Power.”\r\n\r\nFull coverage: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/nation-world/minnesota-lawmakers-shooting-suspect-search-hortman-hoffman/507-24c79278-b67b-426c-bb87-ff0d1bc1c1db",

            "description": "On July 11, the entire world will look up. Get tickets now for #Superman - Only In Theaters and @IMAX \n\n“Superman,” DC Studios’ first feature film to hit the big screen, is set to soar into theaters worldwide this summer from Warner Bros. Pictures.  In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind. \n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with composer David Fleming (“The Last of Us”) and editors William Hoy (“The Batman”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).  \n\nDC Studios Presents a Troll Court Entertainment/The Safran Company Production, A James Gunn Film, “Superman,” which will be in theaters and IMAX® nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.",

                "description": "On July 11, the entire world will look up. Get tickets now for #Superman - Only In Theaters and @IMAX \n\n“Superman,” DC Studios’ first feature film to hit the big screen, is set to soar into theaters worldwide this summer from Warner Bros. Pictures.  In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind. \n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with composer David Fleming (“The Last of Us”) and editors William Hoy (“The Batman”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).  \n\nDC Studios Presents a Troll Court Entertainment/The Safran Company Production, A James Gunn Film, “Superman,” which will be in theaters and IMAX® nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros.

She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold.

In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards.

As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialAudio",

My LEGO train travels through HUGE mountains, glow-in-the-dark and LED lit tunnels and down an insane DIY pool-noodle spiral coaster. But will the train make it or will this end in a complete disaster? \n\n♡ Get the merch: https://aquariuminfo.com/ (worldwide shipping 🌎)\n\nSUBSCRIBE for a chance at the ecosystem kit\n►  https://www.youtube.com/c/AquariumInfo?sub_confirmation=1\n\nMeet The Crew!\n🐈 Nori\n🐲 Gizmo\n🦀 Noodle & Pickle\n🦞 Mochi\n🐢 Harry \n🦐 Ralph\n🐸 Frito & Burrito\n🦎 Lucy & Lemon\n🐠 Peanut & Jelly\n🦎 Lime & Pepper & Squeak\n🪦 R.I.P. Kirby\n\nWatch as we build an insane 200ft LEGO railway through the studio, passing by some of your favorite animals, including Ralph my Peacock Mantis Shrimp, Mochi, my grocery store lobster, and the beloved duo Lucy and Lemon, my axolotls. We even build my kitten Nori a rube goldberg contraption to feed him treats when the train passes by! In this adventure-filled episode, we also travel to an abandoned railway to learn about trains in the real world! \n\nThis LEGO train trip will have 5 epic stops, including a dual greenhouse filled with live plants and LEGO botanicals, a snowy mountain featuring miniature Christmas trees and LEGO Santa, a cat cafe, a glow-in-the-dark tunnel with glowing crystals and an arid desert ecosystem with LEGO animals and real cacti. The LEGO train will be equipped with a tiny camera so you can see what the train sees, so be on the lookout for all of the hidden LEGO builds along the way! Can you spot them all?\n\nWatch until the end to see if the train makes it through the entire trip in one piece! This video is perfect for anyone who loves LEGO trains, building custom LEGO builds, axolotls, exotic pets, rare animals, DIY projects or is just interested in what it takes to build an epic DIY LEGO railway! \n\nIf you have any comments, suggestions or questions for this LEGO train video or future videos, leave them down in the comments!
