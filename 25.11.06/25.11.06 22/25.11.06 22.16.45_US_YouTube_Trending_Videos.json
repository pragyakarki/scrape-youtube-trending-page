            "description": "A new set of rules. A new level of fear. Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 only in theaters December 5. Get tickets now.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

Are you climbing up the walls?\nAre you deafened by the headlines? Or does your head not hear at all? Are you pacified by passion?\nAre you armed to the teeth?\nAre you bubbling at the surface, of what’s cooking underneath?\nAre you dying for an answer?\nFrom what they call good grief?\nBut there’s a terrific chance there’s nothing, beyond what you believe\n\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m in glory\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m going to get no glory\nRunning to the exit with a huge grin on my face \nScreaming hope is behind and I wanna get high\n\nI went to the liquor store and they took all my money\nI stared into the mirror there and begged a man to love me\nDo you love your blessed father? Anoint by fear of death\nDo you feel the lies creep on by? As soft as baby’s breath\nDo you beg that truth will set you free? Are you shackled by the keys?\nWell if I was you, I’d stay strapped in, cos’ all you’ve got is me.\n\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m in glory\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m going to get no glory\nRunning to the exit with a huge grin on my face \nScreaming hope is behind and I wanna get high\n\n#themountain #gorillaz #newmusic #kong",

Are you climbing up the walls?\nAre you deafened by the headlines? Or does your head not hear at all? Are you pacified by passion?\nAre you armed to the teeth?\nAre you bubbling at the surface, of what’s cooking underneath?\nAre you dying for an answer?\nFrom what they call good grief?\nBut there’s a terrific chance there’s nothing, beyond what you believe\n\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m in glory\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m going to get no glory\nRunning to the exit with a huge grin on my face \nScreaming hope is behind and I wanna get high\n\nI went to the liquor store and they took all my money\nI stared into the mirror there and begged a man to love me\nDo you love your blessed father? Anoint by fear of death\nDo you feel the lies creep on by? As soft as baby’s breath\nDo you beg that truth will set you free? Are you shackled by the keys?\nWell if I was you, I’d stay strapped in, cos’ all you’ve got is me.\n\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m in glory\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m going to get no glory\nRunning to the exit with a huge grin on my face \nScreaming hope is behind and I wanna get high\n\n#themountain #gorillaz #newmusic #kong"

            "description": "New creatures. New era. Experience the Ice Age like never before. Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age premieres November 26 on Apple TV https://apple.co/_PrehistoricPlanet\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” is a sweeping new installment of the award-winning natural history series from executive producers Jon Favreau and Mike Gunton, produced by BBC Studios Natural History Unit (“Planet Earth”), and narrated by Golden Globe Award and Olivier Award winner Tom Hiddleston (“Earthsounds”), with an original score by Hans Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve from Bleeding Fingers Music. The five-part docuseries, set to premiere globally on November 26, 2025, invites viewers into a dramatic new era of prehistoric life, millions of years after the extinction of the dinosaurs — an era shaped by ice, the intense fight to survive and the rise of a new cast of giants: the iconic megafauna.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” uses the latest scientific research and cutting-edge visual effects to bring this frozen world to life like never before, unveiling the spectacular habitats and inhabitants of ancient Earth for a one-of-a-kind experience. From towering woolly mammoths to elusive snow sloths, terrifying saber-toothed tigers to resilient dwarf elephants (only 3 feet tall), the series reveals the epic struggles and unexpected stories of animals that once ruled the Ice Age. Viewers will journey through vast tundras, barren deserts, expanding grasslands and melting permafrost as these creatures battle for survival in the face of extreme climates, shifting landscapes and the onset of “The Big Freeze,” and ultimately, “The Big Melt.”\n\nThe series is produced by the world-renowned team at BBC Studios Natural History Unit with support from the photorealistic visual effects of Framestore (“Gravity,” “The Golden Compass”). Theme by Hans Zimmer, with an original score by Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve for Bleeding Fingers Music.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” continues the storytelling journey of the acclaimed Apple TV natural history series “Prehistoric Planet,” which transported viewers 66 million years into the past to witness the age of dinosaurs across two seasons. Blending cinematic storytelling with photorealistic visual effects, the series brings ancient worlds to life, offering a firsthand look at some of the most extraordinary creatures ever to walk the Earth.

                "description": "New creatures. New era. Experience the Ice Age like never before. Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age premieres November 26 on Apple TV https://apple.co/_PrehistoricPlanet\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” is a sweeping new installment of the award-winning natural history series from executive producers Jon Favreau and Mike Gunton, produced by BBC Studios Natural History Unit (“Planet Earth”), and narrated by Golden Globe Award and Olivier Award winner Tom Hiddleston (“Earthsounds”), with an original score by Hans Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve from Bleeding Fingers Music. The five-part docuseries, set to premiere globally on November 26, 2025, invites viewers into a dramatic new era of prehistoric life, millions of years after the extinction of the dinosaurs — an era shaped by ice, the intense fight to survive and the rise of a new cast of giants: the iconic megafauna.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” uses the latest scientific research and cutting-edge visual effects to bring this frozen world to life like never before, unveiling the spectacular habitats and inhabitants of ancient Earth for a one-of-a-kind experience. From towering woolly mammoths to elusive snow sloths, terrifying saber-toothed tigers to resilient dwarf elephants (only 3 feet tall), the series reveals the epic struggles and unexpected stories of animals that once ruled the Ice Age. Viewers will journey through vast tundras, barren deserts, expanding grasslands and melting permafrost as these creatures battle for survival in the face of extreme climates, shifting landscapes and the onset of “The Big Freeze,” and ultimately, “The Big Melt.”\n\nThe series is produced by the world-renowned team at BBC Studios Natural History Unit with support from the photorealistic visual effects of Framestore (“Gravity,” “The Golden Compass”). Theme by Hans Zimmer, with an original score by Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve for Bleeding Fingers Music.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” continues the storytelling journey of the acclaimed Apple TV natural history series “Prehistoric Planet,” which transported viewers 66 million years into the past to witness the age of dinosaurs across two seasons.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

What. Fun.:\nClaire Clauster (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the glue that holds her chaotic, lovable family together every holiday season. From perfectly frosted cookies to meticulously wrapped gifts, no one decks the halls quite like Claire. But this year, as her grown kids and distracted husband get swept up in their own seasonal dramas, they make one crucial mistake: they forget their mom. By the time they realize she's missing, Claire’s already set off on a festive adventure of her own - one that doesn’t involve cooking, cleaning, or coordinating anyone else’s chaos. As her family scrambles to find her and salvage their Christmas, Claire rediscovers what the holidays mean when you’re finally free to put yourself first.\n\nWith a dazzling ensemble cast including Felicity Jones, Chloë Grace Moretz, Denis Leary, Dominic Sessa, Danielle Brooks, Devery Jacobs, Havana Rose Liu, Maude Apatow, with Jason Schwartzman with Eva Longoria and Joan Chen, Oh. What. Fun. is a spirited holiday comedy from director Michael Showalter and writers Chandler Baker and Showalter.

Other returning original legacy characters.\n\nThis is meant to be similar to Marvel bringing back Hugh Jackman as Wolverine during  Deadpool and Wolverine, Avengers Doomsday & Avengers Secret Wars.

Karakter-karakter asli lainnya yang kembali.\n\nIni dimaksudkan serupa dengan Marvel yang membawa kembali Hugh Jackman sebagai Wolverine dalam Deadpool dan Wolverine, Avengers: Doomsday & Avengers: Secret Wars.

Brendan Fraser et Rachel Weisz sont de retour pour une suite à La Momie : Le Retour (La Momie 2). Ils ignorent les événements de La Momie 3 : La Tombe de l'Empereur Dragon. Cela explique pourquoi Rachel Weisz a quitté la franchise plus tôt et pourquoi ils font comme si La Momie 3 n'avait jamais existé. Ce que cela implique pour l'intrigue de La Momie 4. D'autres personnages emblématiques de la franchise originale font leur retour.\n\nL'idée est similaire au retour de Hugh Jackman dans le rôle de Wolverine pour Deadpool et Wolverine, Avengers : Doomsday et Avengers : Secret Wars. Cela explique aussi la brève tentative d'Universal de transformer les films La Momie en une franchise Marvel avec le teaser de The Dark Universe et le film La Momie avec Tom Cruise en 2017. Et pourquoi cela a échoué.\n\nJe ferai d'autres vidéos pour La Momie 4 dès qu'une bande-annonce ou des images seront disponibles. Nous aurons plus d'informations et d'annonces l'année prochaine.\n\nDe nombreuses sorties importantes sont prévues avant la fin de l'année : la bande-annonce de Marvel Avengers : Doomsday, celle de Spider-Man : Un Nouveau Jour, celle de Green Lantern, Superman 2 : L'Homme de Demain, la bande-annonce de Supergirl, et bien d'autres !\n\nMa vidéo complète de l'épisode 3 de « Bienvenue à Derry » sera également publiée dimanche !\n\nIllustrations via https://www.deviantart.com/mrandrew7w7\n\nChaîne Twitch : https://twitch.tv/emergencyawesome\n\nTwitter : https://x.com/awesomemergency\nFacebook : https://facebook.com/emergencyawesome\nInstagram : https://instagram.com/emergencyawesome\nTumblr : https://robotchallenger.com\nSite web : https://emergencyawesome.com\n\n:: Playlists vidéo des émissions ::\n\nNouvelles vidéos d'Emergency Awesome : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxQXxyV_2D8kuEs_QsuQIyJ\nÉpisodes de House of The Dragon : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxqJeNeCsF_ghizcTS9nM4X\nÉpisodes de Loki https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczy8mUNqHU-35xtTd-JpJU3l\n\nÉpisodes de The Mandalorian https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzsN78nOjS-ABHwKaB7KONW\n\nÉpisodes de Game of Thrones https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPOIeYdZ3QczxGuSDE8NtOuthqbKFChC0q\n\nFilms Marvel et Avengers https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwWT3yd94Xc6n-ooI85uV_u\n\nÉpisodes d'Avatar, le dernier maître de l'air https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczx-z2jyyX4naSnE1A8d0hkC\n\nSaison 5 de The Boys Épisodes : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczw-KMQyuCrxcxV3mSQWTAdR\n\nVidéos Spider-Man : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzbRhRiGhj3-MaZ_24kadOy\n\nBatman et les films DC : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\n\nVidéos Justice League (Version Snyder) : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\n\nFilms Star Wars : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczztMg8cT1WS0P8ATv-MhUEJ\n\nMerci d'avoir regardé !"

Brendan Fraser und Rachel Weisz kehren für eine Fortsetzung von „Die Mumie kehrt zurück“ (Die Mumie 2) zurück. Die Ereignisse von „Die Mumie 3: Das Grabmal des Drachenkaisers“ werden ignoriert. Wir erklären, warum Rachel Weisz die Reihe vorzeitig verließ und warum „Die Mumie 3“ so getan wird, als hätte es nie stattgefunden. Was bedeutet das für die Handlung von „Die Mumie 4“? Weitere Charaktere aus der Reihe kehren zurück.\n\nDies soll ähnlich sein wie Marvels Rückkehr von Hugh Jackman als Wolverine in „Deadpool & Wolverine“, „Avengers: Doomsday“ und „Avengers: Secret Wars“. Wir erklären auch Universals kurzen Versuch, die „Mumien“-Filme mit dem „Dark Universe“-Teaser und dem Tom-Cruise-„Mumienfilm“ von 2017 in ein Marvel-Franchise zu verwandeln – und warum dieser Versuch scheiterte.\n\nSobald ein Trailer oder anderes Material veröffentlicht wird, folgen weitere Videos zu „Die Mumie 4“. Nächstes Jahr gibt es dann weitere Neuigkeiten und Ankündigungen.\n\nBis zum Jahresende stehen noch viele tolle Sachen an: Der Trailer zu Marvel Avengers: Doomsday, der Trailer zu Spider-Man: Brand New Day, der Trailer zu Green Lanterns, Superman 2: Man of Tomorrow, der Trailer zu Supergirl und vieles mehr!\n\nMein komplettes Video zu „ES: Willkommen in Derry“, Folge 3, erscheint ebenfalls am Sonntag!\n\nKunstwerk via https://www.deviantart.com/mrandrew7w7\n\nTwitch-Kanal: https://twitch.tv/emergencyawesome\nTwitter: https://x.com/awesomemergency\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/emergencyawesome\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/emergencyawesome\nTumblr: https://robotchallenger.com\nMeine Website: https://emergencyawesome.com\n\n:: Video-Playlists für Serien ::\n\nNeue Emergency Awesome Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxQXxyV_2D8kuEs_QsuQIyJ\nHouse of the Dragon Folgen: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxqJeNeCsF_ghizcTS9nM4X\nLoki Folgen https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczy8mUNqHU-35xtTd-JpJU3l\nThe Mandalorian – Folgen https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzsN78nOjS-ABHwKaB7KONW\nGame of Thrones – Folgen https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPOIeYdZ3QczxGuSDE8NtOuthqbKFChC0q\nMarvel-Filme und Avengers https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwWT3yd94Xc6n-ooI85uV_u\nAvatar – Der Herr der Elemente – Folgen https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczx-z2jyyX4naSnE1A8d0hkC\n„The Boys“, Staffel 5: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczw-KMQyuCrxcxV3mSQWTAdR\nSpider-Man-Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzbRhRiGhj3-MaZ_24kadOy\nBatman und DC-Filme: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nJustice League: Snyder Cut: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nStar-Wars-Filme https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczztMg8cT1WS0P8ATv-MhUEJ\n\nVielen Dank fürs Zuschauen!"

Брендан Фрейзер та Рейчел Вайс повертаються у продовженні фільму «Мумія повертається» («Мумія 2»). Вони ігнорують події фільму «Мумія 3: Гробниця Імператора Драконів». Пояснюють, чому Рейчел Вайс раніше покинула франшизу, і чому вони вдають, що «Мумії 3» ніколи не було. Що це означає для сюжету «Мумії 4». Повернення інших оригінальних персонажів-спадщин.\n\nЦе має бути схоже на те, як Marvel повертає Г'ю Джекмана до ролі Росомахи під час фільмів «Дедпул і Росомаха», «Месники: Судний день» та «Месники: Таємні війни». А також пояснюють коротку спробу Universal перетворити фільми про Мумію на франшизу Marvel за допомогою тизера «Темного всесвіту» з фільмом «Мумія» з Томом Крузом 2017 року. І чому це не вдалося.\n\nЯ зроблю більше відео для «Мумії 4», як тільки вони випустять трейлер або кадри. Ми отримаємо більше новин та анонсів наступного року.\n\nДо кінця року вийде багато важливих подій: трейлер фільму «Судний день» від Marvel: Месники, трейлер фільму «Новий день» від Людини-павука, трейлер фільму «Зелений Ліхтар» від «Ліхтарів», трейлер фільму «Супермен 2: Людина завтрашнього дня», трейлер фільму «Супердівчина» та багато іншого!\n\nМоє повне відео «Ласкаво просимо до Деррі: Епізод 3» також буде опубліковано в неділю!\n\nМистецтво через https://www.deviantart.com/mrandrew7w7\n\nКанал Twitch https://twitch.tv/emergencyawesome\nTwitter https://x.com/awesomemergency\nFacebook https://facebook.com/emergencyawesome\nInstagram https://instagram.com/emergencyawesome\nTumblr https://robotchallenger.com\nМій веб-сайт https://emergencyawesome.com\n\n:: Відеоплейлисти для шоу ::\n\nНові надзвичайні приголомшливі відео https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxQXxyV_2D8kuEs_QsuQIyJ\nЕпізоди «Дому Дракона» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxqJeNeCsF_ghizcTS9nM4X\nЕпізоди «Локі» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczy8mUNqHU-35xtTd-JpJU3l\nЕпізоди «Мандалорець» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzsN78nOjS-ABHwKaB7KONW\nЕпізоди «Гри престолів» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPOIeYdZ3QczxGuSDE8NtOuthqbKFChC0q\nФільми Marvel та «Месники» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwWT3yd94Xc6n-ooI85uV_u\nЕпізоди «Аватара: Легенди Ааги» https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczx-z2jyyX4naSnE1A8d0hkC\nХлопці Епізоди 5 сезону https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczw-KMQyuCrxcxV3mSQWTAdR\nВідео про Людину-павука https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzbRhRiGhj3-MaZ_24kadOy\nФільми про Бетмена та DC https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nВідео про Лігу Справедливості зі Снайдером https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nФільми про Зоряні війни https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nДЯКУЮ ЗА ПЕРЕГЛЯД!!"

Brendan Fraser en Rachel Weisz keren terug voor een vervolg op The Mummy Returns (The Mummy 2). Ze negeren de gebeurtenissen uit The Mummy 3 Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Ze leggen uit waarom Rachel Weisz de franchise eerder verliet en waarom ze doen alsof The Mummy 3 nooit heeft bestaan. Wat dit betekent voor de plot van The Mummy 4. Andere terugkerende personages uit de originele serie.\n\nDit is vergelijkbaar met Marvel's terugkeer van Hugh Jackman als Wolverine tijdens Deadpool and Wolverine, Avengers Doomsday en Avengers Secret Wars. En ze leggen Universal's korte poging uit om The Mummy Movies om te vormen tot een Marvel-franchise met de teaser van The Dark Universe met de Tom Cruise Mummy Movie uit 2017. En waarom dat mislukte.\n\nIk zal meer video's maken voor The Mummy 4 zodra ze een trailer of beelden hebben uitgebracht.

Brendan Fraser e Rachel Weisz tornano per un sequel de La Mummia - Il Ritorno (La Mummia 2). Ignorano gli eventi di La Mummia 3 - La Tomba dell'Imperatore Dragone. Spiegano perché Rachel Weisz ha abbandonato il franchise prima del previsto e perché fingono che La Mummia 3 non sia mai stato realizzato. Cosa questo significherà per la trama de La Mummia 4. Altri personaggi originali che torneranno.\n\nQuesto dovrebbe essere simile al ritorno di Hugh Jackman nei panni di Wolverine da parte della Marvel in Deadpool e Wolverine, Avengers Doomsday e Avengers Secret Wars. E spiegano il breve tentativo della Universal di trasformare i film de La Mummia in un franchise Marvel con il teaser di The Dark Universe con Tom Cruise, il film La Mummia del 2017. E perché è fallito.\n\nFarò altri video per La Mummia 4 non appena pubblicheranno un trailer o un filmato.

Брендан Фрейзер и Рэйчел Вайс возвращаются для продолжения «Мумии Возвращается» (Мумии 2). Они игнорируют события «Мумии 3: Гробница Императора Драконов». Объясняют, почему Рэйчел Вайс покинула франшизу раньше и почему они делают вид, будто «Мумии 3» никогда не было. Что это значит для сюжета «Мумии 4». Другие возвращающиеся оригинальные персонажи.\n\nЭто похоже на возвращение Marvel Хью Джекмана в роли Росомахи в фильмах «Дэдпул и Росомаха», «Судный день» и «Тайные войны Мстителей». И объясняют краткую попытку Universal превратить фильмы «Мумия» во франшизу Marvel с помощью тизера «Тёмной Вселенной» к фильму «Мумия» с Томом Крузом в 2017 году. И почему это не удалось.\n\nЯ сделаю больше видео о «Мумии 4», как только выйдет трейлер или отснятый материал.

Brendan Fraser e Rachel Weisz retornam para uma sequência que dá continuidade ao legado de A Múmia 2 (A Múmia 3). Eles estão ignorando os eventos de A Múmia 3: A Tumba do Imperador Dragão. Explicando por que Rachel Weisz deixou a franquia anteriormente e por que estão fingindo que A Múmia 3 nunca aconteceu. O que isso significa para o enredo de A Múmia 4. Outros personagens originais que retornam.\n\nIsso é semelhante à estratégia da Marvel de trazer Hugh Jackman de volta como Wolverine durante Deadpool e Wolverine, Vingadores: O Retorno do Poder e Vingadores: Guerras Secretas. E explicando a breve tentativa da Universal de transformar os filmes da Múmia em uma franquia da Marvel com o teaser do Universo Sombrio, com o filme da Múmia com Tom Cruise em 2017. E por que isso falhou.\n\nFarei mais vídeos sobre A Múmia 4 assim que lançarem um trailer ou cenas. Teremos mais notícias e anúncios no próximo ano.\n\nTem muita coisa boa chegando antes do fim do ano: o trailer de Vingadores: O Apocalipse, o trailer de Homem-Aranha: Um Novo Dia, o trailer de Lanterna Verde, Superman 2: O Homem do Amanhã, o trailer de Supergirl e muito mais!\n\nMeu vídeo completo do episódio 3 de IT: Bem-vindo a Derry também será postado no domingo!\n\nArte via https://www.deviantart.com/mrandrew7w7\n\nCanal da Twitch: https://twitch.tv/emergencyawesome\nTwitter: https://x.com/awesomemergency\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/emergencyawesome\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/emergencyawesome\nTumblr: https://robotchallenger.com\nMeu site: https://emergencyawesome.com\n\n:: Listas de reprodução de vídeos dos programas ::\n\nNovos vídeos do Emergency Awesome: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxQXxyV_2D8kuEs_QsuQIyJ\nEpisódios de House of the Dragon: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxqJeNeCsF_ghizcTS9nM4X\nEpisódios de Loki https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczy8mUNqHU-35xtTd-JpJU3l\nEpisódios de The Mandalorian https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzsN78nOjS-ABHwKaB7KONW\nEpisódios de Game of Thrones https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPOIeYdZ3QczxGuSDE8NtOuthqbKFChC0q\nFilmes da Marvel e Vingadores https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwWT3yd94Xc6n-ooI85uV_u\nEpisódios de Avatar: A Lenda de Aang https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczx-z2jyyX4naSnE1A8d0hkC\nTemporada de The Boys 5 Episódios https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczw-KMQyuCrxcxV3mSQWTAdR\nVídeos do Homem-Aranha https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzbRhRiGhj3-MaZ_24kadOy\nFilmes do Batman e da DC https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nVídeos da Liga da Justiça de Zack Snyder https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nFilmes de Star Wars https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczztMg8cT1WS0P8ATv-MhUEJ\n\nOBRIGADO POR ASSISTINDO!!"

Tal vez la suerte no fue suerte después de todo; tal vez el casino se había equivocado al darle ese dinero gratis.\n\nPara cuando la medianoche tiñó el techo, había convertido los 5.000 dólares en 40.000.

Entonces se detuvo... rojo otra vez. Estallaron los vítores.\n\nPero cuando extendió la mano para tomar sus fichas, la crupier se quedó paralizada. «Señor», dijo en voz baja, «esta mesa no está autorizada para créditos promocionales».\n\nBrettski parpadeó. El jefe de mesa dio un paso al frente. «Necesitamos verificar sus ganancias».\n\nLo acompañaron a una oficina silenciosa. El aire olía a humo y sospecha. Un hombre alto con traje gris se sentó frente a él, con los dedos entrelazados. «Dígame, señor Brettski», dijo lentamente, «¿quién le dio esos 5.000 dólares?».\n\nBrettski frunció el ceño. «¿Departamento de marketing? ¿Por qué?»\n\nEl hombre deslizó una foto sobre la mesa: imágenes de seguridad.

Неонові вогні мерехтіли на його обличчі, як електричне конфетті — і чому б йому не посміхнутися? Казино щойно дало йому 5000 доларів у безкоштовній грі. Без ризику, лише винагорода. Він почувався недоторканним.\n\nВін почав дрібними купюрами, вставляючи їх у стіл для блекджека. Карти танцювали в його напрямку — двадцять один, двадцять, знову двадцять один. Фішки складалися все вище і вище, і незабаром ввічлива посмішка дилера почала сіпатися. Бреттскі хихикнув; Можливо, удача була зовсім не удачею — можливо, казино помилилося, давши йому ці безкоштовні гроші.\n\nДо того часу, як опівночі стелю розфарбували, він перетворив 5000 доларів на 40 000 доларів. Поруч стояв бос піт-столу, вдаючи, що не дивиться. Бретцкі спробував удачу далі — рулетка. Червоне, чорне, червоне, подвійне зеро. Колесо оберталося, як сама доля. Потім воно приземлилося — знову червоне. Вибухнули оплески.\n\nАле коли він потягнувся за фішками, круп'є завмер. «Сер», — тихо сказала вона, — «за цим столом не дозволено використовувати промо-кредити».\n\nБретцкі кліпнув очима. Бос піт-столу виступив уперед. «Нам потрібно буде перевірити ваш виграш».\n\nЙого провели до тихого офісу. У повітрі пахло димом і підозрою. Високий чоловік у сірому костюмі сидів навпроти нього, сплетевши пальці. «Скажіть мені, містере Бретцкі», — повільно сказав він, — «хто дав вам ці 5000 доларів?»\n\nБретцкі насупився. «Маркетинговий відділ. Чому?»\n\nЧоловік просунув фотографію через стіл — запис з камери спостереження. Бретцкі стоїть біля вікна каси та приймає конверт. Тільки чоловік на відео був не ним.\n\nЗнову замерехтіло світло. Десь глибоко в казино завила сигналізація. Навушник боса піт-стопа затріщав: *«Він у будівлі».*\n\nБретцкі повернувся, щоб запитати, хто це...\n\n—але двері офісу відчинилися.\n\n#слоти #блекджек #азартні ігри #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nХто такий Бретцкі?

Он чувствовал себя неприкасаемым.\n\nОн начал с малого, бросая купюры на стол для блэкджека. Карты заплясали — двадцать один, двадцать, снова двадцать один. Фишки становились всё выше и выше, и вскоре вежливая улыбка дилера начала дрогнуть. Бреттски усмехнулся: может, удача была вовсе не удачей — может, казино ошиблось, выдав ему эти деньги.\n\nК полуночи, когда потолок красили, он превратил 5000 долларов в 40 000.

И вот оно остановилось — снова красное. Раздались радостные возгласы.\n\nНо когда он потянулся за фишками, крупье замерла. «Сэр, — тихо сказала она, — этот стол не предназначен для промо-кредитов».\n\nБреттски моргнул.

Зачем?»\n\nМужчина подвинул к столу фотографию — запись с камеры видеонаблюдения. Бреттски стоит у кассового окна, принимая конверт. Только человек на видео был не он.\n\nСвет снова замигал. Где-то в глубине казино завыла сигнализация. В наушнике пит-босса раздался треск: *«Он в здании».*\n\nБретцки обернулся, чтобы спросить, кто…\n\n— но дверь кабинета распахнулась.\n\n#слоты #блэкджек #азартные игры #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nКто такой Бреттски?

Dia merasa tak tersentuh.\n\nDia memulai dengan kecil, menggeserkan uang kertas ke meja blackjack. Kartu-kartu menari ke arahnya — dua puluh satu, dua puluh, dua puluh satu lagi.

Let’s go to war!\n\nPlay your favorite slots and table games completely for free at: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nBrettski stepped into the casino with a grin that could split the night in two. The neon lights flickered across his face like electric confetti — and why wouldn’t he smile? The casino had just handed him $5,000 in free play. No risk, all reward. He felt untouchable.\n\nHe started small, sliding bills into a blackjack table. The cards danced his way — twenty-one, twenty, twenty-one again. Chips stacked higher and higher, and soon the dealer’s polite smile began to twitch. Brettski chuckled; maybe luck wasn’t luck at all — maybe the casino had made a mistake giving him this free money.\n\nBy the time midnight painted the ceiling, he’d turned the $5,000 into $40,000. A pit boss hovered nearby, pretending not to watch. Brettski pushed his luck further — roulette. Red, black, red, double zero. The wheel spun like fate itself. Then it landed — red again. Cheers erupted.\n\nBut when he reached for his chips, the croupier froze. “Sir,” she said softly, “this table isn’t authorized for promotional credits.”\n\nBrettski blinked. The pit boss stepped forward. “We’ll need to verify your winnings.”\n\nHe was escorted to a quiet office. The air smelled of smoke and suspicion. A tall man in a gray suit sat across from him, fingers steepled. “Tell me, Mr. Brettski,” he said slowly, “who gave you that $5,000?”\n\nBrettski frowned. “Marketing desk. Why?”\n\nThe man slid a photo across the table — security footage. Brettski, standing at a cashier window, accepting an envelope. Only the man in the video wasn’t him.\n\nThe lights flickered again. Somewhere deep in the casino, alarms began to wail. The pit boss’s earpiece crackled: *“He’s in the building.”*\n\nBrettski turned to ask who—\n\n—but the office door burst open.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination."
