Get tickets now.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

            "description": "New creatures. New era. Experience the Ice Age like never before. Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age premieres November 26 on Apple TV https://apple.co/_PrehistoricPlanet\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” is a sweeping new installment of the award-winning natural history series from executive producers Jon Favreau and Mike Gunton, produced by BBC Studios Natural History Unit (“Planet Earth”), and narrated by Golden Globe Award and Olivier Award winner Tom Hiddleston (“Earthsounds”), with an original score by Hans Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve from Bleeding Fingers Music. The five-part docuseries, set to premiere globally on November 26, 2025, invites viewers into a dramatic new era of prehistoric life, millions of years after the extinction of the dinosaurs — an era shaped by ice, the intense fight to survive and the rise of a new cast of giants: the iconic megafauna.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” uses the latest scientific research and cutting-edge visual effects to bring this frozen world to life like never before, unveiling the spectacular habitats and inhabitants of ancient Earth for a one-of-a-kind experience. From towering woolly mammoths to elusive snow sloths, terrifying saber-toothed tigers to resilient dwarf elephants (only 3 feet tall), the series reveals the epic struggles and unexpected stories of animals that once ruled the Ice Age. Viewers will journey through vast tundras, barren deserts, expanding grasslands and melting permafrost as these creatures battle for survival in the face of extreme climates, shifting landscapes and the onset of “The Big Freeze,” and ultimately, “The Big Melt.”\n\nThe series is produced by the world-renowned team at BBC Studios Natural History Unit with support from the photorealistic visual effects of Framestore (“Gravity,” “The Golden Compass”). Theme by Hans Zimmer, with an original score by Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve for Bleeding Fingers Music.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” continues the storytelling journey of the acclaimed Apple TV natural history series “Prehistoric Planet,” which transported viewers 66 million years into the past to witness the age of dinosaurs across two seasons. Blending cinematic storytelling with photorealistic visual effects, the series brings ancient worlds to life, offering a firsthand look at some of the most extraordinary creatures ever to walk the Earth. The complete first two seasons of “Prehistoric Planet” are available to stream now on Apple TV.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nX: https://X.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

                "description": "New creatures. New era. Experience the Ice Age like never before. Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age premieres November 26 on Apple TV https://apple.co/_PrehistoricPlanet\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” is a sweeping new installment of the award-winning natural history series from executive producers Jon Favreau and Mike Gunton, produced by BBC Studios Natural History Unit (“Planet Earth”), and narrated by Golden Globe Award and Olivier Award winner Tom Hiddleston (“Earthsounds”), with an original score by Hans Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve from Bleeding Fingers Music. The five-part docuseries, set to premiere globally on November 26, 2025, invites viewers into a dramatic new era of prehistoric life, millions of years after the extinction of the dinosaurs — an era shaped by ice, the intense fight to survive and the rise of a new cast of giants: the iconic megafauna.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” uses the latest scientific research and cutting-edge visual effects to bring this frozen world to life like never before, unveiling the spectacular habitats and inhabitants of ancient Earth for a one-of-a-kind experience. From towering woolly mammoths to elusive snow sloths, terrifying saber-toothed tigers to resilient dwarf elephants (only 3 feet tall), the series reveals the epic struggles and unexpected stories of animals that once ruled the Ice Age. Viewers will journey through vast tundras, barren deserts, expanding grasslands and melting permafrost as these creatures battle for survival in the face of extreme climates, shifting landscapes and the onset of “The Big Freeze,” and ultimately, “The Big Melt.”\n\nThe series is produced by the world-renowned team at BBC Studios Natural History Unit with support from the photorealistic visual effects of Framestore (“Gravity,” “The Golden Compass”). Theme by Hans Zimmer, with an original score by Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve for Bleeding Fingers Music.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” continues the storytelling journey of the acclaimed Apple TV natural history series “Prehistoric Planet,” which transported viewers 66 million years into the past to witness the age of dinosaurs across two seasons. Blending cinematic storytelling with photorealistic visual effects, the series brings ancient worlds to life, offering a firsthand look at some of the most extraordinary creatures ever to walk the Earth. The complete first two seasons of “Prehistoric Planet” are available to stream now on Apple TV.\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nX: https://X.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

(to act this way)\nForces you to scream my name\nThen pretend that you can't stay (yeah)\nTell me, who I have to be (I know what we gotta do)\nTo get some reciprocity\nSee, no one loves you more than me\nAnd no one ever will\nNo matter how I think we grow\nYou always seem to let me know\nIt ain't working (it ain't working, no), it ain't working\nAnd when I try to walk away\nYou'd hurt yourself to make me stay\nThis is crazy, this is crazy (oh, this is crazy, uh-huh)\nI keep letting you back in (you back in)\nHow can I explain myself? (I don't understand why)\nAs painful as this thing has been\nI just can't be with no one else\nSee I know what we've got to do (yeah)\nYou let go (you let go), and I'll let go too (and I'll let go)\n'Cause no one's hurt me more than you\nAnd no one ever will\nNo matter how I think we grow\nYou always seem to let me know\nIt ain't working (it ain't working), it ain't working (it ain't working)\nAnd when I try to walk away\nYou'd hurt yourself to make me stay\nThis is crazy (this is crazy), this is crazy (this is crazy)\nCare for me, care for me\nI know you care for me\n(There) There for me, there for me\nSaid you'd be there for me\n(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me\nYou said you'd die for me\n(Give) Give to me, give to me\nWhy won't you live for me?\n(Care) Care for me, care for me\nYou said you'd care for me\n(There) There for me, there for me\nSaid you'd be there for me\n(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me\nYou said you'd die for me\n(Give) Give to me, give to me\nWhy won't you live for me?\nTake it down now\n(Cry) Take it down now\n(Give) Take it down now\n(Care) Take it down now\n(There) Take it down now\n(Cry) Take it down, take it down for now\n(Give)\n\n_____________\n🌅  Wallpaper: https://pixabay.com/\n\n─── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ──\n🌅  Kami Records\n✨.Website: http://kamirecords.co/\n✨.

This is absolutely exhausting since many of these achievements are a huge grind, but it's worth it for the nostalgia\n\nCheck out the new merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\n\nWatch the world record speedrun here: this video\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #Jacksmith #Speedrun"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

            "title": "Wheel Wednesday Gambling Got a HUGE Upgrade!",
            "description": "We are BACK at the Casino with another episode of everyone's favorite gambling series \"Wheel Wednesday!\" We now have an \"UPGRADE\" wheel, so be sure to comment some INSANE gambling ideas for it! Thank you all for watching! You’re all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nPlay your favorite slots and table games completely for free at: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nBrettski strutted into the casino with his signature grin and a GoPro strapped to his chest. It was Wheel Wednesday — the fan-favorite YouTube series where his comment section decided his fate. This week’s wheel was wild: “All-in on first spin,” “Play only $100 spins,” “Max bet on a random stranger’s choice,” and even “Blindfolded slot pick.” He set up the tripod, hit record, and gave the wheel a dramatic spin.\n\nThe pointer clicked, ticked, and finally landed on “Max bet on a random stranger’s choice.” The crowd watching nearby cheered. Brettski laughed nervously. “Alright… whose lucky day is it?” he asked, walking the casino floor. He stopped at an elderly woman feeding quarters into a dusty old Buffalo machine.\n\n“Ma’am,” he said, “pick any slot in this casino — I’m going all in.”\n\nShe smiled mysteriously and pointed to the far corner. “That one,” she said softly. “Machine 47. It’s due.”\n\nBrettski felt a chill. Machine 47 was an ancient, half-lit slot tucked under a flickering light. He loaded in $1,000, max bet, and pressed spin.\n\nThe reels spun violently. Lights flashed. The screen froze. Then — JACKPOT BONUS! The meter skyrocketed. His camera caught every second as people gathered, shouting. But just as the jackpot number climbed past $50,000… the screen glitched out and went black.\n\nThe crowd gasped. A pit boss rushed over. Brettski’s heart pounded. The old woman was gone.\n\nThe machine rebooted, and across the screen, one phrase appeared in red letters:\n\n“Continue… Y/N?”\n\nThe pit boss frowned. “That… shouldn’t be possible.”\n\nBrettski stared at the flickering Y button. The jackpot counter still hovered — frozen — at $74,980.\n\nHe reached toward it. The moment his finger touched the button, the machine let out a high-pitched tone — and the lights in the entire casino went dark.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination.",

                "title": "Wheel Wednesday Gambling Got a HUGE Upgrade!",
                "description": "We are BACK at the Casino with another episode of everyone's favorite gambling series \"Wheel Wednesday!\" We now have an \"UPGRADE\" wheel, so be sure to comment some INSANE gambling ideas for it! Thank you all for watching! You’re all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nPlay your favorite slots and table games completely for free at: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nBrettski strutted into the casino with his signature grin and a GoPro strapped to his chest. It was Wheel Wednesday — the fan-favorite YouTube series where his comment section decided his fate. This week’s wheel was wild: “All-in on first spin,” “Play only $100 spins,” “Max bet on a random stranger’s choice,” and even “Blindfolded slot pick.” He set up the tripod, hit record, and gave the wheel a dramatic spin.\n\nThe pointer clicked, ticked, and finally landed on “Max bet on a random stranger’s choice.” The crowd watching nearby cheered. Brettski laughed nervously. “Alright… whose lucky day is it?” he asked, walking the casino floor. He stopped at an elderly woman feeding quarters into a dusty old Buffalo machine.\n\n“Ma’am,” he said, “pick any slot in this casino — I’m going all in.”\n\nShe smiled mysteriously and pointed to the far corner. “That one,” she said softly. “Machine 47. It’s due.”\n\nBrettski felt a chill. Machine 47 was an ancient, half-lit slot tucked under a flickering light. He loaded in $1,000, max bet, and pressed spin.\n\nThe reels spun violently. Lights flashed. The screen froze. Then — JACKPOT BONUS! The meter skyrocketed. His camera caught every second as people gathered, shouting. But just as the jackpot number climbed past $50,000… the screen glitched out and went black.\n\nThe crowd gasped. A pit boss rushed over. Brettski’s heart pounded. The old woman was gone.\n\nThe machine rebooted, and across the screen, one phrase appeared in red letters:\n\n“Continue… Y/N?”\n\nThe pit boss frowned. “That… shouldn’t be possible.”\n\nBrettski stared at the flickering Y button. The jackpot counter still hovered — frozen — at $74,980.\n\nHe reached toward it. The moment his finger touched the button, the machine let out a high-pitched tone — and the lights in the entire casino went dark.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination."

Que la guerre commence !\n\nJouez gratuitement à vos machines à sous et jeux de table préférés sur : https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nBrettski est arrivé au casino avec son sourire légendaire et une GoPro fixée sur la poitrine. C'était « La Roue du Mercredi », la série YouTube préférée des fans où leurs commentaires décident de son sort. Le thème de cette semaine était délirant : « Tout miser au premier tour », « Mises de 100 $ seulement », « Mise maximale sur le choix d'un inconnu », et même « Choix de machine à sous les yeux bandés ». Il a installé son trépied, lancé l'enregistrement et a fait tourner la roue avec panache.\n\nLe curseur cliqua, fit un tic-tac, et s'arrêta finalement sur « Mise maximale sur le choix d'un inconnu ». La foule massée à proximité applaudit. Brettski laissa échapper un rire nerveux. « Bon… à qui le tour ? » demanda-t-il en arpentant le casino. Il s'arrêta devant une dame âgée qui insérait des pièces dans une vieille machine Buffalo poussiéreuse.\n\n« Madame, dit-il, choisissez n'importe quelle machine de ce casino, je mise tout. »\n\nElle sourit mystérieusement et désigna le coin le plus éloigné. « Celle-ci, dit-elle doucement. La machine 47. C'est le moment. »\n\nBrettski eut un frisson. La machine 47 était une machine à sous antique, à moitié éclairée, dissimulée sous une lumière vacillante. Il inséra 1 000 $, la mise maximale, et appuya sur « Lancer ».\n\nLes rouleaux tournèrent violemment. Des lumières clignotèrent. L'écran se figea. Puis – JACKPOT BONUS ! Le compteur s'emballa. Sa caméra capta chaque seconde tandis que la foule se rassemblait en criant. Mais juste au moment où le jackpot dépassait les 50 000 $… l’écran s’est brouillé et est devenu noir.\n\nLa foule a retenu son souffle. Un chef de table s’est précipité. Le cœur de Brettski battait la chamade. La vieille dame avait disparu.\n\nLa machine a redémarré et, sur l’écran, une phrase est apparue en lettres rouges :\n\n« Continuer… O/N ? »\n\nLe chef de table a froncé les sourcils. « Ce… ne devrait pas être possible. »\n\nBrettski fixait le bouton O qui clignotait. Le compteur du jackpot restait figé à 74 980 $.\n\nIl a tendu la main vers le bouton. Au moment où son doigt l’a effleuré, la machine a émis un son aigu et les lumières de tout le casino se sont éteintes.\n\n#machinesàsous #blackjack #jeuxdargent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ?

Andiamo in guerra!\n\nGioca alle tue slot e ai tuoi giochi da tavolo preferiti completamente gratis su: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nBrettski è entrato nel casinò con il suo sorriso inconfondibile e una GoPro legata al petto. Era il Wheel Wednesday, la serie YouTube preferita dai fan in cui la sua sezione commenti decideva il suo destino. La ruota di questa settimana era pazzesca: \"All-in al primo giro\", \"Gioca solo 100 giri\", \"Puntata massima su una scelta casuale di uno sconosciuto\" e persino \"Scelta di slot con gli occhi bendati\". Ha posizionato il treppiede, ha premuto il tasto di registrazione e ha fatto girare la ruota in modo spettacolare.\n\nIl puntatore scattò, fece un ticchettio e infine si fermò su \"Puntata massima su una scelta casuale di uno sconosciuto\". La folla che osservava lì vicino applaudì. Brettski rise nervosamente. \"Bene... di chi è il giorno fortunato?\" chiese, camminando per la sala del casinò. Si fermò davanti a un'anziana donna che infilava monete da 25 centesimi in una vecchia e polverosa slot machine Buffalo.\n\n\"Signora\", disse, \"scelga una qualsiasi slot machine di questo casinò: io punto tutto\".\n\nLei sorrise misteriosamente e indicò l'angolo più lontano. \"Quella\", disse dolcemente. \"Macchina 47. È il momento giusto\".\n\nBrettski sentì un brivido. La macchina 47 era un'antica slot machine semi-illuminata, nascosta da una luce tremolante. Caricò 1.000 dollari, puntata massima, e premette il pulsante \"Gira\".\n\nI rulli girarono violentemente. Le luci lampeggiarono. Lo schermo si bloccò. Poi... JACKPOT BONUS! Il contatore schizzò alle stelle. La sua macchina fotografica catturò ogni secondo di chi si radunava, gridando. Ma proprio quando il jackpot superava i 50.000 dollari... lo schermo si è bloccato ed è diventato nero.\n\nLa folla ha sussultato. Un responsabile di sala si è precipitato. Il cuore di Brettski ha iniziato a battere forte. L'anziana signora se n'era andata.\n\nLa macchina si è riavviata e sullo schermo è apparsa una frase in lettere rosse:\n\n\"Continua... S/N?\"\n\nIl responsabile di sala si è accigliato. \"Questo... non dovrebbe essere possibile.\"\n\nBrettski fissava il pulsante Y tremolante. Il contatore del jackpot era ancora fermo, fermo, a 74.980 dollari.\n\nSi è avvicinato. Nel momento in cui il suo dito ha toccato il pulsante, la macchina ha emesso un tono acuto e le luci dell'intero casinò si sono spente.\n\n#slot #blackjack #gioco d'azzardo #casinò #baccarat #roulette\n\nChi è Brettski?

Tłum obserwujący grę w pobliżu wiwatował. Brettski zaśmiał się nerwowo. „Dobra… czyj to szczęśliwy dzień?” zapytał, przechadzając się po kasynie. Zatrzymał się przy starszej kobiecie wrzucającej ćwierćdolarówki do zakurzonego, starego automatu Buffalo.\n\n„Proszę pani” – powiedział – „proszę wybrać dowolny automat w tym kasynie – stawiam all-in”.\n\nUśmiechnęła się tajemniczo i wskazała na przeciwległy róg. „Ten” – powiedziała cicho. „Maszyna 47.

Wrzucił 1000 dolarów, maksymalny zakład i nacisnął przycisk „Spin”.\n\nBębny kręciły się gwałtownie. Światła błysnęły. Ekran zamarł. Nagle – BONUS JACKPOTA! Licznik gwałtownie skoczył.

Он вложил 1000 долларов, максимальную ставку и нажал «Вращать».\n\nБарабаны бешено закрутились. Вспыхнули огни. Экран замер. А затем — БОНУС ДЖЕКПОТА! Счётчик взлетел до небес. Его камера запечатлела каждую секунду, как люди собирались, крича. Но как только сумма джекпота превысила 50 000 долларов… экран погас и погас.\n\nТолпа ахнула. Подбежал пит-босс. Сердце Бреттски заколотилось. Старушка исчезла.\n\nАвтомат перезагрузился, и на экране красными буквами появилась одна фраза:\n\n«Продолжить… Т/И?»\n\nПит-босс нахмурился. «Это… не должно быть возможным».\n\nБреттски уставился на мигающую кнопку «Y». Счётчик джекпота всё ещё завис — застыл — на отметке 74 980 долларов.\n\nОн потянулся к нему. В тот момент, когда его палец коснулся кнопки, автомат издал высокий звук — и свет во всём казино погас.\n\n#слоты #блэкджек #азартные игры #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nКто такой Бреттски?

Era Quarta-feira da Roda — a série favorita dos fãs no YouTube, onde sua seção de comentários decidia seu destino. A roda desta semana estava maluca: \"Aposta tudo na primeira rodada\", \"Jogue apenas rodadas de $100\", \"Aposta máxima na escolha de um estranho aleatório\" e até \"Escolha de caça-níqueis de olhos vendados\". Ele montou o tripé, apertou o botão de gravar e girou a roda dramaticamente.\n\nO ponteiro clicou, marcou e finalmente parou em “Aposta máxima na escolha de um estranho aleatório”. A multidão que assistia por perto vibrou. Brettski riu nervosamente. “Muito bem… de quem é o dia de sorte?”, perguntou, caminhando pelo cassino. Ele parou diante de uma senhora idosa que colocava moedas em uma velha e empoeirada máquina Buffalo.\n\n“Senhora”, disse ele, “escolha qualquer caça-níquel neste cassino — vou apostar tudo.”\n\nEla sorriu misteriosamente e apontou para o canto mais distante. “Aquela ali”, disse ela suavemente. “Máquina 47. Está para sair.”\n\nBrettski sentiu um arrepio. A Máquina 47 era um caça-níquel antigo, meio iluminado, escondido sob uma luz bruxuleante. Ele colocou US$ 1.000, a aposta máxima, e apertou o botão de girar.\n\nOs rolos giraram violentamente. Luzes piscaram. A tela congelou. Então — BÔNUS DO JACKPOT! O contador disparou. Sua câmera capturou cada segundo enquanto as pessoas se reuniam, gritando. Mas, assim que o prêmio acumulado ultrapassou os US$ 50.000… a tela apresentou uma falha e ficou preta.\n\nA multidão prendeu a respiração. Um supervisor de mesa correu até lá. O coração de Brettski disparou. A velha senhora havia sumido.\n\nA máquina reiniciou e, na tela, uma frase apareceu em letras vermelhas:\n\n“Continuar… S/N?”\n\nO supervisor franziu a testa. “Isso… não deveria ser possível.”\n\nBrettski encarou o botão Y piscando. O contador do prêmio acumulado ainda pairava — congelado — em US$ 74.980.\n\nEle estendeu a mão em direção ao botão. No instante em que seu dedo o tocou, a máquina emitiu um som agudo — e as luzes de todo o cassino se apagaram.\n\n#caça-níqueis #blackjack #apostas #cassino #bacará #roleta\n\nQuem é Brettski?

La ruleta de esta semana era impredecible: \"Apostar todo en el primer giro\", \"Jugar solo giros de $100\", \"Apuesta máxima a la elección de un desconocido\" e incluso \"Elección de tragamonedas con los ojos vendados\". Colocó el trípode, pulsó grabar y le dio un giro dramático a la ruleta.\n\nEl cursor hizo clic, marcó y finalmente se detuvo en “Apuesta máxima a la elección de un desconocido”.

Se detuvo ante una anciana que metía monedas en una vieja y polvorienta máquina Buffalo.\n\n“Señora”, dijo, “elija cualquier tragamonedas de este casino; voy con todo”.\n\nElla sonrió misteriosamente y señaló la esquina más alejada. “Esa”, dijo en voz baja. “La máquina 47. Ya toca”.\n\nBrettski sintió un escalofrío. La máquina 47 era una tragamonedas antigua, con poca luz, escondida bajo una luz parpadeante. Cargó 1000 dólares, la apuesta máxima, y ​​pulsó girar.\n\nLos rodillos giraron violentamente. Las luces destellaron. La pantalla se congeló. Entonces… ¡BONO DE PREMIO MAYOR! El medidor se disparó. Su cámara captó cada segundo mientras la gente se reunía, gritando. Justo cuando el premio mayor superó los 50.000 dólares… la pantalla falló y se puso negra.\n\nEl público contuvo el aliento. Un supervisor se acercó corriendo. El corazón de Brettski latía con fuerza.

Давайте війною!\n\nГрайте у свої улюблені слоти та настільні ігри абсолютно безкоштовно за адресою: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nБреттскі похмуро увійшов до казино зі своєю фірмовою посмішкою та камерою GoPro, прикріпленою до грудей. Це була \"Колесо середи\" — улюблений серіал фанатів на YouTube, де його розділ коментарів вирішив його долю. Колесо цього тижня було шаленим: \"Валл-ін на першому обертанні\", \"Грайте лише на обертання $100\", \"Максимальна ставка на вибір випадкового незнайомця\" і навіть \"Вибір слота із зав'язаними очима\". Він встановив штатив, натиснув кнопку запису та зробив драматичне обертання колеса.\n\nВказівник клацнув, цокнув і нарешті зупинився на «Максимальна ставка на вибір випадкового незнайомця». Натовп, що спостерігав неподалік, зааплодував. Бретцкі нервово засміявся. «Добре… чий сьогодні щасливий день?» — спитав він, йдучи по залу казино. Він зупинився біля літньої жінки, яка кидала 25-центові монети в запилений старий автомат Buffalo.\n\n«Пані», — сказав він, — «виберіть будь-який слот у цьому казино — я ставлю ва-банк».\n\nВона загадково посміхнулася і вказала на дальній кут. «Ось той», — тихо сказала вона. «Автомат 47. Він має бути встановлений».\n\nБретцкі відчув холодок. Автомат 47 був старовинним, напівосвітленим слотом, захованим під мерехтливим світлом. Він вставив 1000 доларів, максимальну ставку, і натиснув кнопку обертання.\n\nБарабани різко закрутилися. Спалахнуло світло. Екран завмер. Потім — ДЖЕКПОТ-БОНУС! Лічильник злетів до небес. Його камера фіксувала кожну секунду, як люди збиралися та кричали. Але щойно сума джекпоту перевищила 50 000 доларів… екран згас і потьмянів.\n\nНатовп ахнув. Підбіг бос піт-столу. Серце Бретцкі закалатало. Старої жінки не було.\n\nМашина перезавантажилася, і на екрані червоними літерами з'явилася одна фраза:\n\n«Продовжити… Так/Ні?»\n\nБос піт-столу нахмурився. «Це… не повинно бути можливо».\n\nБретцкі дивився на мерехтливу кнопку Y. Лічильник джекпоту все ще завис — застиг — на позначці 74 980 доларів.\n\nВін потягнувся до неї. Щойно його палець торкнувся кнопки, машина видала високий звук — і світло в усьому казино згасло.\n\n#слоти #блекджек #азартні ігри #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nХто такий Бретцкі?

Brettski tertawa gugup. \"Baiklah... hari keberuntungan siapa ini?\" tanyanya, sambil berjalan di lantai kasino. Ia berhenti di depan seorang wanita tua yang memasukkan koin 25 sen ke dalam mesin Buffalo tua yang berdebu.\n\n\"Nyonya,\" katanya, \"pilih slot mana saja di kasino ini — saya akan bertaruh penuh.\"\n\nWanita itu tersenyum misterius dan menunjuk ke sudut terjauh. \"Itu,\" katanya lembut. \"Mesin 47.

In charge of rehabilitating a group of ex-supervillains, you must manage your roster while navigating office relationships and rebuilding your suit for a shot at revenge. \n\nIn Dispatch, every decision you make influences the unfolding narrative. From banter in the breakroom to life-or-death situations in the field, your choices affect your relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path your own story takes.\n\nUse the strategy map to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Balance the risks and rewards as you make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for your team and the city.\n\nManaging heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero comes with quirks, flaws, and baggage you’ll need to navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.\n\nBlending narrative, strategy, and humor, Dispatch explores what it means to be a hero, whether you're wearing a cape or behind a desk.",
