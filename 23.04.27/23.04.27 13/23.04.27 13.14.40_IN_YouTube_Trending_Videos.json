Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family. He respects and values the morals and traditions of his family and refuses to let the family down.\n\nMeerab’s life takes an unexpected turn when she finds out about her family’s decision regarding her and Murtasim’s life. Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself. On the other hand, Meerab who is used to living her life on her own terms refuses to accept Murtasim’s family traditions and unnecessary social barriers.\n\nSoon their lives go through a series of emotional sufferings and misunderstandings where it becomes difficult for them to coexist. Despite their hatred towards each other, will Meerab and Murtasim accept their true feelings or will the dynamics of ego and self-respect force them to stay apart?\n\nWriter: Nooran Makhdoom\nDirector: Siraj ul Haq\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nYumna Zaidi as Meerab\nWahaj Ali as Murtasim\nBushra Ansari as Salma\nSohail Sameer as Anwar\nSabeena Farooq as Haya\nHira Soomro as Maryam\nFazila Qazi as Aneela\nFarhan Ally Agha as Waqas\nSeemi Pasha as Sabra\nMahmood Aslam as Malik Mukhtaar\nHaris Waheed\nAgha Mustafa\n\n#terebin \n#yumnazaidi \n#wahajali  \n#NisaBBCream",

Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family. He respects and values the morals and traditions of his family and refuses to let the family down.\n\nMeerab’s life takes an unexpected turn when she finds out about her family’s decision regarding her and Murtasim’s life. Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself. On the other hand, Meerab who is used to living her life on her own terms refuses to accept Murtasim’s family traditions and unnecessary social barriers.\n\nSoon their lives go through a series of emotional sufferings and misunderstandings where it becomes difficult for them to coexist. Despite their hatred towards each other, will Meerab and Murtasim accept their true feelings or will the dynamics of ego and self-respect force them to stay apart?\n\nWriter: Nooran Makhdoom\nDirector: Siraj ul Haq\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nYumna Zaidi as Meerab\nWahaj Ali as Murtasim\nBushra Ansari as Salma\nSohail Sameer as Anwar\nSabeena Farooq as Haya\nHira Soomro as Maryam\nFazila Qazi as Aneela\nFarhan Ally Agha as Waqas\nSeemi Pasha as Sabra\nMahmood Aslam as Malik Mukhtaar\nHaris Waheed\nAgha Mustafa\n\n#terebin \n#yumnazaidi \n#wahajali  \n#NisaBBCream"

Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n“The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).\n\n“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023.",

Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most.

Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself.

                "description": "Manchester City are two points off top spot in the Premier League after a storming 4-1 victory over leaders Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium.\nKevin De Bruyne’s seventh minute strike gave Pep Guardiola’s side and a raucous City support an early boost before John Stones’ header on the stroke of half-time doubled the lead.\nDe Bruyne made it three early in the second period with a measured stroke after turning the ball over in Arsenal’s half.\nThe Belgian was supplied excellently by Erling Haaland for both of his goals.\nArsenal defender Rob Holding claimed one back in the closing stages to give the visitors a flicker of hope.\nHowever, Haaland completed the scoring in added time by squeezing a left-footed finish under Aaron Ramsdale.\nIt's the Norwegian's 33rd strike of the season and takes him to a 38-game Premier League record, surpassing Mo Salah's tally of 32 in 2017/18.\nThe victory completes the league double over our title rivals and extends our excellent Premier League form to nine wins in our last ten matches.\nWith seven games to go and two games in hand on Arsenal, the destiny of what would be a third successive Premier League title and five in the last six seasons is in our hands.\n\nSUBSCRIBE! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=mancity\n\nhttp://www.mancity.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com/mancity\nhttp://www.twitter.com/mancity\nhttp://www.instagram.com/mancity\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mancity\n\nAbout the Official Man City YouTube Channel:\n\nHere you will find all the latest videos from Manchester City, including, all Premier League goals, highlights, behind-the-scenes footage, training and much more.\n\nGet closer to the likes of Jack Grealish, Bunny Shaw, Kevin De Bruyne, Lauren Hemp, Erling Haaland, Riyad Mahrez, Ellie Roebuck Phil Foden, Esme Morgan and the rest of Pep Guardiola & Gareth Taylor's teams!"

This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Shailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Bhavya Gandhi / Raj Anadkat). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu.

He advises her to give Munna a chance and not to deprive him of the love and marital bliss that he so rightfully deserves. As Samar opens up his heart, will Tina finally take Samar's word and move on?\n\nThe bright and beautiful Thapki is pretty much perfect... except for one minor flaw - she stammers. But that doesn't hold her back. All she needs is an encouraging pat on the back,a 'thapki', which soon becomes her name. Over the course of the show, Thapki falls in love with Dhruv, but is duped into getting married to his brother, Bihaan. In spite of this cruel twist of fate, Thapki doesn't let her spirit fade and does all she can to be the ideal bahu. What does destiny hold for this charming girl with an unbeatable spirit?\n\nWatch more videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX18mvVSh-bzmIBfH3sKcKbGZQJ_OGGIg\n\nTo subscribe to this channel, go to: https://www.youtube.com/c/ColorsRishtey1/featured\n\nFollow us on: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/colorsrishteyindia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rishteytv/\n\n#ColorsRishtey #ThapkiPyarKi #थपकीप्यारकी\n\nThe accuracy, completeness, currency and/or suitability of the above video description is not endorsed by its licensor or broadcaster or the Channel.

                "description": "Tina को पता चला सच | Thapki Pyar Ki | थपकी प्यार की | Full Episode | Ep. 694\n\nSeeing Tina's obsession for him, Samar suggests that she stop thinking about him and focus on Munna. He advises her to give Munna a chance and not to deprive him of the love and marital bliss that he so rightfully deserves. As Samar opens up his heart, will Tina finally take Samar's word and move on?\n\nThe bright and beautiful Thapki is pretty much perfect... except for one minor flaw - she stammers. But that doesn't hold her back. All she needs is an encouraging pat on the back,a 'thapki', which soon becomes her name. Over the course of the show, Thapki falls in love with Dhruv, but is duped into getting married to his brother, Bihaan. In spite of this cruel twist of fate, Thapki doesn't let her spirit fade and does all she can to be the ideal bahu. What does destiny hold for this charming girl with an unbeatable spirit?\n\nWatch more videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX18mvVSh-bzmIBfH3sKcKbGZQJ_OGGIg\n\nTo subscribe to this channel, go to: https://www.youtube.com/c/ColorsRishtey1/featured\n\nFollow us on: \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/colorsrishteyindia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rishteytv/\n\n#ColorsRishtey #ThapkiPyarKi #थपकीप्यारकी\n\nThe accuracy, completeness, currency and/or suitability of the above video description is not endorsed by its licensor or broadcaster or the Channel.
