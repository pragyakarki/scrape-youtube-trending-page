            "description": "The Chosen Season 5 in theaters March 28\n---\nI think I'm more excited to deliver this trailer than any we've done. Which isn't a coincidence because I feel the same way about Season Five as a whole. This is our most kick-butt content yet because we cover joy, pain, loyalty, betrayal, excitement, anger, sadness, and fear, sometimes within one episode.\n\nIt’s Holy Week, the most impactful and famous week in human history. Jerusalem is a powder keg with all of Jesus’ followers, enemies, and over a million Passover pilgrims packed into one small place. He shows sides of Himself we’ve never seen till now—turning over tables, literally cracking the whip, and weeping with heartbreak but also love. He also confuses His followers at every turn...and to what end?\n\nThe takeaway for you from this season: Can you believe and follow even when you don't understand?\n\nYes, it’s sad and heartbreaking because we’re getting closer to the cross, but we’re also going to get to see some of the most iconic and deeply moving moments from Scripture. The triumphal entry, the turning of the tables, the betrayal by Judas, and the Last Supper...all set against the biggest backdrop and sets we've ever used with a new widescreen format that demands to be seen on the big screen. But of course, we continue our obsession to humanize and authenticate everyone involved.\n\nThe table is set. I can't wait for you to see this in theaters.\n\nDallas Jenkins\nCreator, The Chosen\n\n---\nLearn more and get tickets: https://thechosenlastsupper.com/\n\nWatch The Chosen and find exclusive content free and easy on our app: https://www.thechosen.tv/en-us/explore/how-to-watch-the-chosen-season-4-app\n\nWear The Chosen gear and go deeper with our study materials: \nhttps://thechosengifts.com\n\nSupport The Chosen by donating to the Come and See Foundation: https://www.comeandsee.net/donate\n\n#thechosenlastsupper \n\n#BingeJesus by subscribing to our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/thechosenseries?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#GetUsedToDifferent by following us:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsideTheChosen\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thechosentvseries/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thechosentv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thechosentv",

            "description": "Thank you to all of you subscribers out there for quite frankly, making all this possible! We can’t wait to make more content for you guys over the coming months (and years) - next up, 2 videos we filmed in Malaysia!! \n\nHELLO FRIENDS and welcome to another video!! This week we are going to be showing you guys the ins ands outs of our entire renovation process for our new studio/office!! We have been haphazardly running around like chickens with our heads cut off for the last (8) years - and so we finally decided it was time to attempt to make our dream studio/office. And because we are huge fans of HGTV-style renovation content, we decided to renovate an old warehouse from top to bottom and document the entire process (also top to bottom).

We can’t wait to make more content for you guys over the coming months (and years) - next up, 2 videos we filmed in Malaysia!! \n\nHELLO FRIENDS and welcome to another video!! This week we are going to be showing you guys the ins ands outs of our entire renovation process for our new studio/office!! We have been haphazardly running around like chickens with our heads cut off for the last (8) years - and so we finally decided it was time to attempt to make our dream studio/office. And because we are huge fans of HGTV-style renovation content, we decided to renovate an old warehouse from top to bottom and document the entire process (also top to bottom). We may have bitten off more than we could chew - but we are pretty happy with how it turned out!

Wir können es kaum erwarten, in den kommenden Monaten (und Jahren) mehr Inhalte für euch zu erstellen – als Nächstes 2 Videos, die wir in Malaysia gedreht haben!! \n\nHALLO FREUNDE und willkommen zu einem weiteren Video!! Diese Woche zeigen wir euch die Einzelheiten unseres gesamten Renovierungsprozesses für unser neues Studio/Büro!! Wir sind die letzten (8) Jahre planlos wie aufgescheuchte Hühner herumgerannt – und so haben wir endlich beschlossen, dass es an der Zeit ist, zu versuchen, unser Traumstudio/Büro zu bauen. Und weil wir große Fans von Renovierungsinhalten im HGTV-Stil sind, haben wir beschlossen, ein altes Lagerhaus von oben bis unten zu renovieren und den gesamten Prozess (auch von oben bis unten) zu dokumentieren.

Minggu ini kami akan menunjukkan kepada kalian semua seluk-beluk seluruh proses renovasi untuk studio/kantor baru kami!! Kami telah berlarian seperti ayam tanpa kepala selama (8) tahun terakhir - dan akhirnya kami memutuskan sudah waktunya untuk mencoba membuat studio/kantor impian kami.

            "description": "Bobby Carter | February 20, 2025\nOn the morning of Leon Thomas' Tiny Desk concert, many NPR staffers assumed the show was postponed due to a snowstorm in the D.C. area. Not only did he proactively schedule his coast-to-coast flight but he was also 30 minutes early to the office. With his sophomore album, MUTT, Thomas has planted his flag as the most exciting artist in R&B music today. The Tiny Desk had to happen now; nothing would get in the way of divine timing.\n\nThomas was destined to be an entertainer — he's been doing it for most of his life. His parents were both musicians and introduced him to their world early on. As an actor, he appeared in multiple Broadway plays before becoming a staple on the Nickelodeon network. Under the tutelage of Babyface, he earned his chops as a writer and producer, eventually penning and producing big hits in R&B and hip-hop.\n\nHe opens this set with three songs from MUTT and closes with two from 2023's Electric Dusk, including \"Breaking Point,\" which he dedicates to his recently deceased grandfather, the opera singer John Anthony: \"This is one of his favorite songs.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"VIBES DON'T LIE\"\n\"YES IT IS\"\n\"MUTT\"\n\"Breaking Point\" \n\"Treasure In The Hills\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLeon Thomas: vocals, guitar\nChris Payton: guitar\nAli Roots: keys, piano\nJoe \"Jough\" Cleveland: bass\nQuintin \"Q\" Gulledge: drums\nTK: background vocals\nAyana Layli: background vocals\nSha'Leah Nikole: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Grace Raver\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #leonthomas",

Subscribe for more :)\n\nDownload the mod: https://modrinth.com/mod/blockprintr\n\nBlockPrintr Mod Tutorial: https://youtu.be/m8cF4Uo2tRE\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nExtended House Tour: https://youtu.be/_3jg5l1ccRg\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nThe Dream Team moved in together almost 3 years ago, and you guys have asked for a house tour ever since. I'm a Minecraft channel though, so of course we had to make it unique.\n\nWe coded a mod that makes it so you can scan things from real life into Minecraft. Of course the first thing we did with this mod was scan our ENTIRE HOUSE into Minecraft! We did this on Minecraft 1.21.4, but it's possible on basically any version! 1.8, 1.20, etc. The mod is called BlockPrintr.\n\nThis video is a mix of IRL vlog style content, and in game Minecraft content. Both showing off the house. We toured Sapnap's office and room, George's office and room, and the rest of the house!\n\nThank you guys for all of the love and support! Lots more cool stuff to come, another Titan Minecraft Manhunt is hopefully the next video! Comment down below ideas :)",

Both showing off the house. We toured Sapnap's office and room, George's office and room, and the rest of the house!\n\nThank you guys for all of the love and support! Lots more cool stuff to come, another Titan Minecraft Manhunt is hopefully the next video! Comment down below ideas :)"

            "description": "We've had booing during anthems at NHL games and other sporting events for weeks leading up to the Four Nations Face-off. One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!",

                "description": "We've had booing during anthems at NHL games and other sporting events for weeks leading up to the Four Nations Face-off. One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!"

Use code BLACKTAIL at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: http://incogni.com/blacktail\n\nUPDATE: I now have evidence that the scammer I have been talking to is the same person(s) that scammed Teresa in this video. After giving her the table she posted the three of us with the table on Facebook. Shortly after, my scammer sent me her Facebook photo and said that was the table he built for me.

            "description": "Kylie’s back for a very special, supersized Valentine’s Day episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Cheerios and is joined by her first-ever male guest: her husband of seven years and Valentine: Jason Kelce. \n\nIn honor of this lovely occasion, we needed an entire hour to get to the bottom of who between Kylie and Jason is the LEAST romantic, where they actually went on their second official date and the hilarious moment that has Kylie crying laughing retelling the story.\n\nThe Kelces also talk about their “babymoon” in New Orleans, including the best foods they ate and that viral photo of Kylie housing a bag of cheetos in the suite during the Super Bowl.\n\nKylie and Jason then get honest about Valentine’s Day as a couple and as parents. They get into how they’ve celebrated in the past, their love languages and what traditions they now have with the girls.\n\nThen, in honor of their 7-ish years of marriage, Kylie and Jason answer 7-ish couples questions from the NGLers. They get into the best marriage advice they’ve ever received, the best gifts they’ve ever gotten each other, and whether or not they’d allow their daughters to date a football player when they’re older.\n\nAfter that, because no couples episode is complete without a game, Jason and Kylie play a game of “Pop Culture Trivia Off: The Battle For Who Knows the Least.” Kylie and Jason both admittedly don’t know much about current pop culture so they put their (lack of) knowledge to the test.\n\nMake sure you tune in to More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for a very special weird pregnancy cravings taste test!

In this video we get a shipment of steel coils then cut the steel so it can be pressed into the shapes for a drawer and for the tool box itself.

            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \n\nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \n\nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\nhttps://www.welcometoberk.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon",

                "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \n\nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \n\nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \nWebsite: https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/\nhttps://www.welcometoberk.com/\n#HowToTrainYourDragon"

Generation, der sein Leben damit verbracht hat, auf dem Bauernhof seiner Familie anzubauen, zu arbeiten und zu lernen. Sein Witz und sein trockener Sinn für Humor sprechen Kinder und Erwachsene gleichermaßen an. Als Produkt der Millennial-Generation verbindet sich seine Wertschätzung für neue Technologien mit seiner altmodischen Arbeitsmoral und er verfügt über die einzigartige Fähigkeit, seine Botschaft auf eine Weise zu vermitteln, die sowohl bei langjährigen Landwirten als auch bei jenen Anklang findet, die keine Ahnung von Landwirtschaft haben. Angesichts des wachsenden Bewusstseins der Verbraucher darüber, woher ihre Lebensmittel kommen, hat Zach erkannt, dass eine unabhängige Stimme aus der Landwirtschaftsbranche erforderlich ist. Zach fördert aktiv die Landwirtschaft, indem er seine täglichen Erfahrungen in der Landwirtschaftswelt teilt und gleichzeitig Landwirt für Landwirt Bildung vermittelt, um einen gemeinsamen Dialog zwischen Landwirten und der Öffentlichkeit zu ermöglichen. \nFolgen Sie uns \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nBearbeitet von: Becky Johnson"

Son esprit et son sens de l'humour pince-sans-rire plaisent autant aux enfants qu'aux adultes. Produit de la génération du millénaire, son appréciation des nouvelles technologies se mêle à son éthique de travail à l'ancienne, et il offre une capacité unique à transmettre son message d'une manière qui résonne auprès des agriculteurs de longue date ainsi que de ceux qui n'ont aucune connaissance de l'agriculture. Avec la sensibilisation croissante des consommateurs à la provenance de leurs aliments, Zach a identifié le besoin d'une voix indépendante en première ligne de l'agriculture. Zach promeut activement l'agriculture en partageant ses expériences quotidiennes dans le monde agricole tout en fournissant une éducation d'agriculteur à agriculteur pour faciliter une conversation collaborative entre les agriculteurs et le public. \nSuivez-nous \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nÉdité par : Becky Johnson"

Kecerdasannya dan selera humornya yang datar menarik bagi anak-anak dan orang dewasa. Sebagai produk generasi milenial, apresiasinya terhadap teknologi baru berpadu dengan etos kerja kuno, dan ia menawarkan kemampuan unik untuk menyampaikan pesannya dengan cara yang sesuai dengan petani seumur hidup maupun mereka yang tidak memiliki pengetahuan tentang pertanian. Dengan meningkatnya kesadaran konsumen tentang asal makanan mereka, Zach telah mengidentifikasi perlunya suara independen dari garis depan pertanian. Zach secara aktif mempromosikan pertanian dengan berbagi pengalaman sehari-harinya di dunia pertanian sambil memberikan pendidikan dari petani ke petani untuk membantu memfasilitasi percakapan kolaboratif antara petani dan masyarakat. \nIkuti \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nDiedit Oleh: Becky Johnson"
