The tournament has started on February 19 and the Indian team has started its campaign from February 20. A total of 8 teams have been divided into two groups. The first group includes India, Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. At the same time, the second group includes teams from South Africa, Afghanistan, Australia and England. The final match of the tournament will be held on March 9. The Indian team has won its first match against Bangladesh by 6 wickets. The great match between India and Pakistan will be played in Dubai on February 23. After this, the Indian team will play the third and last match of the group stage against New Zealand on March 2. The top-2 teams of both the groups will qualify for the semi-finals. But before the challenge of Pakistan, the Indian cricket team has made a good start as soon as it won over the Bangladesh cricket team. After this victory, a wave of happiness also ran among the Indian cricket fans. What did the Indian fans say after Bangladesh's defeat? How eager are Indian fans for the upcoming India vs Pakistan match? Why are Indian cricket fans issuing warnings to Pakistan cricket team? Why do Bangladesh cricket team fans now want to defeat Pakistan cricket team? Why are Bangladeshi fans angry with their captain Nazmul Hossain Shanto?

The tournament has started on February 19 and the Indian team has started its campaign from February 20. A total of 8 teams have been divided into two groups. The first group includes India, Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. At the same time, the second group includes teams from South Africa, Afghanistan, Australia and England. The final match of the tournament will be held on March 9. The Indian team has won its first match against Bangladesh by 6 wickets. The great match between India and Pakistan will be played in Dubai on February 23. After this, the Indian team will play the third and last match of the group stage against New Zealand on March 2. The top-2 teams of both the groups will qualify for the semi-finals. But before the challenge of Pakistan, the Indian cricket team has made a good start as soon as it won over the Bangladesh cricket team. After this victory, a wave of happiness also ran among the Indian cricket fans. What did the Indian fans say after Bangladesh's defeat? How eager are Indian fans for the upcoming India vs Pakistan match? Why are Indian cricket fans issuing warnings to Pakistan cricket team? Why do Bangladesh cricket team fans now want to defeat Pakistan cricket team? Why are Bangladeshi fans angry with their captain Nazmul Hossain Shanto?

The tournament has started on February 19 and the Indian team has started its campaign from February 20. A total of 8 teams have been divided into two groups. The first group includes India, Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. At the same time, the second group includes teams from South Africa, Afghanistan, Australia and England. The final match of the tournament will be held on March 9. The Indian team has won its first match against Bangladesh by 6 wickets. The great match between India and Pakistan will be played in Dubai on February 23. After this, the Indian team will play the third and last match of the group stage against New Zealand on March 2. The top-2 teams of both the groups will qualify for the semi-finals. But before the challenge of Pakistan, the Indian cricket team has made a good start as soon as it won over the Bangladesh cricket team.

How eager are Indian fans for the upcoming India vs Pakistan match? Why are Indian cricket fans issuing warnings to Pakistan cricket team?

The mega drama boasts a star-studded cast led by Wahaj Ali and Maya Ali. Written by the renowned Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar and directed by the acclaimed Haseeb Hasan, Sunn Mere Dil promises to be a one-of-a-kind drama.\n\nSunn Mere Dil is a tale in which love finds a new meaning, where one person’s devotion quietly flourishes, often unnoticed. Their heart beats for someone who may never truly understand the depth of their feelings. Yet, in their silent sacrifices, they realize that true love is not about\npossession but about selflessness.\n\nEvery unspoken gesture and unseen act of kindness brings them fulfillment, as they put their beloved’s happiness above their own, showing that love is not just about being together, it’s about redefining happiness, even at the expense of their contentment.\n\n7th Sky Entertainment Presentation\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nDirector: Haseeb Hasan\nWriter: Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar\n\nCast:\nWahaj Ali as Bilal Abdullah \nMaya Ali as Sadaf\nUsama Khan as Ammar\nHira Mani as Hamsha\nAmar Khan as Dania\nSaba Hameed as Farzana\nSyed Mohammed Ahmed as Namdaar\nShahvir Kadwani as Zaviyaar\n\n#glowingmomentsbylux\n#HappilacPaints \n#colorsofhappiness \n#Ujoobabeautycream\n\n\n#SunnMeraDil\n#WahajAli\n#MayaAli",

Written by the renowned Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar and directed by the acclaimed Haseeb Hasan, Sunn Mere Dil promises to be a one-of-a-kind drama.\n\nSunn Mere Dil is a tale in which love finds a new meaning, where one person’s devotion quietly flourishes, often unnoticed. Their heart beats for someone who may never truly understand the depth of their feelings. Yet, in their silent sacrifices, they realize that true love is not about\npossession but about selflessness.\n\nEvery unspoken gesture and unseen act of kindness brings them fulfillment, as they put their beloved’s happiness above their own, showing that love is not just about being together, it’s about redefining happiness, even at the expense of their contentment.\n\n7th Sky Entertainment Presentation\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nDirector: Haseeb Hasan\nWriter: Khalil Ur Rehman Qamar\n\nCast:\nWahaj Ali as Bilal Abdullah \nMaya Ali as Sadaf\nUsama Khan as Ammar\nHira Mani as Hamsha\nAmar Khan as Dania\nSaba Hameed as Farzana\nSyed Mohammed Ahmed as Namdaar\nShahvir Kadwani as Zaviyaar\n\n#glowingmomentsbylux\n#HappilacPaints \n#colorsofhappiness \n#Ujoobabeautycream\n\n\n#SunnMeraDil\n#WahajAli\n#MayaAli"
