The brand new teaser is now here and throughout this video we're gonna be talking about the characters, plot and all the things connected to Spider-mans big web.\n\nNow the film is gonna be the first of three Sony Marvel movies to release next year with the others being Kraven and Venom 3. Beyond The Spider-verse was originally meant to release then too but theyre just taking their time with it to make it the best film possible. Its totally fair enough and I am curious to see how things go with this movie. It's gonna be heavily rooted in time travel and early leaks were saying that it's basically Terminator but with Peter Parker instead of John Connor.\n\nEither way we're gonna be going through it all and if you enjoy the video then please hit the thumbs up. Don't forget to subscribe for breakdowns like this every day and with that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into Madam Web.\n\n-\n\nNow the teaser begins with something we'll talk about in just a bit but it basically shows how events throughout the film will be repeated throughout. It has web entering a diner where shes united with the heroes of the film before theyre all attacked and killed by an evil version of spider-man. From here we jump to a week prior where we see her working as a paramedic. She almost dies when doing this and is sent over the edge of a bridge on a car. Nearly drowning we see certain clips in her visions and these include her standing infront of a spiders web in a tree. There's also a shot of someone holding a baby and then passing this on. Theres also her falling into the water and im guessing that these are visions of the future which will happen throughout the film.",

The brand new teaser is now here and throughout this video we're gonna be talking about the characters, plot and all the things connected to Spider-mans big web.\n\nNow the film is gonna be the first of three Sony Marvel movies to release next year with the others being Kraven and Venom 3. Beyond The Spider-verse was originally meant to release then too but theyre just taking their time with it to make it the best film possible. Its totally fair enough and I am curious to see how things go with this movie. It's gonna be heavily rooted in time travel and early leaks were saying that it's basically Terminator but with Peter Parker instead of John Connor.\n\nEither way we're gonna be going through it all and if you enjoy the video then please hit the thumbs up. Don't forget to subscribe for breakdowns like this every day and with that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into Madam Web.\n\n-\n\nNow the teaser begins with something we'll talk about in just a bit but it basically shows how events throughout the film will be repeated throughout. It has web entering a diner where shes united with the heroes of the film before theyre all attacked and killed by an evil version of spider-man. From here we jump to a week prior where we see her working as a paramedic. She almost dies when doing this and is sent over the edge of a bridge on a car. Nearly drowning we see certain clips in her visions and these include her standing infront of a spiders web in a tree. There's also a shot of someone holding a baby and then passing this on. Theres also her falling into the water and im guessing that these are visions of the future which will happen throughout the film."

But she soon becomes their only hope for survival when the tyrannical Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) and his cruel emissary, Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), discover the farmers have unwittingly sold their crops to the Bloodaxes (Cleopatra Coleman and Ray Fisher) — leaders of a fierce group of insurgents hunted by the Motherworld.\n\nTasked with finding fighters who would risk their lives to defend the people of Veldt, Kora and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a tenderhearted farmer naive in the realities of war, journey to different worlds in search of the Bloodaxes, and assemble a small band of warriors who share a common need for redemption along the way: Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a pilot and gun for hire; General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a legendary commander; Nemesis (Doona Bae), a master swordswoman; Tarak (Staz Nair), a captive with a regal past; and Milius (E.

On pace for a 56 goal season and a full month under his belt, the kids starting let out his inner DAWG! In todays game against the Florida Panthers, he scored what in my opinion was his most impressive goal yet! I cover it all in todays NHL hockey video! \n\n#hockey #nhl #highlights #chicagoblackhawks #floridapanthers"

Thanks Buffer!\n\nAdditional Animation: \nMatthew Lei ​⁠@lei_doodles \n\n\nUnderstimulated into boredom or overstimulated to a point where you can't focus- ADHD makes conversations tricky. I tried to put my own thoughts under the microscope to help others understand why I can never finish a story and how I can't remember things we talked about 5 minutes ago.\n\nThis was made for Buffer Film Festival 2023. Thank you to the wonderful people at Buffer for everything :)\n\n\nFun Links And Stuff:\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/vas3rVJ\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GingerPale\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thegingerpale/"

According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” said Mann. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, “Inside Out 2” releases only in theaters Summer 2024.",

                "description": "This episode, the brand-new 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse races everything. In the manual-transmission corner, it's the 2024 Lotus Emira, the 2023 Toyota GR Supra 6MT, and the 2023 BMW M2!\n\nAnd then there are the automatic contenders: the 10-speed Chevy Camaro SS and the 8-speed Dodge SRT Challenger Scat Pack Wide Body Shakedown Last Call.\n\n=\nThis episode is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n\nRent Erik's Camaro SS here: https://tinyurl.com/ycky73h9 \nThanks, Erik!\n=\n\nAfter this year, the muscle car is gone — the Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger will be no more. The S650-chassis Ford Mustang remains the only muscle-car (or pony-car) game in town. So we lined up the Dark Horse S650, with its 6-speed Tremec manual transmission and ultra-grippy Pirelli Trofeo RS tires, for a drag race against the brand-new Lotus Emira and two BMWs: the B58-powered Toyota GR Supra 6-speed manual and the S58-powered twin-turbo BMW M2.\n\nThe results may surprise you!\n\n===\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.
