            "description": "How To Train Your Dragon - In Theaters June 13\n\nFrom three-time Oscar® nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation’s acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. \nOn the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \n\nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village’s quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar® nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX® Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX® technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell’s New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award® nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HowToTrainYourDragon \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/httydragon\nX: https://x.com/httydragon\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@httydragon \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures \n#HowToTrainYourDragon",

A MINECRAFT MOVIE coming April 4, 2025. Only in theaters.\n \nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. \n \nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge. \n \nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival! Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, blocky wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. \n \nOscar nominee Hess (“Ninety-Five Senses,” “Nacho Libre”) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing. \n \nThe director’s creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (“127 Hours,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “The Meg”), editor James Thomas (“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu”, the “Borat” films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (“The Jungle Book,” “The Batman”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“The Meg,” “What We Do in the Shadows”). Casting is by Rachel Tenner. The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (“Thor: Ragnarok,” the “LEGO®” movies). \n \nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Mojäng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, “A Minecraft Movie.” The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025. \n \nCredits not final, subject to change",

            "description": "Journey with me on a full tour inside my two-story, giant rainforest vivarium called Pantdora and Orchadia. The rainforest will be hitting its 1 year anniversary next month, so I felt it was the perfect time to do a complete tour of the lands, its creatures, and updates.

            "description": "Brasil parece no poder encontrar su rumbo y, después de haber logrado dos victorias en la última doble fecha, se tuvo que contentar con un empate por 1-1 ante Venezuela, en el marco de las Eliminatorias Sudamericanas.\n\nDesde el inicio, el Scratch parecía más decidido a romper el cero en el marcador. Así, la acumulación de chances en favor del equipo de Dorival Junior se hacía presente, incluso con un remate en el palo de Vinicius que, tras el rebote, Gerson no pudo enviar al fondo de la red.\n\nVenezuela resistía, pero los errores desde el fondo en Brasil le presentaban oportunidades. Sin embargo, la falta de puntería también se hizo presente en la Vinotinto que, si no se encontraba con la humanidad de Ederson, tampoco le embocaba al arco. De todas maneras, el primer tiempo era de ida y vuelta y los 22 jugadores dentro del campo de juego entretenían a los presentes.\n\nLa igualdad finalmente se rompería sobre el final del primer tiempo, de la mano de un potente tiro libre de Raphinha a los 42 minutos que logró engañar a Rafael Romo, quien no logró contener el remate a pesar de que el mismo fue hacia su palo. La reacción de los locales no tardó en aparecer y un centro frontal encontró a Salomón Rondón, pero el capitán del equipo de Fernando Batista no pudo rematar con comodidad y su intento quedó en las manos de Ederson.\n\nEl vértigo persistió en el segundo tiempo ya que, antes del minuto de juego, Telasco Segovia conectó un lindo centro atrás de Jefferson Savarino para romperle el arco a Ederson y poner las cosas 1-1 en el marcador, para el delirio de los hinchas locales. La alegría, sin embargo, duró poco ya que, a los 13 minutos, una infracción sobre Vinícius en el borde del área fue sancionada con un penal -VAR mediante- para Brasil. De todas maneras, para fortuna del equipo del Bocha Batista, el delantero de Real Madrid malogró su intento desde los 12 pasos y también en el rebote, luego de que Romo evite la caída de su valla.\n\nLa expulsión de Alexander González sobre el final del partido amagó con generar espacios para que Brasil encuentre la victoria, pero poco tiempo quedaba en el reloj para que el Scratch consiga el gol de la diferencia. Así, las cosas terminaron 1-1 en Maturín, un empate que dejó a Brasil en el tercer puesto de las Eliminatorias con 17 unidades, mientras que Venezuela se consolida, momentáneamente, en el 7° puesto con 12 unidades, en zona de repechaje.\n\nAhora, el equipo de Batista vistará a Chile el próximo 19 de noviembre para cerrar la doble fecha, mientras que los brasileños recibirán a Uruguay en el último partido de la jornada, el mismo día.\n\nPara más información, visitá http://www.tycsports.com",

The all-new espionage thriller opens in theaters nationwide April 11, 2025.\n\nCharlie Heller (Malek) is a brilliant, but deeply introverted decoder for the CIA working out of a basement office at headquarters in Langley whose life is turned upside down when his wife is killed in a London terrorist attack. When his supervisors refuse to take action, he takes matters into his own hands, embarking on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible, his intelligence serving as the ultimate weapon for eluding his pursuers and achieving his revenge. The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, Danny Sapani, and Laurence Fishburne. “The Amateur” is directed by James Hawes. The screenplay is by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli based on the novel by Robert Littell. The film is produced by Hutch Parker, p.g.a., Dan Wilson, p.g.a., Rami Malek, Joel B.

Beatles ’64 presents the spectacle, but also tells a more intimate behind the scenes story, capturing the camaraderie of John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they experienced unimaginable fame.\n\nThe film includes rare footage filmed by pioneering documentarians Albert and David Maysles, beautifully restored in 4K by Park Road Post in New Zealand. The live performances from The Beatles’ first American concert at the Washington, DC Coliseum and their Ed Sullivan appearances were demixed by WingNut Films and remixed by Giles Martin. Spotlighting this singular cultural moment and its continued resonance today, the music and footage are augmented by newly filmed interviews with Paul and Ringo, as well as fans whose lives were transformed by The Beatles.\n\nBeatles ’64 is directed by David Tedeschi and produced by Martin Scorsese, Margaret Bodde, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison, Sean Ono Lennon, Jonathan Clyde, and Mikaela Beardsley, with Jeff Jones and Rick Yorn serving as executive producers.\n\n@johnlennon @PaulMcCartney @GeorgeHarrisonOfficial @ringostarr",
