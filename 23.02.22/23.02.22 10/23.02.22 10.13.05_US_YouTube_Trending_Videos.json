            "description": "Some Washington D.C. lawmakers want to limit Wall Street's role in the housing market. In recent years, a small but mighty group of corporations bought hundreds of thousands of homes in sunbelt-region suburbs. These homes are traditionally a crucial investment for American families. But rising home prices are shutting would-be homebuyers out of the market.  Meanwhile, financial groups are profiting from rising rents while their subsidiaries build small amounts of new standalone homes in the U.S.\n\nSince the early 2010s, Tricon Residential, Progress Residential, American Homes 4 Rent, Invitation Homes have each bought thousands of homes. They've also added to the housing supply in some cases with built-for-rent communities.Some of these companies are financed by private equity firms like Blackstone and investment managers like Pretium Partners.\n\n\"It's almost a captive market\" said Jordan Ash, director of Labor-Jobs and Housing at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. \"They've been very explicit about how people are shut out of the homebuying market and are going to be perpetual renters.\"\n\nThese calls come after fierce housing inflation hit many Sun Belt states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia, according to the National Association of Realtors. \n\nBy 2030, the institutions may hold some 7.6 million homes, or more than 40% of all single-family rentals on the market, according to the 2022 forecast by MetLife Investment Management.\n\nWatch the video above to learn about the rise and future of corporate landlords in the United States.\n\nChapters: \n01:28 — Chapter 1: Landlords\n05:02 — Chapter 2: Housing stock\n07:55 — Chapter 3: Homebuying \n09:46 — Chapter 4: Solutions \n\nProduced by: Carlos Waters\nSupervising Producer: Lindsey Jacobson\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\nAdditional Production by: Bryan Rager\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

It is Rebecca’s favorite movie, and it’s admired by so many for its portrayal of neurodivergent and autistic people.

            "description": "One man was killed and four others were injured when a gunman started shooting near the St. Charles Avenue Carnival parade route in New Orleans on Sunday.\n\nThe Krewe of Bacchus was close to the end when gunshots rang out near St. Charles Avenue and Terpsichore Street. New Orleans police say the shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. in front of the Hoshun Restaurant, just steps from where a large crowd lined the street enjoying the Mardi Gras festivities.\n\nThe shooting injured a young girl, a woman, and three men. All five victims were taken to a hospital where one of the men later died.\n\n\"We don't know what happened prior to that, but we did hear gunshots and our officers responded as well as other agencies very quickly. And we were able to find two weapons on scene and also apprehend what we believe to be the shooter,\" NOPD Deputy Chief Hans Ganthier said.\n\nAn eyewitness told WWL-TV that at least a dozen shots were fired and that people were falling all over themselves trying to get out of the way, leaving everything they had behind them. He said prior to the shooting, there was a set of skirmishes in the same area that officers broke up.\n\n\"Everyone ran. Everyone took cover. My whole family ducked. I kind of just hovered over my family, like the small children,\" Andrew Crawford said.\n\nThe Bacchus parade was temporarily halted in the 1500 block of St. Charles Avenue after the shooting. An officer said that the parade would resume to \"get out of the way\" of the crime scene but that they wouldn't throw anything while in that area.\n\n\n\"This is not something we wanted to see. We really wanted to be a safe Mardi Gras and we continue to work toward that end,\" Ganthier said.\n\nThe police department could not say if the man they took into custody was the sole shooter on the parade route. The shooting remains under investigation.\n\nThe NOPD is asking anyone with information about the shooting to call Crimestoppers of Greater New Orleans at 504-822-1111.",

This was super intense and really funny.\n\nthis is minecraft speedrunner vs hunter aka minecraft manhunt but theres a twist, it's not modded. I have a custom minecraft plugin that gave me OP kits with enchants. this is minecraft manhunt challenge popularized by dream, this is not a minecraft but challenge or a minecraft smp video. this is inspired by creators like bubbo, boosfer, yellowool, kier and dev, dream, and wilbur soot\n\nThumbnail still inspired by @Boosfer \nEdited by https://twitter.com/SquareAppleMC\n\n#Minecraft #MinecraftManhunt #Manhunt #Baablu",

This was super intense and really funny.\n\nthis is minecraft speedrunner vs hunter aka minecraft manhunt but theres a twist, it's not modded. I have a custom minecraft plugin that gave me OP kits with enchants. this is minecraft manhunt challenge popularized by dream, this is not a minecraft but challenge or a minecraft smp video. this is inspired by creators like bubbo, boosfer, yellowool, kier and dev, dream, and wilbur soot\n\nThumbnail still inspired by @Boosfer \nEdited by https://twitter.com/SquareAppleMC\n\n#Minecraft #MinecraftManhunt #Manhunt #Baablu"

The 82-time winner on the PGA TOUR will be joined by all of the top 30 players in the FedExCup standings, as well as 23 of the top 25 players in the world. These include No. 1 Scottie Scheffler who returned to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking after winning by two shots at last week’s WM Phoenix Open and Rory McIlroy, who finished T10 at last year’s event.

            "description": "Continuing the #Disney100 celebration with this new look at #TheLittleMermaid! Just 100 days until it arrives in theaters!\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n“The Little Mermaid,” visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall’s live-action reimagining of the studio’s Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. “The Little Mermaid” is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton’s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton,” “Snowpiercer”) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca,” “Room”) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Being the Ricardos”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.      \n\n“The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Hamilton,” “In the Heights”), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”), who won two Oscars® for the music in the animated version of “The Little Mermaid,” with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (“Mary Poppins Returns,” “Into the Woods”). Music is by Alan Menken, lyrics are by Howard Ashman and new lyrics are by Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nFacebook: @DisneyTheLittleMermaid\nInstagram: @DisneyLittleMermaid\nTwitter: @LittleMermaid\nHashtag: #TheLittleMermaid",
