This will cause all sorts of problems in Russian-held territory: it will flood the area downstream, it will limit the irrigation of agricultural fields to the south, and it might limit the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant's ability to cool itself. Why is Russia doing this? The straightforward answer is that it will reduce Ukraine's ability to initiate an attack in Kherson, thereby freeing up Russian soldiers to pursue an offensive in the north.

            "description": "Welcome to Sons Of The Forest! The much anticipated sequel to perfectly balanced survival game The Forrest. Similar to that game this one is rammed with various bugs, glitches and exploits that allow you to dupe items and break the laws of physics! Today we will be doing just that by showing one of the fastest and easiest ways to beat the game using just a stick! That's right, this entire 20+ hour game can be beaten with just a stick as sticks allow you to faze through reality. This is rather similar to an exploit in the forest that allowed you to speedrun through all of the locked keycard doors in the game! \n\nToday I will be crossing the entire survival island bypassing the keycard door into the underground lab. Skipping the 3d printing section and going straight for the endgame by sticking my way through the super special final secret door! Sure you might watch a beginer tips and tricks video telling you what to do and how to play the game. Or you could watch The Spiffing Brit explain how to break the laws of reality and bypass all of that fun sons of the forest gameplay with a good old fashion stick take that ign! \n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced memes series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:40 - Crash Landing\n01:55 - We're off on an adventure!\n05:23 - The British Space Program\n08:25 - A Stick-y situation\n10:03 - Thinking outside the box\n11:31 - Spelunking\n14:12 - Finishing the Game\n16:36 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nDisclaimer: I am not sure who first discovered the stick glitch as I am 90% certain I am not the first to learn you can glitch the doors using sticks in both of the games. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\nTitle: How I Beat SONS OF THE FOREST...

            "description": "All roads have led to this. Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso\n\nIn the third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them to finish last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.\n\nSong: \"You Can’t Always Get What You Want\" by The Rolling Stones https://apple.co/YouCantAlwaysGetWhatYouWant\n\nAudio Description Version available: https://apple.co/TedLasso-\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Ted Lasso:\nhttps://twitter.com/TedLasso\n\nFollow AFC Richmond:\nhttps://twitter.com/AFCRichmond\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple TV+\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTVPlus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTVPlus\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

                "description": "All roads have led to this. Ted Lasso Season 3 premieres March 15 on Apple TV+ https://apple.co/TedLasso\n\nIn the third season of Ted Lasso, the newly-promoted AFC Richmond faces ridicule as media predictions widely peg them to finish last in the Premier League and Nate (Nick Mohammed), now hailed as the “wonder kid,” has gone to work for Rupert (Anthony Head) at West Ham United. In the wake of Nate’s contentious departure from Richmond, Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) steps up as assistant coach, alongside Beard (Brendan Hunt). Meanwhile, while Ted (Jason Sudeikis) deals with pressures at work, he continues to wrestle with his own personal issues back home, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) is focused on defeating Rupert and Keeley (Juno Temple) navigates being the boss of her own PR agency. Things seem to be falling apart both on and off the pitch, but Team Lasso is set to give it their best shot anyway.\n\nSong: \"You Can’t Always Get What You Want\" by The Rolling Stones https://apple.co/YouCantAlwaysGetWhatYouWant\n\nAudio Description Version available: https://apple.co/TedLasso-\n\nSubscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTube\n\nFollow Ted Lasso:\nhttps://twitter.com/TedLasso\n\nFollow AFC Richmond:\nhttps://twitter.com/AFCRichmond\n\nFollow Apple TV:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTV\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTV\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTV\nGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTV\n\nFollow Apple TV+\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTVPlus \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTVPlus\n\nMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJ\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

Resulta que hay un error que puede impedir que juegues. Esto solo debería afectar a los jugadores de xbox series x y xbox series s. No podrás conectarte a los servidores de Bungie. Hay una manera fácil de determinar si tiene este error. Si inicia el juego y llega al servidor sin conexión, entonces está listo para comenzar mañana. Si dice conectarse en la parte inferior derecha sin parar, no puede jugar mañana a menos que administre sus complementos. Debes desinstalar jokers wild, penumbra, forsaken annual pass, curse of osiris y warmind y luego guardar los cambios. Te mostraré cómo en este clip. Después de que se desinstalen, puedes salir del juego y reiniciarlo. Si se hace correctamente, ahora debería llegar al mensaje de servidor fuera de línea.\n\nDonate\nhttps://streamlabs.com/cheeseforever\n\nShare Cheese Forever\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/CheeseForever\n\nDirect Subscribe Link\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1M49CAo9u99gABBIqEgDQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nContact Me\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pastuleo23\nEmail: rootbeerpastuleo2@gmail.com\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hJfg8V2Haq\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cheese_forever_destiny/\n\nMerch Shop:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/cheese-forever\n\nBecome A Member\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1M49CAo9u99gABBIqEgDQ/join\n-Members have access to exclusive emojis in live streams as well as a members badge, access to member only video previews occasionally on my community tab, and can add me as a friend on discord.\n\nStreamers I Like\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/arrha_\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/iswype\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amps\n\nPlay Destiny 2 RPG Mobile (I made it myself):\nhttp://d2rpg.weebly.com/\nPreview - https://youtu.be/JPZ9gBRJTeY\n\n\n#CheeseForever #destiny2 #d2",

Resulta que hay un error que puede impedir que juegues. Esto solo debería afectar a los jugadores de xbox series x y xbox series s. No podrás conectarte a los servidores de Bungie. Hay una manera fácil de determinar si tiene este error. Si inicia el juego y llega al servidor sin conexión, entonces está listo para comenzar mañana. Si dice conectarse en la parte inferior derecha sin parar, no puede jugar mañana a menos que administre sus complementos. Debes desinstalar jokers wild, penumbra, forsaken annual pass, curse of osiris y warmind y luego guardar los cambios. Te mostraré cómo en este clip. Después de que se desinstalen, puedes salir del juego y reiniciarlo. Si se hace correctamente, ahora debería llegar al mensaje de servidor fuera de línea.\n\nDonate\nhttps://streamlabs.com/cheeseforever\n\nShare Cheese Forever\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/CheeseForever\n\nDirect Subscribe Link\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1M49CAo9u99gABBIqEgDQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nContact Me\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pastuleo23\nEmail: rootbeerpastuleo2@gmail.com\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hJfg8V2Haq\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cheese_forever_destiny/\n\nMerch Shop:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/cheese-forever\n\nBecome A Member\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1M49CAo9u99gABBIqEgDQ/join\n-Members have access to exclusive emojis in live streams as well as a members badge, access to member only video previews occasionally on my community tab, and can add me as a friend on discord.\n\nStreamers I Like\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/arrha_\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/iswype\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/amps\n\nPlay Destiny 2 RPG Mobile (I made it myself):\nhttp://d2rpg.weebly.com/\nPreview - https://youtu.be/JPZ9gBRJTeY\n\n\n#CheeseForever #destiny2 #d2"

Busch was a strong contender to win the first stage until he suffered a pit-stop penalty which played a role into Busch finishing 12th. Chastain cruised to a comfortable first-place finish. Chastain continued this theme in the second stage where he again finished in first place, followed by Kyle Busch and Joey Logano. However, in the final stage, Busch took it to another level and was able to win the Pala Casino 400. With the victory, Busch holds the all-time record for consecutive cup seasons with a victory at 19 and is now ninth in the all-time victories list.\n\n#NASCARonFOX #NASCAR #Fontana\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from NASCAR on FOX: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOX\nLike NASCAR on FOX on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXFacebook\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXTwitter\nFollow NASCAR on FOX on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/NASCARonFOXInstagram\n\nAbout NASCAR on FOX:\nYour home for NASCAR on FOX, from Raceday to Radioactive and all of the racing action in between.\n\n2023 Pala Casino 400 at Fontana Highlights | NASCAR on FOX\nhttps://youtu.be/ZXJyURa1Cww\n\nNASCAR on FOX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/NASCARonFOX",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n#arctictrain #travel #sweden #norway\n\n00:00 intro/spoilers :)\n00:44 arctic train # 1 🗻\n04:10 world’s largest ice Hotel❄️\n13:57 NORTHERN LIGHTS🤩\n16:22 overnight sleeper train to Stockholm🛌\n24:51 showering on a train💁🏻‍♂️\n26:21 free hotel upgrade thanks to DAILY DROP!🔥\n27:13 Bloops😂",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time traveling! And now we are finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n#arctictrain #travel #sweden #norway\n\n00:00 intro/spoilers :)\n00:44 arctic train # 1 🗻\n04:10 world’s largest ice Hotel❄️\n13:57 NORTHERN LIGHTS🤩\n16:22 overnight sleeper train to Stockholm🛌\n24:51 showering on a train💁🏻‍♂️\n26:21 free hotel upgrade thanks to DAILY DROP!🔥\n27:13 Bloops😂"

                "description": "Today we're watching Ratatouille, part of Pixar's instant classic era of the 2000s. The movie may seem like goofy fun, but does it actually hold up in 2023? Why did they let a rat cook? Would the movie be better if Gusteau was still alive? What's the deal with the ONE noen sign in all of Paris? Can we figure out what Ratatouille actually is?

            "title": "Fixing The Unfixable #2 | Squishy Makeovers from the \"Hopeless Bin\"",
            "description": "Hey guys! Today I attempt to \"Fix The Unfixable\" squishies in my collection. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my \"hopeless bin\" and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!\n\nDON'T FORGET TO GET THE ME PLAYING CARDS:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/p/7422520721599\n\n*available only until March 20th*\n\n________FAQs_________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.
