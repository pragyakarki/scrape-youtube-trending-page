Hosted by 18-time major champion Jack Nicklaus, it is one of the PGA TOUR’s longest-running events at the same venue, having debuted at Muirfield Village in 1976. Billy Horschel returns this week to defend his title from 2022. His four-stroke victory marked his seventh PGA TOUR win last time out. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler also heads to Muirfield Village after finishing tied for third in last week’s Charles Schwab Challenge. He finished just one stroke outside of the Emiliano Grillo and Adam Schenk playoff. Grillo and Schenk will also be competing this week, looking to bring their hot hands to the Memorial Tournament. FedExCup Standings leader Jon Rahm and world No. 3 Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up at Muirfield Village. Rahm won the tournament in 2020 by three strokes. Two-time tournament champion Patrick Cantlay heads back to Ohio aiming to get a third win under his belt, and his close friend Xander Schauffele will aim to grab his first title here after four top-20 finishes in five starts at the Memorial Tournament.

With our never-ending renovations, improvements and gardening we've been doing this spring, we've decided to give our tired and sore backs some help by tag-teaming in a legend in the world of gardening: THE TRACTOR! A 2012 Kubota B26, bright orange tractor with 1800 hours on it to be precise 🤠 That's right, through a twist of fate and a bit of good fortune, we were able to get one recently and it's beautiful. And we need YOUR help in naming it! Please comment your names below! 👇 But first we have to learn how to drive it, use the bucket, backhoe and forklift. This thing turns on a dime, lifts giant payloads with ease, and is generally so much fun to drive that maybe we're going to become the TractorWives?! Okay maybe not just yet, but we're in love with this tractor. Maybe we can even start a new landscaping side-hustle: C&J's Landscaping! Has a nice ring to it, eh? No more walking on sharp rocks, breaking our backs lifting for hours a day. The backhoe mode is kind of the opposite of the lifter mode, and after some trial and error, we were able to plant our first cedar tree with it. For anyone who's never operated a tractor before, it's almost like playing a video game like Smash Brothers, where your button inputs suddenly become backwards. We're so happy! We also checked in on our little seedlings in our green house and are so excited to show you how much they've grown already 🌞 And we're finally creating a pathway for our fruit garden. We can't wait to see what new projects we can complete with our new tractor friend. Give us your name suggestions below, we're going to read them all!\n\nJoin the Patreon Pack HERE!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/vanwives\n\nInstagram: @vanwives https://www.instagram.com/vanwives\nJaz - IG https://www.instagram.com/jazzyjoyy/\nCrystal - IG  https://www.instagram.com/crysdd/\nTikTok: @vanwives https://www.tiktok.com/@vanwives\nTwitter: @vanwives https://twitter.com/vanwives\n\n✉ MAIL ✉ \nPost Office Box 364\nBridgewater PO Main\nNova Scotia B4V2W9\nCanada \n\nBusiness Inquiries \nvanwives@night.co\n\nEdited by Colin Spencer Steingard- https://www.colinsteingard.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOur Journey! How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands. Thank you for being here with us for cabin life, van life and all the in between!\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY SUNDAY 9:30​​​​​​​​ EST 🌞 \n3+ Years of Van life with 2 dogs\nOff- Grid Living at our Cabin in the woods\n\nMUSIC: Brought to you by Music Bed- Elevate your films & projects with better music http://share.mscbd.fm/vanwives​​​​​​​​\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01QAXWPOF9GGI\n\nMUSIC: Brought to you by Music Bed- Elevate your films & projects with better music http://share.mscbd.fm/vanwives​​​​​​​​\n\n#vanlife​​​ #offgrid #farming",

With our never-ending renovations, improvements and gardening we've been doing this spring, we've decided to give our tired and sore backs some help by tag-teaming in a legend in the world of gardening: THE TRACTOR! A 2012 Kubota B26, bright orange tractor with 1800 hours on it to be precise 🤠 That's right, through a twist of fate and a bit of good fortune, we were able to get one recently and it's beautiful. And we need YOUR help in naming it! Please comment your names below! 👇 But first we have to learn how to drive it, use the bucket, backhoe and forklift. This thing turns on a dime, lifts giant payloads with ease, and is generally so much fun to drive that maybe we're going to become the TractorWives?! Okay maybe not just yet, but we're in love with this tractor. Maybe we can even start a new landscaping side-hustle: C&J's Landscaping! Has a nice ring to it, eh? No more walking on sharp rocks, breaking our backs lifting for hours a day. The backhoe mode is kind of the opposite of the lifter mode, and after some trial and error, we were able to plant our first cedar tree with it. For anyone who's never operated a tractor before, it's almost like playing a video game like Smash Brothers, where your button inputs suddenly become backwards. We're so happy! We also checked in on our little seedlings in our green house and are so excited to show you how much they've grown already 🌞 And we're finally creating a pathway for our fruit garden. We can't wait to see what new projects we can complete with our new tractor friend. Give us your name suggestions below, we're going to read them all!\n\nJoin the Patreon Pack HERE!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/vanwives\n\nInstagram: @vanwives https://www.instagram.com/vanwives\nJaz - IG https://www.instagram.com/jazzyjoyy/\nCrystal - IG  https://www.instagram.com/crysdd/\nTikTok: @vanwives https://www.tiktok.com/@vanwives\nTwitter: @vanwives https://twitter.com/vanwives\n\n✉ MAIL ✉ \nPost Office Box 364\nBridgewater PO Main\nNova Scotia B4V2W9\nCanada \n\nBusiness Inquiries \nvanwives@night.co\n\nEdited by Colin Spencer Steingard- https://www.colinsteingard.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOur Journey! How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada. We quickly fell in love with chasing our dreams of adventuring off the beaten path, living off grid and being self sustaining. We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands. Thank you for being here with us for cabin life, van life and all the in between!\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY SUNDAY 9:30​​​​​​​​ EST 🌞 \n3+ Years of Van life with 2 dogs\nOff- Grid Living at our Cabin in the woods\n\nMUSIC: Brought to you by Music Bed- Elevate your films & projects with better music http://share.mscbd.fm/vanwives​​​​​​​​\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01QAXWPOF9GGI\n\nMUSIC: Brought to you by Music Bed- Elevate your films & projects with better music http://share.mscbd.fm/vanwives​​​​​​​​\n\n#vanlife​​​ #offgrid #farming"

Usually this is 30,000,000 blocks out from the center of the world, but on this server this border is only 2,500 blocks out.. And because of this; almost every single resource has been depleted. There are no more ores left Literally. EVERY SINGLE DIAMOND is GONE.. So a revolution was set forth, a call to expand the world border.. Which was the easy part...\n\nContent Creators in This SMP: @Quakitus @WyLL @MugmV2 @Domonoko @McClutch + a lot of the other members, thank you!\n\nBliss SMP Public Discord: https://discord.gg/blisscord\n\nEdited by: Elemental \n\nCredit for the song at 23:30 to @skyboimc \n\nVideos Similar To This:\nMinecraft’s REAL PIRATE Battle Royale - https://www.youtube.com/@Branzy\nHow I Made The World Obsidian - https://www.youtube.com/c/roshambogames\nI Destroyed His House, then Surprised Him with a New One! -https://www.youtube.com/c/planetlord\nThere are 2,000 New Armor Suits.

Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife or DoubleLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on and there is revenge, griefing, stealing, scamming, and war!\n\nSimilar to Parrot / ParrotX2 / Leowook and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP / ajthebolds dog smp / tommyinnit hardcore smp / school smp parrot where he Started a War or Ended a War / LifeSteal SMP series, joined, survived, and I took over the lethal SMP.

                "description": "I Saved The Most Dangerous Minecraft Server...\n\n Most minecraft servers house thousands, even millions of blocks all the way until the world border. Usually this is 30,000,000 blocks out from the center of the world, but on this server this border is only 2,500 blocks out.. And because of this; almost every single resource has been depleted. There are no more ores left Literally. EVERY SINGLE DIAMOND is GONE.. So a revolution was set forth, a call to expand the world border.. Which was the easy part...\n\nContent Creators in This SMP: @Quakitus @WyLL @MugmV2 @Domonoko @McClutch + a lot of the other members, thank you!\n\nBliss SMP Public Discord: https://discord.gg/blisscord\n\nEdited by: Elemental \n\nCredit for the song at 23:30 to @skyboimc \n\nVideos Similar To This:\nMinecraft’s REAL PIRATE Battle Royale - https://www.youtube.com/@Branzy\nHow I Made The World Obsidian - https://www.youtube.com/c/roshambogames\nI Destroyed His House, then Surprised Him with a New One! -https://www.youtube.com/c/planetlord\nThere are 2,000 New Armor Suits. (I got them all) - https://www.youtube.com/c/rekrap2\nPutting An End to The Strongest Players - https://www.youtube.com/c/PrinceZam\nMy Quest for 100 Hearts - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ParrotX2\nI obtained spawn eggs in Survival Minecraft... - https://www.youtube.com/c/Spokeishere\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Not Leowook, RoshamboGames, ClownPierce and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP/ LifeSteal SMP series/ Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2 / season 4. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife or DoubleLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on and there is revenge, griefing, stealing, scamming, and war!\n\nSimilar to Parrot / ParrotX2 / Leowook and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP / ajthebolds dog smp / tommyinnit hardcore smp / school smp parrot where he Started a War or Ended a War / LifeSteal SMP series, joined, survived, and I took over the lethal SMP. This is a lifesteal SMP copy. in Minecraft / Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2, fully produced by Tyrad\n\nSUBSCRIBE...\n\nDiscord Server: https://discord.gg/HNCGfUWg\n\n#minecraft #minecraftsmp #lifestealapp"

The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy.\n\nSubscribe to DisneyMusicVEVO 🔔 for all the latest Disney music videos: https://www.youtube.com/@DisneyMusicVEVO?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow Disney Music: \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic\n\nMusic video by Awkwafina, Daveed Diggs performing The Scuttlebutt (From \"The Little Mermaid\"). © 2023 Walt Disney Records\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/cwVndj",

The area had a large fallen tree in it that I burnt into 3 pieces and rolled out of the way with logs as levers. I may build a hut in this area and so cleared it.\nNext, I dug a pit to mix clay in and collected the new source of clay. The old brick mold (made in a previous video) was used to make 50 bricks that were then allowed to dry. \nWhile this was happening I dismantled the old kiln and used its bricks to make a new one. The new configuration uses only 74 bricks instead of the previous 100, a significantly simpler design. Its firebox is formed by crisscrossing 2 layers of bricks so that air enters in the first layer channels and wood enters the 2nd layer channels at right angles to the first. The new kiln has 3 firing holes instead of the previous 2 of the last design. The new design also has all the bricks stacked on their sides so there is less chance of breakage.\nI fired the bricks and the kiln went ok. There were some cold spots at the top but this may be due to the fact I used less wood than usual, with the firing only taking 2.5 hours (ran out of wood). 3 hours would be better and more wood should be collected beforehand ( a 75x75x100cm pile as opposed to 75x75x75cm pile used this time). The bricks in the coldest area still passed a water test without dissolving though, so it was a success.\nAsh from the firring was made into bricks for storage as they can be used for mortar by calcining (firing in the kiln) later and mixing with sand and water.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
