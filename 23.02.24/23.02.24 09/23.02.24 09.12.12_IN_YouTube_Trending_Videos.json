Despite their hatred towards each other, will Meerab and Murtasim accept their true feelings or will the dynamics of ego and self-respect force them to stay apart?\n\nWriter: Nooran Makhdoom\nDirector: Siraj ul Haq\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nYumna Zaidi as Meerab\nWahaj Ali as Murtasim\nBushra Ansari as Salma\nSohail Sameer as Anwar\nSabeena Farooq as Haya\nHira Soomro as Maryam\nFazila Qazi as Aneela\nFarhan Ally Agha as Waqas\nSeemi Pasha as Sabra\nMahmood Aslam as Malik Mukhtaar\nHaris Waheed\nAgha Mustafa\n\n#terebin \n#yumnazaidi \n#wahajali  \n#JhalakBeautyCream"

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Shailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Bhavya Gandhi / Raj Anadkat). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nRaj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nShailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nNidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nMonika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nSound Recordist: Shakeel Mansuri \nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia"

Dramatic and absolutely unpredictable, C.I.D. has captivated viewers over the last eleven years and continues to keep audiences glued to their television sets with its thrilling plots and excitement.

The series consists of hard-core police procedural stories dealing with investigation, detection, and suspense. The protagonists of the serial are an elite group of police officers belonging to the Crime Investigation Department of the police force, led by ACP Pradyuman [played by the dynamic Shivaji Satam].

Her entire world revolves around her parents and she believes in them the most. Her strong and confident personality makes her stand against social injustices around her.\n\nOn the contrary, Murtasim hails from a powerful and influential family. He respects and values the morals and traditions of his family and refuses to let the family down.\n\nMeerab’s life takes an unexpected turn when she finds out about her family’s decision regarding her and Murtasim’s life. Meerab’s hatred towards Murtasim continues to grow as a family secret from the past resurfaces. Coming from different backgrounds and mindsets, Murtasim begins to realize Meerab’s arrogant behaviour towards him and begins to consider her a challenge for himself. On the other hand, Meerab who is used to living her life on her own terms refuses to accept Murtasim’s family traditions and unnecessary social barriers.\n\nSoon their lives go through a series of emotional sufferings and misunderstandings where it becomes difficult for them to coexist. Despite their hatred towards each other, will Meerab and Murtasim accept their true feelings or will the dynamics of ego and self-respect force them to stay apart?\n\nWriter: Nooran Makhdoom\nDirector: Siraj ul Haq\nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast :\nYumna Zaidi as Meerab\nWahaj Ali as Murtasim\nBushra Ansari as Salma\nSohail Sameer as Anwar\nSabeena Farooq as Haya\nHira Soomro as Maryam\nFazila Qazi as Aneela\nFarhan Ally Agha as Waqas\nSeemi Pasha as Sabra\nMahmood Aslam as Malik Mukhtaar\nHaris Waheed\nAgha Mustafa\n\n#terebin \n#yumnazaidi \n#wahajali",

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Shailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Bhavya Gandhi / Raj Anadkat). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nRaj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nShailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nNidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nMonika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nSound Recordist: Shakeel Mansuri \nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia",

Although I am not that fond of driving through the city traffic during the day, I was grateful to get my hands on this car that has single pedal drive technology and best in class cabin space. It also has 3 drive modes with throttle and steering response- fun, fast and fearless which made our stroll through the city peaceful and the 60+ connectivity features made it so enjoyable!\n\n#XUV400 #MahindraXUV400 #AllElectric #paidpartnership https://mahindraelectricautomobile.com/xuv400",

Although I am not that fond of driving through the city traffic during the day, I was grateful to get my hands on this car that has single pedal drive technology and best in class cabin space. It also has 3 drive modes with throttle and steering response- fun, fast and fearless which made our stroll through the city peaceful and the 60+ connectivity features made it so enjoyable!\n\n#XUV400 #MahindraXUV400 #AllElectric #paidpartnership https://mahindraelectricautomobile.com/xuv400"
