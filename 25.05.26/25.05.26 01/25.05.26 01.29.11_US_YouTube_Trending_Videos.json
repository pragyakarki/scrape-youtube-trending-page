O MrBeast me pediu para construir um troféu para o seu enorme torneio de basquete YouTuber, mas o que ele não sabia é que eu construí secretamente uma sala de jogos escondida dentro do próprio troféu. E isso não é tudo. Meu amigo Airrack tinha apostado que entraria no armazém do MrBeast sem ser pego... então nos unimos para fazer acontecer.\n\nCom a ajuda dos meus amigos e da iluminação RGB incrível do Govee, construímos uma das salas mais secretas de todos os tempos — bem debaixo do nariz da equipe do MrBeast, das câmeras de segurança e de milhões de espectadores de transmissões ao vivo. Você também pode ver o outro lado dessa história no vídeo do Airrack: \"Eu me escondi em vídeos de YouTubers famosos... Ninguém percebeu\".\n\nEsta construção tinha tudo: missões furtivas, disfarces, troféus de 3,3 metros e uma sala escondida que iluminava como uma nave espacial. A parte mais maluca? MrBeast, Mark Rober, FaZe Rug e vários dos maiores YouTubers do planeta estavam a poucos metros de distância, sem a mínima ideia do que estava acontecendo.\n\nSe você está lendo isso, você é um deles!\nComente \"Quero uma sala secreta!\" para que eu possa te notar.\n\nNão, eu construí uma sala de jogos secreta para me esconder da polícia, mas eu construí uma loja gratuita SECRETA para o Sr. Fera, mas eu construí 5 salas SECRETAS que você nunca encontraria, mas eu construí um beliche SECRETO no meu quarto, mas eu construí uma sala de jogos secreta na escola, mas\nEstados Unidos vs. criadores espanhóis!, mas HABLA HISPANA vs. ESTADOS UNIDOS 🏀, mas eu construí uma sala de jogos secreta para me esconder da minha irmã, mas eu construí uma sala de jogos secreta para me esconder da minha mãe, mas eu me escondi em vídeos de YouTubers famosos... Ninguém percebeu, mas eu construí uma sala SECRETA para o Sr. Fera, mas eu construí uma piscina SECRETA no meu quarto, mas passei 7 dias em confinamento solitário ou qualquer outro vídeo como Topper Guild, MrBeast, Zhong, Fede Vigevani, Ben Azelart, thatkidelvis, Fernanfloo, Eladio Carrion, Marlon, Nick Nayersina, Ibai, Chandler Hallow, Mark Rober, Fede Vigevani, Stokes Twins, MrBeast, Ricky Limon, D'Vontay Friga, JuegaGerman, FaZe Rug ou Airrack fariam sucesso.

Anda Tidak Akan Percaya Apa yang Terjadi\nBERLANGGANAN untuk mendapatkan kesempatan memenangkan $1.000! ➔ https://www.youtube.com/c/Mbeem10?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTerima kasih kepada @airrack karena telah berkolaborasi dalam video ini! Selamat kepada Team Beast ( @MrBeast , @MarkRober , @chandlerhallow , @StokesTwins , @rug , @Mar3LG , @NickNayersina , dan @DVontayFriga ) atas kemenangannya melawan Team Fede ( @fedevigevani , @IbaiLlanos , @Fernanfloo , @JuegaGerman , @thatkidelvis , @RickyLimon , dan @EladioCarrion ).\n\n📱 IKUTI MEDIA SOSIAL SAYA 📱\n➽ Instagram - @MatthewBeem\n➽ Twitter - @MatthewBeem\n➽ TikTok - @MatthewBeem\n\nSaya telah membangun ruang permainan rahasia untuk bersembunyi dari ibu, ayah, saudara perempuan saya—bahkan polisi—tetapi kali ini, saya melakukannya ke tingkat yang sama sekali baru. MrBeast meminta saya membuat piala untuk turnamen basket YouTuber besar-besarannya, tetapi yang tidak diketahuinya adalah bahwa saya diam-diam membangun ruang permainan tersembunyi di dalam piala itu sendiri. Dan itu belum semuanya. Teman saya, Airrack, bertaruh untuk menyelinap ke gudang MrBeast tanpa ketahuan... jadi kami bekerja sama untuk mewujudkannya.\n\nDengan bantuan teman-teman saya dan pencahayaan RGB Govee yang gila, kami membangun salah satu ruang rahasia paling luar biasa yang pernah ada—tepat di bawah hidung tim MrBeast, kamera keamanan, dan jutaan pemirsa streaming langsung. Anda juga dapat melihat sisi lain dari cerita ini dalam video Airrack: \"Saya Bersembunyi di Video YouTuber Terkenal... Tidak Ada yang Menyadarinya.\"\n\nBangunan ini memiliki segalanya—misi siluman, penyamaran, piala setinggi 11 kaki, dan ruang tersembunyi yang menyala seperti pesawat luar angkasa. Bagian yang paling gila? MrBeast, Mark Rober, FaZe Rug, dan sekelompok YouTuber terbesar di dunia semuanya hanya berjarak beberapa langkah tanpa tahu apa yang sebenarnya terjadi.\n\nJika Anda membaca ini, Anda adalah YouTuber sungguhan!\nKomentar \"Saya ingin ruang rahasia!\" agar saya dapat melihat Anda.\n\nBukan Saya Membangun Ruang Gaming Rahasia untuk Bersembunyi dari Polisi, Tapi Saya Membangun Toko Gratis RAHASIA untuk Mr Beast, Tapi Saya Membangun 5 Kamar RAHASIA yang Tidak Akan Pernah Anda Temukan, Tapi Saya Membangun Tempat Tidur Tingkat RAHASIA di Kamar Saya, Tapi Saya Membangun Ruang Gaming Rahasia di Sekolah, Tapi\nAmerika Serikat VS Kreator Spanyol!, Tapi HABLA HISPANA VS ESTADOS UNIDOS 🏀, Tapi Saya Membangun Ruang Gaming Rahasia untuk Bersembunyi dari Kakak Saya, Tapi Saya Membangun Ruang Gaming Rahasia untuk Bersembunyi dari Ibu Saya, Tapi Saya Bersembunyi di Video YouTuber Terkenal… Tidak Ada yang Menyadari, Tapi Saya Membangun Kamar RAHASIA untuk MrBeast, Tapi Saya Membangun Kolam Renang RAHASIA di Kamar Saya, Tapi Saya Menghabiskan 7 Hari di Sel Isolasi atau video lainnya seperti Topper Guild, MrBeast, Zhong, Fede Vigevani, Ben Azelart, thatkidelvis, Fernanfloo, Eladio Carrion, Marlon, Nick Nayersina, Ibai, Chandler Hallow, Mark Rober, Fede Vigevani, Stokes Twins, MrBeast, Ricky Limon, D'Vontay Friga, JuegaGerman, FaZe Rug atau Airrack akan membuatnya. Ini adalah video di mana Matthew Beem (alias MBeem10) membangun ruang permainan rahasia di dalam gudang MrBeast untuk menyembunyikan Airrack selama turnamen bola basket YouTuber Fede!"

MrBeast me pidió que construyera un trofeo para su enorme torneo de baloncesto de YouTubers, pero lo que no sabía es que yo había construido en secreto una sala de juegos oculta dentro del propio trofeo. Y eso no es todo. Mi amigo Airrack había apostado a colarse en el almacén de MrBeast sin que lo atraparan... así que nos unimos para lograrlo.\n\nCon la ayuda de mis amigos y la increíble iluminación RGB de Govee, construimos una de las salas secretas más extravagantes de la historia, justo delante de las narices del equipo de MrBeast, las cámaras de seguridad y millones de espectadores de la transmisión en vivo. También puedes ver la otra cara de la historia en el video de Airrack: \"Me escondí en videos de YouTubers famosos... Nadie se dio cuenta\".\n\nEsta construcción lo tenía todo: misiones de sigilo, disfraces, trofeos de 3,3 metros y una sala oculta que se iluminaba como una nave espacial. ¿Lo más loco? MrBeast, Mark Rober, FaZe Rug y un montón de los YouTubers más famosos del planeta estaban a solo unos metros de distancia sin tener ni idea de lo que estaba pasando.\n\nSi estás leyendo esto, ¡eres uno de verdad!\nComenta \"¡Quiero una habitación secreta!\" para que pueda verte.\n\nNo construí una sala de juegos secreta para esconderme de la policía, sino una tienda secreta gratuita para Mr Beast, sino construí 5 salas secretas que nunca encontrarías, sino una litera secreta en mi habitación, sino una sala de juegos secreta en la escuela, sino creadores de Estados Unidos vs. españoles, sino HABLA HISPANA vs. ESTADOS UNIDOS 🏀, sino una sala de juegos secreta para esconderme de mi hermana, sino una sala de juegos secreta para esconderme de mi madre, sino me escondí en videos de YouTubers famosos... nadie se dio cuenta, sino una sala secreta para Mr Beast, sino una piscina secreta en mi habitación, sino pasé 7 días en confinamiento solitario o cualquier otro video como Topper Guild, Mr Beast, Zhong, Fede Vigevani, Ben Azelart, thatkidelvis, Fernanfloo, Eladio Carrion, Marlon, Nick Nayersina, Ibai, Chandler Hallow, Mark Rober, Fede Vigevani, Stokes Twins, MrBeast, Ricky Limon, D'Vontay Friga, JuegaGerman, FaZe Rug o Airrack lo harían.

MrBeast попросил меня построить трофей для его масштабного баскетбольного турнира YouTuber, но он не знал, что я тайно построил скрытую игровую комнату внутри самого трофея. И это еще не все. Мой друг Airrack поспорил, что сможет пробраться на склад MrBeast и не быть пойманным... поэтому мы объединились, чтобы это осуществить.\n\nС помощью моих друзей и безумного RGB-освещения Govee мы построили одну из самых невероятных секретных комнат — прямо под носом у команды MrBeast, камер безопасности и миллионов зрителей прямой трансляции. Вы также можете увидеть другую сторону этой истории в видео Airrack: «Я спрятался в видео известных YouTuber... Никто не заметил».\n\nВ этой сборке было все — скрытные миссии, маскировка, 11-футовые трофеи и скрытая комната, которая светилась как космический корабль. Самая безумная часть? MrBeast, Mark Rober, FaZe Rug и куча самых известных ютуберов на планете были всего в нескольких шагах от меня, не имея ни малейшего представления о том, что происходит на самом деле.\n\nЕсли вы это читаете, значит, вы настоящий!\n\nОставьте комментарий «Хочу секретную комнату!», чтобы я мог вас заметить.\n\nНе я построил секретную игровую комнату, чтобы спрятаться от полиции, но я построил СЕКРЕТНЫЙ бесплатный магазин для мистера Зверя, но я построил 5 СЕКРЕТНЫХ комнат, которые вы никогда не найдете, но я построил СЕКРЕТНУЮ двухъярусную кровать в своей комнате, но я построил секретную игровую комнату в школе, но\nСоединенные Штаты против испанских создателей!, но HABLA HISPANA против ESTADOS UNIDOS 🏀, но я построил секретную игровую комнату, чтобы спрятаться от сестры, но я построил секретную игровую комнату, чтобы спрятаться от мамы, но я спрятался в видео известных ютуберов...

Will it work?\nDo Thin Oils Damage Engines - https://youtu.be/IKdhgKUZhPA\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\n\nAfter over 28,000 reported engine failures, GM is recommending thicker oil as a potential solution — but is that really the answer? In this video, we take a deep dive into why so many GM 6.2L V8 (L87) engines are failing, what the actual root causes are, and why a simple oil change is being offered as a fix in some cases.\n\nWe’ll explore:\n1. The manufacturing flaws behind these widespread failures.\n2. How oil viscosity and the Stribeck Curve relate to engine wear.\n3. Whether thinner oils are causing damage in modern engines.\n4. If switching to a thicker oil could actually help protect your engine.\n\nThis isn’t just opinion — we’re digging into the data, published research, and real-world test results to understand the logic behind GM’s service bulletins and what it means for both affected vehicles and the broader debate around oil viscosity. If you’re curious about the science behind engine lubrication, the role of modern manufacturing, or just want to understand what oil you should be using, this video is for you.\n\nRelated Videos:\nDo Thin Oils Damage Engines - https://youtu.be/IKdhgKUZhPA\nGM Engine Recall Motor Oil Geek - https://youtu.be/pbEdr6Q6cKw\n\nReferences:\nNHTSA Recall Report - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCLRPT-25V274-1598.PDF\nGM Recall Details - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCRIT-25V274-6343.pdf\nGM Recall Details 2 - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCRIT-25V274-5347.pdf\nHonda Oil Study (1999) -  https://doi.org/10.4271/1999-01-3468\nHonda Oil Study (2011) - https://doi.org/10.4271/2011-01-1247\nToyota Oil Study (2020) -  https://doi.org/10.4271/2020-01-1425\nLow Viscosity No Fuel Econ Improvement - https://doi.org/10.4271/2019-01-2241\nCorvette Track Prep - https://www.chevrolet.com/content/dam/chevrolet/na/us/english/index/vehicles/2020/performance/corvette-experience/02-pdf/02-pdf/2023%20Corvette%20Track%20Preparation%20Form_081722_v5.pdf\nStribeck Curve - https://profile.iitd.ac.in/~hirani/lec13.pdf\nSilverado Most Dependable - https://www.chevrolet.com/trucks/previous-year/silverado/1500\nJD Power Awards - https://www.jdpower.com/business/awards\n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\nRecommended Books & Car Products - http://amzn.to/2BrekJm\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA",

Tarantulas can live for up to 20 years, they are not toys and should be treated with the same care as any other animal on a film set.\nThe tarantula is an adult 12yo Lasiodora parahybana female called Harley.\n\n#ElectricCallboy #Revery \n\nLYRICS:\n\nHush my darling\nCan you see the \nMidnight sun\nMidnight sun\n\nClose your eyes\nIt’s time to dream\nThe night has come \nNight has come\n\nDon’t be scared\nJust let the darkness\nHold you tight\nHold you tight\n\nTip Tap Tip Tap \nFollow me\nInto the light\n\nI wanna float away\nLeave my body behind\nAnd I deep dive right into\nA world left behind\n\nI can see the scary faces \nThey’re smiling at me\nAnd it feels like they wanna\nBreak out to be free\n\nFaces, I see those faces\nAnd they keep on coming back\nCan you see those\nFaces, the scary faces\nTell me what you want\nWhat you want from me\n\nRevery\nYou took the loneliness away from me\nDon’t wanna feel like a puppet\nI see your leash I’m gonna cut it\n\nAll I need is\nRevery\nYou will forever be a part of me\nDon’t wanna feel like a puppet\nI see your leash I’m gonna cut it \nYou make me feel alive\n\nAnd I cannot get away\nThey are guiding my steps\nMy fear is a secret \nThat needs to be kept\n\nTogether we will face \nWhat is hiding in the darkAnd follow the path \nWhere the nightmares spark\n\nFaces, I see those faces\nAnd they keep on coming back\nCan you see those\nFaces, the scary faces\nTell me what you want\nWhat you want from me\n\nRevery\nYou took the loneliness away from me\nDon’t wanna feel like a puppet\nI see your leash I’m gonna cut it\n\nAll I need is\nRevery\nYou will forever be a part of me\nDon’t wanna feel like a puppet\nI see your leash I’m gonna cut it \n\nYou make me feel alive\n\nI steal all your dreams\nI feed on the light\nFollow my call \nYou’ll be mine tonight\n\nI steal all your dreams\nI feed on the light\nI drown your mind in the dark\n\n(Cause I’ll be fighting you)\nYou will never own me\nCause I’ll be fighting you back\nMe and the faces\nWill put you in places\nWhere all the lights leaving your soul\n\nCannot deny\nYou’re gonna die\nIt’s your time to bow\nDown\nYou’re gonna die\nYou’re gonna die\n\nRevery\nYou took the loneliness away from me\nDon’t wanna feel like a puppet\nI see your leash I’m gonna cut it\n\nAll I need is\nRevery\nYou will forever be a part of me\nDon’t wanna feel like a puppet\nI see your leash I’m gonna cut it"

So, I knocked on the door and didn’t get an answer and the neighbor told me he hasn’t seen anyone here for 3 to 4 weeks. So I decided I would go ahead and get it cleaned up for the neighborhood.

From the technology inside its lightweight handle, just 35mm in diameter, to the Fluffycones™ cleaner head that revolutionises the way that we clean. \n\nBy swivelling around furniture, spinning 360°, and cleaning right up to every edge, the Fluffycones™ cleaner head makes it easier than ever to clean the hard floors in your home.\nOur slimmest format yet, the PencilVac Fluffycones™ cleaner can also flatten to just 95mm. \nReaching under furniture and into awkward gaps.",

Watch the final trailer for Jurassic World Rebirth and get tickets now.\n-----\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@jurassicworld\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jurassicworld\nX: https://twitter.com/jurassicworld\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jurassicworld\nOfficial Site: https://www.jurassicworld.com/\n\nA new era is born. This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

I’ve started to make friends with the roaches... they are actually really nice so its been fun so far aside from the fact that I'm only allowed one nutrigrain bar and a half a water bottle a day. Larri said I can have more food once I start helping him make more adsense! I think I remember what sunlight feels like but im not sure. He says he’s back in his YouTube era, which means I’m not allowed to leave until I edit every single video. If i dont get the video in time he says he will send \"Quenlin Von Blackwell\" to handle me. Don't know who that is and I don't want to find out.",

Even so, we'll still be tackling the mystery of the Void and finishing the plot threads from the original series finale, The Inquisition, alongside new adventures such as The Burger, The Astrological, The Portrait and The Cancellationgation!

This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",
