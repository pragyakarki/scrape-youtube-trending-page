Join us as we explore our small farm in India, enjoying the fruits of our labor with a delightful fruit harvest. We're picking mangoes, coconuts, and dragon fruit, savoring the taste of these homegrown fruits. \n\nI hope seeing these fruit trees kindled some desire in you for gardening and I hope you will also try to grow some plants.

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham.

Susheela, S Janaki, Bombay Saradha, Sakthi Dasan  \nLyrics By : Mugilan, Bharathi Ganesh & Shakthi Shanmugaraja\nMusic By : Kanmani Raja, D.V.Ramani & Shakthi Shanmugaraja\nProduced By : Unique Recording\n\nAmman is the South Indian Goddess of Rain. She is the main South Indian mother/goddess in the southern India. Mari is closely associated with the Hindu goddess Parvati and Durga. \nHer festivals are held during the late summer/early autumn season of Aadi throughout Tamil Nadu and Deccan region, the largest being Aadi Thiruvizha. Devotees offer Pongal that is cooked using earthen pots which are made during the festive season. Rituals such as fire walking and mouth or nose piercing are also practised. Mari in Tamil means rain. Thus she is referred to as Mariyayee or Aathaa. Aathaa means mother or grandmother. She symbolizes sacrifice, motherhood, abundant wealth and good health. \n\nMay Goddess Amman Bless You All !

Devotees offer Pongal that is cooked using earthen pots which are made during the festive season. Rituals such as fire walking and mouth or nose piercing are also practised. Mari in Tamil means rain.

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nNitish Bhaluni / Raj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nSachin Shroff / Shailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nJheel Mehta / Nidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani / Khushi Mali as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder Suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal / Monaz Mevawalla as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah / Dharmit Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak / Kiran Bhatt as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nNavina Wadekar / Monika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia",

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nNitish Bhaluni / Raj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nSachin Shroff / Shailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nJheel Mehta / Nidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani / Khushi Mali as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder Suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal / Monaz Mevawalla as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah / Dharmit Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak / Kiran Bhatt as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nNavina Wadekar / Monika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia"

This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant.

'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble.

They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village.
