            "description": "Watch the brand-new trailer for Tron: Ares and experience it in theaters, filmed for IMAX, October 10.\n \nTron: Ares follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind’s first encounter with A.I. beings. The feature film is directed by Joachim Rønning and stars Jared Leto, Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Hasan Minhaj, Jodie Turner-Smith, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan, with Gillian Anderson, and Jeff Bridges. Sean Bailey, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer, Jared Leto, Emma Ludbrook and Steven Lisberger are the producers, with Russell Allen serving as executive producer.\n\nGrammy®-award winning rock band Nine Inch Nails composed the score for “Tron: Ares,” and today, the band dropped \"As Alive As You Need Me To Be\" —the soundtrack album’s first single and the first official music from the band in five years. Listen to \"As Alive As You Need Me To Be” and view the visualizer: https://nineinchnails.lnk.to/AAAYNMTB. The track is featured in the new trailer for “Tron: Ares.”\n \n“Tron: Ares (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),” featuring all original music by Nine Inch Nails, will be released on September 19 via Interscope Records. The release marks the first-ever film score by the pioneering band, although bandmates Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have composed 20 scores under their own names, winning two Oscars®, three Golden Globes®, a GRAMMY® and an Emmy® in the process.\n \nALBUM: https://NineInchNails.lnk.to/TRONAres\nSINGLE: https://NineInchNails.lnk.to/AAAYNMTB\nLYRIC VIDEO: https://youtu.be/-Sj-FmI5JfA\n\n► SUBSCRIBE to the channel to get notified when new Disney videos are posted: https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneysShows?sub_confirmation=1\n\n► SUBSCRIBE to Disney+ to stream all of your favorite Disney shows and movies: https://www.disneyplus.com/\n\nFollow on social media to get the latest news and announcements from Disney:\n\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disney\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disney/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Disney/\nX: https://x.com/disney\nWebsite: https://www.disney.com/\n\nExperience more stories by subscribing: \n\n/ @marvel\n/ @StarWars\n/ @pixar\n/ @disneyplus",

We hope you enjoy this video and consider subscribing if you do, it really helps us out! 🦾\n\nWe’ve got an action packed video this week as we attended the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game, along with media day and the red carpet show. We saw familiar faces and met a bunch of guys for the first time and got to congratulate them on their All-Star nomination, which was so cool. We had a bunch of interviews and hilarious moments throughout the entire trip, so be sure to stick around to the end of the video!\n\nWe said what’s up and interviewed a bunch of players from both the National League and American League, including; Kyle Tucker, Pete Crow-Armstrong, Aroldis Chapman, Logan Webb, Corbin Carroll, Jacob Misiorowski, Jazz Chisholm Jr., Byron Buxton, Steven Kwan, MacKenzie Gore, James Wood, Jacob Wilson, Brendon Donovan, Ryan O’Hearn, Hunter Goodman, Brandon Lowe, Zach McKinstry, \n\nThank you so much to all of the players for their time, we’re so excited to see how all of them continue to ball out in the second half. Also thank you so much to MLB for giving us credentialed access to talk to the games biggest stars on the biggest stage. Finally, thank you to you all for your continued support ❤️ none of this is possible without you guys and we are so grateful to be able to go on these adventures because of you all. Shoutout to everyone that said what’s up to us on the trip, Atlanta was amazing. Stay tuned as we’ve got a LOT more content coming the rest of the summer💯\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this video and want to see more like it, make sure to SUBSCRIBE!

                "description": "Milo Manheim, Meg Donnelly, Malachi Barton, and Freya Skye are trading zombies and fangs for brutally honest confessions in this episode of “Pass the Popcorn.” Can the ‘Zombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires’ cast handle the heat offscreen as they face a mouthful of shady questions (and popcorn)? With only one pass allowed, nothing is off-limits as they call out each other’s toxic traits, expose cringe audition memories, and reveal the wildest DMs they’ve ever received. Between bites, the co-stars open up about awkward fan run-ins, debate which DCOMs are lowkey overrated, and—spoiler alert—someone admits they’ve never even watched the ‘Zombies’ movies outside of the premiere 👀.\n \nStream ‘Zombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires’ on Disney+.\n \n#MiloManheim #MegDonnelly #MalachiBarton #FreyaSkye #Zombies #Zombies4 #Zombies4DawnoftheVampires #PassThePopcorn #Seventeen\n\n\n♥ SEVENTEEN SHOWS ♥ \nSuperlatives Challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZAtMEFsaoM&list=PLunx6D_le-dIFSyovlbHyhtjiE3yw6DDP  \n17 Questions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1jXlHBKjYg&list=PLunx6D_le-dJq0By0ap5VtVHMATcg3bAX  \nSchooled: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLunx6D_le-dKYSjL6McohDuzJw8aPPIrU\nRead Receipts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhn8qpGh6uU&list=PLunx6D_le-dK0S0Dbp6w_XnTTHvrUJtqv  \nPost It or Ghost It: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNLdpBNRfl0&list=PLunx6D_le-dJDC3sr-picXymXFS6O5lCt   \nBesties on Besties: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SghToGZQHv0&list=PLunx6D_le-dKIw_QbYYHgP3TPbtohV3GU  \nThen vs. Now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCVZSvwbk1w&list=PLunx6D_le-dIhMVNPWLGY6krdL3qlORi1  \nWhat's Cooking? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9b9gmp7RcM&list=PLunx6D_le-dLx3-SaYpPfCIyMpoy8-LZh  \nBestie Picks Bae: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owLomd3QqEQ&list=PLunx6D_le-dI9hebcWWp9a2mFpiO57Ooo    \nSeventeen Firsts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YWMSZENEU8&list=PLunx6D_le-dJM1FMKIW2WmoxdbStHOhEW   \nBullet Journaling w/ Noelle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKbzcjJLRRo&list=PLunx6D_le-dIyyE9bob0DqNB-ioEEsNw4   \n\n♥ Subscribe to Seventeen! http://bit.ly/SUBToSEVENTEEN   ♥\n \n♥ Follow Seventeen ♥\nhttp://instagram.com/seventeen   \nhttps://tiktok.com/@seventeen   \nhttps://twitter.com/seventeen   \nhttps://www.facebook.com/seventeen   \n\n#Seventeen"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

To save up to 40% off plus 4 free gifts go to https://earthbreeze.yt.link/VQK8tYR\n\nAfter being hit by a semi-truck, her life was changed forever. The pain, the recovery, and the limitations that followed made even basic things—like yard work—impossible.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Claimsline Group Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of regulated claims management activities FRN Number is 831196. ***Free Agreement Check refers only to the live soft-credit check completed online to identify your car finance agreements. *Where No Win, No Fee is offered - You pay nothing unless your claim is successful. A fee between 18 - 36% incl Vat applies on successful claims (fee dependant on level of redress secured), and a cancellation fee may apply outside the 14 day cooling-off period. You do not need to use a claims management company to make a claim; you can do this yourself for free by contacting the car dealership or finance provider and if that is not successful you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. We may receive a fee for introducing you to a third party/panel solicitor, this does not affect any compensation you may receive. Where past redress is mentioned Christopher and Joanne Doran were awarded all sales commission they paid plus interest (76% of their premium) through legal action. This differed from the standard FCA guidelines that typically only allowed consumers to reclaim commission in excess of 50% of the premium. However, this represents a single case rather than a systematic comparison of outcomes.",

Registered with the Information Commissioner's Office; registration number ZA059156. You can find our terms of use, privacy policy and our cookie policy here. Claimsline Group Ltd is a claims management company. Any solicitor we recommend you to is an independent professional from whom you will receive impartial and confidential advice. You are free to choose another solicitor. Claimsline Group Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of regulated claims management activities FRN Number is 831196. ***Free Agreement Check refers only to the live soft-credit check completed online to identify your car finance agreements. *Where No Win, No Fee is offered - You pay nothing unless your claim is successful. A fee between 18 - 36% incl Vat applies on successful claims (fee dependant on level of redress secured), and a cancellation fee may apply outside the 14 day cooling-off period. You do not need to use a claims management company to make a claim; you can do this yourself for free by contacting the car dealership or finance provider and if that is not successful you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. We may receive a fee for introducing you to a third party/panel solicitor, this does not affect any compensation you may receive. Where past redress is mentioned Christopher and Joanne Doran were awarded all sales commission they paid plus interest (76% of their premium) through legal action. This differed from the standard FCA guidelines that typically only allowed consumers to reclaim commission in excess of 50% of the premium. However, this represents a single case rather than a systematic comparison of outcomes."

Claimsline Group Ltd jest autoryzowana i regulowana przez Financial Conduct Authority w zakresie regulowanych działań w zakresie zarządzania roszczeniami, a numer FRN to 831196. ***Bezpłatna weryfikacja umowy odnosi się wyłącznie do weryfikacji kredytowej online w celu identyfikacji umów finansowania samochodu. *W przypadku oferty „No Win, No Fee” – nie płacisz nic, dopóki Twoje roszczenie nie zostanie uwzględnione. W przypadku uwzględnienia roszczenia obowiązuje prowizja w wysokości 18–36% z VAT (opłata uzależniona od wysokości uzyskanego odszkodowania), a po upływie 14-dniowego okresu odstąpienia od umowy może zostać naliczona opłata za anulowanie. Nie musisz korzystać z usług firmy zajmującej się zarządzaniem roszczeniami, aby zgłosić roszczenie; możesz to zrobić samodzielnie, bezpłatnie, kontaktując się z dealerem samochodowym lub dostawcą finansowania, a jeśli to się nie powiedzie, możesz złożyć skargę do Financial Ombudsman Service. Możemy otrzymać opłatę za skierowanie Cię do zewnętrznego prawnika/adwokata z kancelarii, co nie ma wpływu na wysokość odszkodowania, które możesz otrzymać. W przypadku, gdy mowa jest o wcześniejszych dochodzeniach roszczeń, Christopher i Joanne Doran otrzymali na drodze sądowej całą zapłaconą prowizję od sprzedaży wraz z odsetkami (76% składki). Odbiegało to od standardowych wytycznych FCA, które zazwyczaj zezwalały konsumentom na zwrot prowizji przekraczającej 50% składki. Jest to jednak pojedynczy przypadek, a nie systematyczne porównanie wyników."

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling!

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 our 112th country!\n3:08 boarding our boat\n4:00 our room tours\n7:09 boat layout\n10:00 first sunset & meal onboard\n14:50 emotional morning…\n18:15 nate’s big moment!!!\n23:03 kara’s first elephant babies!!!\n26:39 afternoon onboard\n28:42 crocs, hippos, baboons, more elephants\n33:11 day 3\n34:53 last and BEST floating game drive\n35:38 elephant charge!\n36:40 swimming elephants and hippos!"

At first, I didn't know exactly what they were looking for, in terms of sonics, but it clicked when I was told what they didn't want: no jazzy renditions of their music. They meant no disrespect to jazz at all, and if you follow the duo's music, it boils down to hard drums and even harder synths. Hybrid drummer Daru Jones, who played on last year's Tiny Desk for the LOX, was the first choice because of his unique ability to mix traditional and electronic drum sounds. He provided the authenticity needed for this set, and everything else fell into place.\n\nThe excitement for the Thornton brothers' return reached its apex instantly as someone in the crowd yelled \"Oh my god!\" at the opening note of \"Virginia.\" There was no lull as the band coasted through \"Keys Open Doors\" and \"Momma I'm So Sorry,\" from Clipse's most celebrated album, Hell Hath No Fury. I found so much to analyze witnessing the dichotomy between Pusha T and Malice up close. Malice is more collected in his movements, intensely scouring the room with his eyes while his brother is much more animated, even letting out a sinister laugh mid-set.\n\nRecorded weeks ago, the two performed songs from their new album, Let God Sort Em Out, for the first time, including a chilling dedication to their deceased parents, \"Birds Don't Sing.\" Before the tears from the crowd could dry, we got the moment we'd been waiting for in \"Grindin'.\"\n\nThe first half of the year in hip-hop hasn't been the most exciting, so the timing of this reunion couldn't be better.

I'm 30 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess.

I was worried that an animation about… well, an animation, wouldn’t be particularly transformative, and might seem just like a worse version of the original media. But I hope you’ll agree that the talented team at @HibernateStudios  knocked it out the park and made something that fits beautifully into the world of TADC!\nYou may know Hibernate from their Minecraft animations for @danbull  and they also did the CG portions of Divide! for us last year.
