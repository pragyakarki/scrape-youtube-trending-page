Bassist Mike Gordon and drummer Jon Fishman also performed for our Tiny Desk (home) concert series in 2020 with guitarist Leo Kottke. And now, finally, we get a full Phish Tiny Desk concert.\n\nThe set began with “Sigma Oasis,” which included a little musical reference to the All Things Considered theme song. The band continued with “Evolve,” a track from its 16th studio album released last week. Before the band’s final song, Anastasio and Gordon warmed up their fingers on tiny trampolines, which likely had the uninitiated scratching their heads. But for fans of this band, it was a clear signal of what was coming next: “You Enjoy Myself,” a song that dates back to the band’s beginnings and can safely be called a Phish classic. In live performances, the jam segment features choreographed bouncing, and the band brought that spectacle right into our office.\n\nAfter, the band ended its set and swerved out slowly through the crowd, singing while giving out high fives. But the audience's applause didn’t stop, so Phish came back out and played two bonus tracks: “Sample in a Jar” and “Chalk Dust Torture.” “When we started the band, we used to practice in a room exactly this size… it was probably smaller,” Anastasio shared. What a gift to get to watch Phish perform in a similarly sized room 41 years later.\n\nSET LIST\n“Sigma Oasis”\n“Evolve”\n“You Enjoy Myself”\n“Sample in a Jar”\n“Chalk Dust Torture”\n\nMUSICIANS\nTrey Anastasio: guitar, lead vocals\nMike Gordon:  bass, vocals\nJon Fishman: drums, vocals\nPage McConnell: keys, vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer/Director: Maia Stern \nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

            "title": "Davis vs Martin FULL FIGHT: June 15, 2024 | PBC on Prime Video",
            "description": "Gervonta “Tank” Davis may not only be the face of boxing, he might also be the world’s best fighter. Davis delivered yet another viral moment, successfully defending his WBA Lightweight World Title by knocking out the previously unbeaten Frank “The Ghost” Martin with a vicious left hand at 1:29 of the eighth round in the PBC Pay-Per-View main event on Prime Video Saturday night, which marked the 100th championship fight night at the historic MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nFighting in his first world title bout, Martin delivered a high-level performance. Davis (30-0, 28 KOs), however, showed once again that he is indeed special.\n \n“Thank you guys for coming out, great event. I appreciate everyone who made this possible. We did it once again. On to the next!” said Davis.\n \nA packed house full of 13,249 were on-hand to witness a masterful performance from Davis. Martin (18-1, 12 KOs) used quick combinations and elite athleticism to bank the early rounds. Davis took his time, opening up in the third round and constantly pinning Martin against the ropes.\n \n“Frank Martin was a great fighter. He put up a good four to five rounds,” said Davis. “I was finding my range. (Martin) had a decent jab and was moving a lot and I just had to break him down as the fight went on.”\n \nThe undefeated three-division world champion applied steady, intelligent pressure, slowly breaking Martin down and setting him up for the highlight-reel finish in the eighth. With Martin backed into a corner, Davis rocked him with a powerful left uppercut followed by a left cross that left Martin flat on his back. As Martin struggled to rise, referee Harvey Dock wisely waved the fight off.\n \n“I knew he wasn’t getting back up because of the way he fell, and I knew he was gonna tire himself out, that was the whole gameplan,” said Davis.\n \n“I’m holding my head high,” said Martin. “At the end of the day, I came out to be great, but I came up short. I got caught with a shot that I didn’t see, one of those shots that comes from underneath and it went from there. I guess I didn’t make the count, but I appreciate everybody that came out, everybody that’s been a part of this event.\n \n“I’ll be back. Going to go watch the film, get better and grow. Y’all will see me again.”\n \nDavis has similar plans. “Now we go back to the drawing board and I want to fight all of them.”\n\n#TankMartin #GervontaDavis #FrankMartin \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

                "description": "Gervonta “Tank” Davis may not only be the face of boxing, he might also be the world’s best fighter. Davis delivered yet another viral moment, successfully defending his WBA Lightweight World Title by knocking out the previously unbeaten Frank “The Ghost” Martin with a vicious left hand at 1:29 of the eighth round in the PBC Pay-Per-View main event on Prime Video Saturday night, which marked the 100th championship fight night at the historic MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nFighting in his first world title bout, Martin delivered a high-level performance. Davis (30-0, 28 KOs), however, showed once again that he is indeed special.\n \n“Thank you guys for coming out, great event. I appreciate everyone who made this possible. We did it once again. On to the next!” said Davis.\n \nA packed house full of 13,249 were on-hand to witness a masterful performance from Davis. Martin (18-1, 12 KOs) used quick combinations and elite athleticism to bank the early rounds. Davis took his time, opening up in the third round and constantly pinning Martin against the ropes.\n \n“Frank Martin was a great fighter. He put up a good four to five rounds,” said Davis. “I was finding my range. (Martin) had a decent jab and was moving a lot and I just had to break him down as the fight went on.”\n \nThe undefeated three-division world champion applied steady, intelligent pressure, slowly breaking Martin down and setting him up for the highlight-reel finish in the eighth. With Martin backed into a corner, Davis rocked him with a powerful left uppercut followed by a left cross that left Martin flat on his back. As Martin struggled to rise, referee Harvey Dock wisely waved the fight off.\n \n“I knew he wasn’t getting back up because of the way he fell, and I knew he was gonna tire himself out, that was the whole gameplan,” said Davis.\n \n“I’m holding my head high,” said Martin. “At the end of the day, I came out to be great, but I came up short. I got caught with a shot that I didn’t see, one of those shots that comes from underneath and it went from there. I guess I didn’t make the count, but I appreciate everybody that came out, everybody that’s been a part of this event.\n \n“I’ll be back. Going to go watch the film, get better and grow. Y’all will see me again.”\n \nDavis has similar plans. “Now we go back to the drawing board and I want to fight all of them.”\n\n#TankMartin #GervontaDavis #FrankMartin \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"

It was my first time in a Yurt and I put together a little video to show what that whole thing is all about. The state parks here rent these out and they come equipped with some basic stuff (beds, seating, lights). Bring your own bedding, food, and cooking supplies. It was a fun night hunkering down! \n\nThe adventure will continue over the coming weeks. Stay tuned! \n\nCheers everyone.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n• Website: https://campingwithsteve.com\n• My Amazon store: https://amzn.to/49li5Az\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGear:\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha FX3\nhttps://amzn.to/3SIMQra\n\nLens: Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G\nhttps://amzn.to/3SL1rm7\n\nEditing: Apple 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Final Cut Pro\nhttps://amzn.to/3YeuCiy\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSocials: \n• Facebook: https://facebook.com/campingwithsteve\n• Instagram: https://instagram.com/campingsteve\n• Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/hunkerdownsteve\n• TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@campingwithsteve\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#camping #hunkerdown #yurt #glamping #campingwithsteve",

                "description": "I am in the US for a month having the adventure of my life. The only way to stay cool and go \"camping\" in Georgia was to rent an air conditioned Yurt. It was my first time in a Yurt and I put together a little video to show what that whole thing is all about. The state parks here rent these out and they come equipped with some basic stuff (beds, seating, lights). Bring your own bedding, food, and cooking supplies. It was a fun night hunkering down! \n\nThe adventure will continue over the coming weeks. Stay tuned! \n\nCheers everyone.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n• Website: https://campingwithsteve.com\n• My Amazon store: https://amzn.to/49li5Az\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGear:\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha FX3\nhttps://amzn.to/3SIMQra\n\nLens: Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G\nhttps://amzn.to/3SL1rm7\n\nEditing: Apple 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Final Cut Pro\nhttps://amzn.to/3YeuCiy\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSocials: \n• Facebook: https://facebook.com/campingwithsteve\n• Instagram: https://instagram.com/campingsteve\n• Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/hunkerdownsteve\n• TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@campingwithsteve\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#camping #hunkerdown #yurt #glamping #campingwithsteve"

            "description": "Get on the Cupid’s Corner dating app, plan dates with fun Sims, and discover what makes Sims swoon in The Sims™ 4 Lovestruck Expansion Pack*, launching July 25 at 10AM PT. Pre-order or buy through September 5 to get the Heartbreak Happens Digital Content**. \n\nFinding dates for your Sims has never been easier. Open the new dating app and create a profile – you’ll take a selfie to use as a profile pic and choose which of your Sim’s traits you want to highlight. Then, browse through your matches! These can include both Sims in the world and Sims from the Gallery.\n\nOnce you’ve matched with a Sim you’d like to spend time with, start planning your date! Choose the location and which activities you’d like to try together. There are a ton of options including classics like dancing and flirting as well as adventurous options like fishing, swimming, or stargazing. You can even invite additional Sims on your date. Friends, potential partners, or even exes (if you like the drama) can all be invited if you want them to be. \n\nWhether your date is hot or not could come down to Sims Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Some of these are physical, like outfit styles or colors, but others come down to interactions and personality. Those you’ll have to discover. Finding a date is easier than ever, but making relationships work? That’s more of a challenge.\n\nIf a date is going poorly, Sims may autonomously decide to leave. \n\nWhen Sims become romantically involved, you’ll be able to see how happy they are in their relationships by checking their Romance Satisfaction. Sims can have different levels of satisfaction; what works for one Sim might not work for their partner!\n\nFinding a partner isn't the end of your love story! Relationships will have dynamics, which can be established through gameplay or set in CAS. Will your Sims maintain Wholesome, loving, relationships or happy Steamy relationships? If partners aren't kind things could get Strained. Sims can even have Unpredictable relationships where they switch gears on a dime! \n\nExplore the fun, flirty side of dating and experience deeper romances in Lovestruck!\n\nAvailable July 25 at 10 a.m. PT on Origin PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation®4, and PlayStation®5.

This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself.\n\nIn season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.\n\nSeason 2 reunites its ensemble cast of stars including Emmy Award nominee Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken and Academy and Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette, and welcomes new series regular Sarah Bock.\n\nSeverance is executive produced by Ben Stiller, who also directs five episodes this season in addition to directors Uta Bresiewitz, Sam Donovan and Jessica Lee Gagné. The series is written, created and executive produced by Dan Erickson. Severance season two is also executive produced by John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Sam Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz, Nicholas Weinstock.

                "description": "Like you never left. \n\nSeverance season 2 premieres January 17, 2025 https://apple.co/_Severance \n\nIn Severance, Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure, which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself.\n\nIn season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.\n\nSeason 2 reunites its ensemble cast of stars including Emmy Award nominee Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken and Academy and Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette, and welcomes new series regular Sarah Bock.\n\nSeverance is executive produced by Ben Stiller, who also directs five episodes this season in addition to directors Uta Bresiewitz, Sam Donovan and Jessica Lee Gagné. The series is written, created and executive produced by Dan Erickson. Severance season two is also executive produced by John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Sam Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz, Nicholas Weinstock. In addition to starring, Adam Scott and Patricia Arquette serve as executive producers.
