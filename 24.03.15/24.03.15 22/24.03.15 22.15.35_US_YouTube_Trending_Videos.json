            "description": "Stephen Thompson | March 15, 2024\nWalking into the room shortly before Justin Timberlake took our cramped stage, I overheard someone on his team wondering aloud if this was to be the most densely populated Tiny Desk concert in history — which is to say, the most musicians we've ever fit in a single frame. It's not, but we don't often find a way to cram in this many human beings (15 in all) and this much gear.\n\nTimberlake has never been one to give partial effort, but this is a production befitting the occasion: namely, a set timed to drop concurrently with the release of his new album, Everything I Thought It Was. Eschewing the rootsier feel of its predecessor, 2018's Man of the Woods, the new record is a throwback, an epic and a blowout — and so's this lavish set, which scales the Timberlake experience down to 25 minutes of maximalist celebration and, when the moment calls for it, chiller vibes.\n\nBacked by his band The Tennessee Kids, Timberlake's Tiny Desk debut leans heavily on his early solo catalog, as he kicks it off with two songs from 2002's classic Justified and weaves in three more from 2006's magnificent FutureSex/LoveSounds — including a set-closing \"SexyBack,\" which finds the singer trotting out a megaphone in a truly meme-worthy moment.\n\nBy the way, in case you're wondering, the all-time record for musicians behind the Tiny Desk is a whopping 23, a feat pulled off by the fantastic Mucca Pazza in 2015. But Timberlake and company rival that classic performance's energy — in both cases, the real triumph lies not in the Tetris of it all, but in the way that many people still find ways to move, buoyantly and as one mighty organism.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Señorita\"\n\"Rock Your Body\"\n\"Pusher Love Girl\"\n\"Until The End Of Time\"\n\"Selfish\"\n\"What Goes Around\"\n\"SexyBack\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJustin Timberlake: lead vocals, guitar, keys\nRaVaughn Brown: vocals\nCamry: vocals\nErin Stevenson: vocals\nKenyon Dixon: vocals\nJustin Gilbert: keys\nMike Reid: drums\nElliot Ives: guitar\nDerrick Ray: bass\nLeon Silva: saxophone\nKevin Williams: trombone, flute\nDontae Winslow: trumpet\nSean Erick: trumpet\nAdam Blackstone: keys, percussion, music direction\nAndrew Hypes: DJ\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Alanté Serene, Elizabeth Gillis\nAudio Engineers: Kwesi Lee, Adam Blackstone, Danny Cheung\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#justintimberlake #nprmusic #tinydesk",

It was also a step forward for the space company making it a success, but far from a complete success as both booster and Starship failed to control themselves all the way to landing, and at least one on Orbit test - the engine relight failed.\nThe starship on orbit failed to maintain attitude during the initial reentry phase and this doomed the spacecraft to a fiery disintegration over the Indian Ocean.\nCongratulations to SpaceX on setting new records - let's get some soft landings next time.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley"

Ok well by brand new I really mean that I took an existingly great format cultivated by @dream  in minecraft and just hamfisted it into the skyrim together mod which has the netcode stability of crumbs. Today The Spiffing Brit (Skyrim Exploiter), Doug Doug (Skyrim Speedrunner), ItsJabo (Skyrim Hater) and Joov (Skyrim Hunter) will have to hunt down and assassinate NPCs, Bandits and humanoids scattered across the holds of skyrim! However if any of the hunters manage to kill one another their score is locked and they must begin hunting down the other players! Whoever has defeated the most humans by the end of the time limit wins! However todays challenge is filled with twists, turns and crashes so who knows what wonderful skyrim multiplayer exploits will be discovered today! So get ready for skyrim together reborn pushed to its limits with all new styles of gameplay memes and challenges for spiff to deal with! Some have tried Skyrim co-op but today we try skyrim pvp! \n\nA huge thank you to @DougDoug, @ItsJabo and @Joov for taking part in todays video.

We got to really explore and adventure around a city and country that has shown me so much love and that means so much to me. YUNJIN and I really had so much fun on set making this video. The vibes the whole day were so warm, the energy was lovely, and all of the people who contributed their love and talent are so deeply appreciated for making this video so fun and special. Most importantly thank you to YUNJIN for truly completing this song and making it such a wonderful piece and thank you to my brother, my friend, and one of my favorite creators and directors in the world Miles Murphy for going on an adventure around the world with me to direct it.

We got to really explore and adventure around a city and country that has shown me so much love and that means so much to me. YUNJIN and I really had so much fun on set making this video. The vibes the whole day were so warm, the energy was lovely, and all of the people who contributed their love and talent are so deeply appreciated for making this video so fun and special. Most importantly thank you to YUNJIN for truly completing this song and making it such a wonderful piece and thank you to my brother, my friend, and one of my favorite creators and directors in the world Miles Murphy for going on an adventure around the world with me to direct it. Grateful for you all. Hope you enjoy this video and so much love to you guys for making this song/album my favorite release experience to date.

            "description": "Maia Stern | March 11, 2024\nWhat better way to spend March 11 than with 311 bringing love and nostalgia to the Tiny Desk. The members of 311, who have been a band together for over 30 years, strolled into NPR HQ and barely needed much rehearsal time before playing four of their most beloved tracks. The band has been performing these songs for decades, and you can tell it all just comes naturally. \"This kind of reminds me of being in my dad's basement, being back next to the pool table, but it smells better here,\" said lead singer Nick Hexum, who felt right at home and back to his roots at our office space.\n\n311's self-titled album came out in 1995 when I was entering my peak angst stage. The songs on that album were the perfect soundtrack to all the pre-teen feelings I wasn't able to fully express myself.

The members of 311, who have been a band together for over 30 years, strolled into NPR HQ and barely needed much rehearsal time before playing four of their most beloved tracks. The band has been performing these songs for decades, and you can tell it all just comes naturally. \"This kind of reminds me of being in my dad's basement, being back next to the pool table, but it smells better here,\" said lead singer Nick Hexum, who felt right at home and back to his roots at our office space.\n\n311's self-titled album came out in 1995 when I was entering my peak angst stage.

And it’s very important to me that even if you’re disappointed, you at least understand what’s happening now and in the future.\n\nThank you in advance for your patience.\nDallas\n---\nWatch The Chosen and find exclusive content free and easy on our app:\nhttps://thechosen.tv/en-us#WhereToWatch\n\nWear The Chosen gear and go deeper with our study materials: \nhttps://thechosengifts.com\n\nSupport The Chosen by donating to the Come and See Foundation: https://www.comeandsee.net/donate\n\n#BingeJesus by subscribing to our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/thechosense...\n\n#GetUsedToDifferent by following us:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsideTheChosen\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thechosentvseries/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thechosentv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thechosentv"

That's why I decided to surprise him with his dream steaming setup! This was absolutely insane to make becuase we had to make this happen with him streaming in the room next door.

            "description": "In the third round of the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard, Rory McIlroy lets one loose, sending his tee shot 365 yards, cutting the corner and landing his ball on the green at the par-4 10th hole, becoming the first player in the ShotLink era (2003) to drive the 10th green at Bay Hill. He would two-putt for birdie.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PGA TOUR’s Florida swing continues as Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club & Lodge hosts the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard. This event is the second of three player-hosted invitationals (along with Tiger Woods’ The Genesis Invitational and Jack Nicklaus’ the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday). ­World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will be in the field this week. The American has gone T4-1-T15 in his last three Arnold Palmer Invitational starts and hasn’t finished worse than T17 in his last five TOUR starts – including three straight top-10s. Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up in Florida this week. He’s had past success here claiming victory in 2018 and finishing runner-up two years ago. The Northern Irishman has also made nine out of nine cuts and claimed six top-10s previously in this event. Reigning FedExCup champion Viktor Hovland is also back in action this week. Hovland last teed it up at The Genesis Invitational where he finished tied for 19th. He has recorded back-to-back top-10 results at Bay Hill, including a runner-up in 2022. Others to look out for are Jordan Spieth, Max Homa, Justin Thomas and Austin Eckroat.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/",

                "description": "In the third round of the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard, Rory McIlroy lets one loose, sending his tee shot 365 yards, cutting the corner and landing his ball on the green at the par-4 10th hole, becoming the first player in the ShotLink era (2003) to drive the 10th green at Bay Hill. He would two-putt for birdie.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PGA TOUR’s Florida swing continues as Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club & Lodge hosts the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard. This event is the second of three player-hosted invitationals (along with Tiger Woods’ The Genesis Invitational and Jack Nicklaus’ the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday). ­World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will be in the field this week. The American has gone T4-1-T15 in his last three Arnold Palmer Invitational starts and hasn’t finished worse than T17 in his last five TOUR starts – including three straight top-10s. Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up in Florida this week. He’s had past success here claiming victory in 2018 and finishing runner-up two years ago. The Northern Irishman has also made nine out of nine cuts and claimed six top-10s previously in this event. Reigning FedExCup champion Viktor Hovland is also back in action this week. Hovland last teed it up at The Genesis Invitational where he finished tied for 19th. He has recorded back-to-back top-10 results at Bay Hill, including a runner-up in 2022. Others to look out for are Jordan Spieth, Max Homa, Justin Thomas and Austin Eckroat.\r\n\r\nCheck out https://www.pgatour.com for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!\r\n\r\nFollow PGA TOUR online:\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pgatour/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PGATour  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR\r\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@pgatour\r\nSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/pgatour\r\n\r\nSign up for exclusive coverage - http://www.pgatourlive.com\r\nPGA TOUR Superstore - http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/"

            "description": "🚨make room for new emotions🚨\n\nWatch the new trailer for Disney & Pixar's Inside Out 2, only in theaters June 14! #Insideout2 \n\nThe little voices inside Riley’s head know her inside and out—but next summer, everything changes when Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” introduces a new Emotion: Anxiety. According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” said Mann. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust.

According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” said Mann. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust.

            "description": "You might remember the legendary song and meme sensation that was crab rave. Well imagine if the creator of that song became a game dev and made a video game where you Claw your way across exotic islands combining fluid movement with fast paced combat to become a Crab Champion in this third person shooter with roguelike elements. Ok you don't need to imagine the game is here and its called Crab Champions. However this is a special game. Unlike most games the developer of this one really wants you to actually break their game. This game wants to be broken. So what makes crab champions so special. This game features stats and skills that can be stacked and modified in a way that lets the player manipulate the gameplay to exploit, glitch and bug your way to becoming overpowered. In this video I will showcase a god mode immortality glitch, an infinite money glitch and an infinite damage glitch. All that and more because this game is oh so perfect for an exploiter like The Spiffing Brit! \n\nYou can currently grab Crab Champions On a steam sale here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/774801/Crab_Champions/\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:46 - Starting our run\n04:15 - Exploiting the shops!\n06:06 - Science with Spiff!\n08:06 - Improving our luck even further\n11:12 - The final biome!\n14:45 - Defeat the boss!\n16:38 - Machine gun crab\n21:29 - Science with Spiff S01E02\n23:43 - The return of King Skull!\n24:19 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.

                "description": "You might remember the legendary song and meme sensation that was crab rave. Well imagine if the creator of that song became a game dev and made a video game where you Claw your way across exotic islands combining fluid movement with fast paced combat to become a Crab Champion in this third person shooter with roguelike elements. Ok you don't need to imagine the game is here and its called Crab Champions. However this is a special game. Unlike most games the developer of this one really wants you to actually break their game. This game wants to be broken. So what makes crab champions so special. This game features stats and skills that can be stacked and modified in a way that lets the player manipulate the gameplay to exploit, glitch and bug your way to becoming overpowered. In this video I will showcase a god mode immortality glitch, an infinite money glitch and an infinite damage glitch. All that and more because this game is oh so perfect for an exploiter like The Spiffing Brit! \n\nYou can currently grab Crab Champions On a steam sale here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/774801/Crab_Champions/\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:46 - Starting our run\n04:15 - Exploiting the shops!\n06:06 - Science with Spiff!\n08:06 - Improving our luck even further\n11:12 - The final biome!\n14:45 - Defeat the boss!\n16:38 - Machine gun crab\n21:29 - Science with Spiff S01E02\n23:43 - The return of King Skull!\n24:19 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.
