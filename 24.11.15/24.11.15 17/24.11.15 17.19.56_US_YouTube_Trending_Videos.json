            "description": "Brasil parece no poder encontrar su rumbo y, después de haber logrado dos victorias en la última doble fecha, se tuvo que contentar con un empate por 1-1 ante Venezuela, en el marco de las Eliminatorias Sudamericanas.\n\nDesde el inicio, el Scratch parecía más decidido a romper el cero en el marcador. Así, la acumulación de chances en favor del equipo de Dorival Junior se hacía presente, incluso con un remate en el palo de Vinicius que, tras el rebote, Gerson no pudo enviar al fondo de la red.\n\nVenezuela resistía, pero los errores desde el fondo en Brasil le presentaban oportunidades. Sin embargo, la falta de puntería también se hizo presente en la Vinotinto que, si no se encontraba con la humanidad de Ederson, tampoco le embocaba al arco. De todas maneras, el primer tiempo era de ida y vuelta y los 22 jugadores dentro del campo de juego entretenían a los presentes.\n\nLa igualdad finalmente se rompería sobre el final del primer tiempo, de la mano de un potente tiro libre de Raphinha a los 42 minutos que logró engañar a Rafael Romo, quien no logró contener el remate a pesar de que el mismo fue hacia su palo. La reacción de los locales no tardó en aparecer y un centro frontal encontró a Salomón Rondón, pero el capitán del equipo de Fernando Batista no pudo rematar con comodidad y su intento quedó en las manos de Ederson.\n\nEl vértigo persistió en el segundo tiempo ya que, antes del minuto de juego, Telasco Segovia conectó un lindo centro atrás de Jefferson Savarino para romperle el arco a Ederson y poner las cosas 1-1 en el marcador, para el delirio de los hinchas locales. La alegría, sin embargo, duró poco ya que, a los 13 minutos, una infracción sobre Vinícius en el borde del área fue sancionada con un penal -VAR mediante- para Brasil. De todas maneras, para fortuna del equipo del Bocha Batista, el delantero de Real Madrid malogró su intento desde los 12 pasos y también en el rebote, luego de que Romo evite la caída de su valla.\n\nLa expulsión de Alexander González sobre el final del partido amagó con generar espacios para que Brasil encuentre la victoria, pero poco tiempo quedaba en el reloj para que el Scratch consiga el gol de la diferencia. Así, las cosas terminaron 1-1 en Maturín, un empate que dejó a Brasil en el tercer puesto de las Eliminatorias con 17 unidades, mientras que Venezuela se consolida, momentáneamente, en el 7° puesto con 12 unidades, en zona de repechaje.\n\nAhora, el equipo de Batista vistará a Chile el próximo 19 de noviembre para cerrar la doble fecha, mientras que los brasileños recibirán a Uruguay en el último partido de la jornada, el mismo día.\n\nPara más información, visitá http://www.tycsports.com",

            "description": "Journey back to 1964 and experience Beatlemania like never before. \n\nFrom producer Martin Scorsese and director David Tedeschi, stream Beatles '64, an original documentary, only on @disneyplus November 29.\n\nThe film captures the electrifying moment of The Beatles’ first visit to America.  On February 7, 1964, The Beatles arrived in New York City to unprecedented excitement and hysteria. From the instant they landed at Kennedy Airport, met by thousands of fans, Beatlemania swept New York and the entire country. Their thrilling debut performance on The Ed Sullivan Show captivated more than 73 million viewers, the most watched television event of its time. Beatles ’64 presents the spectacle, but also tells a more intimate behind the scenes story, capturing the camaraderie of John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they experienced unimaginable fame.\n\nThe film includes rare footage filmed by pioneering documentarians Albert and David Maysles, beautifully restored in 4K by Park Road Post in New Zealand. The live performances from The Beatles’ first American concert at the Washington, DC Coliseum and their Ed Sullivan appearances were demixed by WingNut Films and remixed by Giles Martin. Spotlighting this singular cultural moment and its continued resonance today, the music and footage are augmented by newly filmed interviews with Paul and Ringo, as well as fans whose lives were transformed by The Beatles.\n\nBeatles ’64 is directed by David Tedeschi and produced by Martin Scorsese, Margaret Bodde, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison, Sean Ono Lennon, Jonathan Clyde, and Mikaela Beardsley, with Jeff Jones and Rick Yorn serving as executive producers.\n\n@johnlennon @PaulMcCartney @GeorgeHarrisonOfficial @ringostarr",

                "description": "Journey back to 1964 and experience Beatlemania like never before. \n\nFrom producer Martin Scorsese and director David Tedeschi, stream Beatles '64, an original documentary, only on @disneyplus November 29.\n\nThe film captures the electrifying moment of The Beatles’ first visit to America.  On February 7, 1964, The Beatles arrived in New York City to unprecedented excitement and hysteria. From the instant they landed at Kennedy Airport, met by thousands of fans, Beatlemania swept New York and the entire country. Their thrilling debut performance on The Ed Sullivan Show captivated more than 73 million viewers, the most watched television event of its time. Beatles ’64 presents the spectacle, but also tells a more intimate behind the scenes story, capturing the camaraderie of John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they experienced unimaginable fame.\n\nThe film includes rare footage filmed by pioneering documentarians Albert and David Maysles, beautifully restored in 4K by Park Road Post in New Zealand. The live performances from The Beatles’ first American concert at the Washington, DC Coliseum and their Ed Sullivan appearances were demixed by WingNut Films and remixed by Giles Martin. Spotlighting this singular cultural moment and its continued resonance today, the music and footage are augmented by newly filmed interviews with Paul and Ringo, as well as fans whose lives were transformed by The Beatles.\n\nBeatles ’64 is directed by David Tedeschi and produced by Martin Scorsese, Margaret Bodde, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison, Sean Ono Lennon, Jonathan Clyde, and Mikaela Beardsley, with Jeff Jones and Rick Yorn serving as executive producers.\n\n@johnlennon @PaulMcCartney @GeorgeHarrisonOfficial @ringostarr"

The community controls the developmental direction of Old School RuneScape by voting on which updates it would like to receive.\n\nThe world's largest and most popular MMORPG, Old School RuneScape has been played by over 260 million players since the 2001 release of RuneScape. Old School RuneScape unites the intricate mechanics of modern MMOs with the nostalgic point-and-click gameplay of early role-playing games.\n\nOld School RuneScape is free to download and play, however, the game also offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items.

The community controls the developmental direction of Old School RuneScape by voting on which updates it would like to receive.\n\nThe world's largest and most popular MMORPG, Old School RuneScape has been played by over 260 million players since the 2001 release of RuneScape. Old School RuneScape unites the intricate mechanics of modern MMOs with the nostalgic point-and-click gameplay of early role-playing games.\n\nOld School RuneScape is free to download and play, however, the game also offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items.

            "description": "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is streaming February 13 on Peacock: https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-movies/bridget-jones-mad-about-the-boy\n\nTwo-time Academy Award® winner Renée Zellweger returns to the role that established a romantic-comedy heroine for the ages, a woman whose inimitable approach to life and love redefined an entire film genre.   \n  \nBridget Jones first blasted onto bookshelves in Helen Fielding’s literary phenomenon Bridget Jones’s Diary, which became a global bestseller and a blockbuster film. As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug-Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.  \n \nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark (Oscar® winner Colin Firth) was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan. She’s now a single mother to 9-year-old Billy and 4-year-old Mabel, and is stuck in a state of emotional limbo, raising her children with help from her loyal friends and even her former lover, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  \n  \nPressured by her Urban Family —Shazzer, Jude and Tom, her work colleague Miranda, her mother, and her gynecologist Dr. Rawlings (Oscar® winner Emma Thompson) — to forge a new path toward life and love, Bridget goes back to work and even tries out the dating apps, where she’s soon pursued by a dreamy and enthusiastic younger man (White Lotus’s Leo Woodall). Now juggling work, home and romance, Bridget grapples with the judgment of the perfect mums at school, worries about Billy as he struggles with the absence of his father, and engages in a series of awkward interactions with her son’s rational-to-a-fault science teacher (Oscar® nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor). The returning cast includes Oscar® winner Jim Broadbent and BAFTA winner Gemma Jones as Bridget’s parents and, as a new character, Isla Fisher (Now You See Me, The Great Gatsby) as Rebecca, Bridget’s neighbor.  \n \nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Michael Morris (To Leslie, Better Call Saul), from a screenplay by BAFTA nominee Helen Fielding, based on her novel, with contributions from Emmy winner Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady, Eric) and Oscar® nominee Dan Mazer (I Give it A Year, Bridget Jones’s Baby).  \n \nThe film is produced for Working Title by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, whose films, including The Danish Girl, Darkest Hour, Fargo, Les Misérables and The Theory of Everything, among others, have earned 14 Academy Awards® and six Best Picture nominations. The film is also produced by Jo Wallett (Wicked Little Letters, Catherine Called Birdy). The film is executive produced by Helen Fielding, Renée Zellweger, Amelia Granger and Sarah-Jane Wright. Working Title has produced all the Bridget Jones films.  \n \nUniversal Pictures and StudioCanal and Miramax present a Working Title production, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. The film will be released in theaters internationally by Universal Pictures and will stream exclusively on Peacock in the U.S.\n\n#BridgetJonesMovie #peacock  #officialtrailer",

                "description": "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is streaming February 13 on Peacock: https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-movies/bridget-jones-mad-about-the-boy\n\nTwo-time Academy Award® winner Renée Zellweger returns to the role that established a romantic-comedy heroine for the ages, a woman whose inimitable approach to life and love redefined an entire film genre.   \n  \nBridget Jones first blasted onto bookshelves in Helen Fielding’s literary phenomenon Bridget Jones’s Diary, which became a global bestseller and a blockbuster film. As a single career woman living in London, Bridget Jones not only introduced the world to her romantic adventures, but added “Singletons,” “Smug-Marrieds” and “f---wittage” into the global lexicon. Bridget’s ability to triumph despite adversity led her to finally marry top lawyer Mark Darcy and to become the mother of their baby boy. Happiness at last.  \n \nBut in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, Bridget is alone once again, widowed four years ago, when Mark (Oscar® winner Colin Firth) was killed on a humanitarian mission in the Sudan.

                "description": "Haiti’s international airport shut down temporarily on Monday after gangs opened fire at a Spirit Airlines flight landing in Port-Au-Prince, the U.S. State Department and the airline said. The latest violence came as a new prime minister was sworn in.\r\n\r\nThe flight, headed from Fort Lauderdale to Port-Au-Prince, was hit multiple times by gunfire as it was set to land in Haiti’s capital, striking a flight attendant, who suffered minor injuries. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane.\r\n\r\nThe flight was diverted and landed in the Dominican Republic, according to Spirit Airlines. It appeared to be part of what the U.S. Embassy called “gang-led efforts to block travel to and from Port-au-Prince which may include armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports.”\r\n\r\nMORE: https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/nation-world/haiti-gang-gunfire-hits-plane/507-9e9791e2-76b5-40dd-b178-985bc9834e78"

A couple of explorers, modern-day documentarians, and cultivators of curiosity.\n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nThings We're Most Curious About...\n\nGETTING OFF-GRID \nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  So self-reliance and sustainable living are a must.  We've learned heaps about renewable energy, managing waste, creating safe drinking water and foraging for food.  We carefully manage our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nTALKING TO STRANGERS\nPeople are busy (even on remote islands) and travelers are a dime a dozen.  It takes time to talk to strangers, and even more time to have a real connection.  Going the extra mile to get to know someone is a commitment. \n\nWhich is why these are our most treasured experiences.  Setting off into the world with curiosity as our guide and nature as our compass.  We talk to strangers and accept hospitality without fear or reservations.  Both giving and receiving.\n\nALTERNATIVE LIVING\nThese are people who are doing things differently. Forgoing the mainstream, seeking freedom and living on the margins. Creative, unique and inspiring people who challenge our ideas of home and community.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 We're Real-Time\n00:42 Sailboats Always Have Issues\n01:24 Refrigerator Issues\n02:32 Nautical Architecture Antwerp\n02:51 Melting Solar Panels\n03:52 Not Used to the Cold\n04:20 Toxic Battery Overcharging Issue\n06:33 Our Hybrid Engines are NOT Bleeding Edge\n08:10 Stray Current on a Sailboat\n13:38 Trying to Find and Remove Stray Current\n15:37 Why We Left Our Boat\n16:58 What Next While Waiting on Warranty Repairs?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BoatLife #Catamaran #Sailboat #Travel #LifeStyle \n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2024",
