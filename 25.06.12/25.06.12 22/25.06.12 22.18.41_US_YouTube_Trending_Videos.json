            "description": "On July 11, the entire world will look up. Get tickets now for #Superman - Only In Theaters and @IMAX \n\n“Superman,” DC Studios’ first feature film to hit the big screen, is set to soar into theaters worldwide this summer from Warner Bros. Pictures.  In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind. \n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with composer David Fleming (“The Last of Us”) and editors William Hoy (“The Batman”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).  \n\nDC Studios Presents a Troll Court Entertainment/The Safran Company Production, A James Gunn Film, “Superman,” which will be in theaters and IMAX® nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.",

Get tickets now for #Superman - Only In Theaters and @IMAX \n\n“Superman,” DC Studios’ first feature film to hit the big screen, is set to soar into theaters worldwide this summer from Warner Bros. Pictures.  In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind. \n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with composer David Fleming (“The Last of Us”) and editors William Hoy (“The Batman”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).  \n\nDC Studios Presents a Troll Court Entertainment/The Safran Company Production, A James Gunn Film, “Superman,” which will be in theaters and IMAX® nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialAudio",

Mein LEGO Zug fährt durch riesige Berge, durch im Dunkeln leuchtende und LED-beleuchtete Tunnel und eine verrückte selbstgebaute Poolnudel-Spiralachterbahn hinunter. Aber wird der Zug es schaffen oder endet das Ganze in einer Katastrophe?\n\n♡ Hol dir das Merchandise: https://aquariuminfo.com/ (weltweiter Versand 🌎)\n\nABONNIERE und sichere dir das Ökosystem-Set\n► https://www.youtube.com/c/AquariumInfo?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTriff die Crew!\n🐈 Nori\n🐲 Gizmo\n🦀 Nudeln & Gurke\n🦞 Mochi\n🐢 Harry\n🦐 Ralph\n🐸 Frito & Burrito\n🦎 Lucy & Zitrone\n🐠 Erdnuss & Gelee\n🦎 Limette & Pfeffer & Quietsche\n🪦 R.I.P. Kirby\n\nSeht zu, wie wir eine wahnsinnige, 60 Meter lange LEGO-Eisenbahn durchs Studio bauen, vorbei an einigen eurer Lieblingstiere, darunter Ralph, mein Pfauen-Mantis-Garnele, Mochi, mein Supermarkt-Hummer, und das geliebte Duo Lucy und Lemon, meine Axolotl. Wir bauen sogar eine Rube-Goldberg-Maschine für mein Kätzchen Nori, damit er Leckerlis bekommt, wenn der Zug vorbeifährt! In dieser abenteuerlichen Folge reisen wir außerdem zu einer verlassenen Eisenbahnstrecke, um etwas über Züge in der realen Welt zu lernen!\n\nDiese LEGO-Zugfahrt umfasst fünf spektakuläre Stopps, darunter ein Doppelgewächshaus mit lebenden Pflanzen und LEGO Pflanzen, einen verschneiten Berg mit Miniatur-Weihnachtsbäumen und LEGO Weihnachtsmann, ein Katzencafé, einen im Dunkeln leuchtenden Tunnel mit leuchtenden Kristallen und ein trockenes Wüstenökosystem mit LEGO Tieren und echten Kakteen. Der LEGO Zug ist mit einer winzigen Kamera ausgestattet, damit Sie sehen können, was der Zug sieht. Halten Sie also unterwegs Ausschau nach all den versteckten LEGO Bauten! Können Sie sie alle entdecken?\n\nBleiben Sie bis zum Ende dran, um zu sehen, ob der Zug die gesamte Fahrt unbeschadet übersteht! Dieses Video ist perfekt für alle, die LEGO Züge, individuelle LEGO Bauten, Axolotl, exotische Haustiere, seltene Tiere, DIY-Projekte oder einfach nur die Grundlagen einer epischen DIY-LEGO-Eisenbahn lieben!\n\nWenn Sie Kommentare, Vorschläge oder Fragen zu diesem oder zukünftigen LEGO-Zug-Videos haben, hinterlassen Sie sie gerne in den Kommentaren!

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

La numéro 2 mondiale est allée au bout d'elle-même, samedi, sur la terre battue du Court Philippe-Chatrier. Malgré une manche de retard à face la numéro 1 mondiale Aryna Sabalenka, l'Américaine de 21 ans a gardé le cap et élevé son niveau de jeu pour recoller au score et même renverser la vapeur. Bien aidée, certes, par les 70 fautes directes de la Biélorusse, la Floridienne est allée chercher sa victoire, son deuxième titre du Grand Chelem après l'US Open 2023, et son premier à Roland-Garros, trois ans après sa finale perdue contre Iga Swiatek.

            "description": "Listen to 'Sapphire' now: https://es.lnk.to/sapphireID\n\n\"Sapphire was the first song I finished for Play that made me know where the album was heading. It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it. This is the album version of the song, and my favourite song on the album. Hope you guys love it.

                "description": "Listen to 'Sapphire' now: https://es.lnk.to/sapphireID\n\n\"Sapphire was the first song I finished for Play that made me know where the album was heading. It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it. This is the album version of the song, and my favourite song on the album. Hope you guys love it.

Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda’s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba’s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars® for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.",

The warm entrance felt fitting for an artist whose music embodies the soul of summer: bold percussion, breezy vocals and the feeling of endless possibilities.\n\nWhen her sophomore album Touch dropped in 2005, it introduced a national audience to the infectious rhythms of go-go. Rooted in Washington, D.C., go-go is known for its layered percussion, funky basslines and live instrumentation made to hype the crowd. These sounds pulse through Amerie's music and helped to make \"1 Thing\" a standout in a year overflowing with R&B hits.\n\nAmerie, who once lived in Washington, D.C. for several years, returns to the city with a reimagined set accompanied by go-go legends Backyard Band. Together, they open the show with songs from her debut album All I Have, including \"Talkin' to Me\" and the quintessential summer anthem \"Why Don't We Fall in Love.\" She eases into her latest single, \"Mine,\" and delivers a fan-favorite \"I Just Died,\" before introducing a new rendition of \"Rolling Down My Face\" that you'll want to hear all the time from now on. By the time \"Talkin' About\" kicks in, Amerie is in full dance mode. When \"1 Thing\" closes out the set, she steps from behind the Desk to join the dance party, turning the performance into a celebration.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Talkin' to Me\"\n\"Why Don't We Fall in Love\"\n\"Mine\"\n\"I Just Died\"\n\"Rolling Down My Face\"\n\"Talkin' About\"\n\"1 Thing\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAmerie: vocals\nWarren Jones: keys \nMichael Dunklin: keys\nEric Britt: keys\nBobby Terry: guitar\nEugene Chapman: alto saxophone\nNathaniel Fields: bass\nPaul Edwards: drums\nKeith Robinson: percussion\nTanesia Mack: background vocals\nTonaee' Burgess: background vocals\nZay'Marie: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Alanté Serene\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Elizabeth Gillis\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #amerie \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

            "description": "The Pacers defeated the Thunder, 111-110 tonight in Oklahoma City. Pascal Siakam led the way for the Pacers with 19 points on 7-15 from the field (1-2 from 3) to go along with 10 rebounds and 3 assists. For the Thunder, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a team-high 38 points on 14-30 from the field (3-6 from 3). The Pacers lead the series 1-0.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers mounted an incredible comeback in the 4th quarter, at one point down 15 points, they managed to rally back and in the end it was Tyrese Haliburton who once again put the team ahead late! This is the FIFTH time this postseason that the Pacers have rallied from a 15+ point deficit, which is the MOST by any team in the playoffs since 1998! They also have become just the third team in NBA Playoffs history to rally from a 15 point deficit in the 4th quarter, joining the 2011 Dallas Mavericks and the 1992 Chicago Bulls. Haliburton's shot to put the team ahead with 0.3 seconds remaining put Tyrese in the history books, as that marks the FIFTH time this playoff run where he has made a go-ahead, game-winning or game-tying shot within the last 30 seconds of the 4th quarter or in overtime, the most of ANY player in NBA Playoff history! The record was formerly held by Ray Allen in his 2009 run, with four made shots of that variety.\n\nNever miss a moment with the latest news, trending stories and highlights to bring you closer to your favorite players and teams.\nDownload now ➡ https://nba.smart.link/NBAApp-YTDes\n\nSubscribe to the NBA: https://on.nba.com/2JX5gSN",

This is the FIFTH time this postseason that the Pacers have rallied from a 15+ point deficit, which is the MOST by any team in the playoffs since 1998! They also have become just the third team in NBA Playoffs history to rally from a 15 point deficit in the 4th quarter, joining the 2011 Dallas Mavericks and the 1992 Chicago Bulls. Haliburton's shot to put the team ahead with 0.3 seconds remaining put Tyrese in the history books, as that marks the FIFTH time this playoff run where he has made a go-ahead, game-winning or game-tying shot within the last 30 seconds of the 4th quarter or in overtime, the most of ANY player in NBA Playoff history! The record was formerly held by Ray Allen in his 2009 run, with four made shots of that variety.\n\nNever miss a moment with the latest news, trending stories and highlights to bring you closer to your favorite players and teams.\nDownload now ➡ https://nba.smart.link/NBAApp-YTDes\n\nSubscribe to the NBA: https://on.nba.com/2JX5gSN"

            "description": "The political partnership between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has exploded  in spectacular fashion into a bitter war of words.\n\nIt began when Mr Trump said he was “surprised and disappointed” at Elon Musk’s criticism of his flagship spending bill.   He said they had had a “great relationship” but “I don’t know if we will any more”. \n\nElon Musk responded on his social media platform X with a series of increasingly heated remarks about his former boss.   He said the President’s claims that he has supported the budget bill were “false”.   He said Mr Trump was  “ungrateful” for his help in getting elected and would have lost the election without his financial support.   Mr Musk warned that the President’s tariffs policy would lead to a recession.\n\nThen Musk made an explosive allegation, claiming without evidence that Donald Trump is named in the files about the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  He said that “is the real reason they have not been made public”.\n\nDonald Trump suggested that the easiest way to save money would be to terminate the billions of dollars in government contracts and subsidies that go to Elon Musk’s companies.   Musk said that President Trump should be impeached.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith and Simon Jack.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
