Mein LEGO Zug fährt durch riesige Berge, durch im Dunkeln leuchtende und LED-beleuchtete Tunnel und eine verrückte selbstgebaute Poolnudel-Spiralachterbahn hinunter. Aber wird der Zug es schaffen oder endet das Ganze in einer Katastrophe?\n\n♡ Hol dir das Merchandise: https://aquariuminfo.com/ (weltweiter Versand 🌎)\n\nABONNIERE und sichere dir das Ökosystem-Set\n► https://www.youtube.com/c/AquariumInfo?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTriff die Crew!\n🐈 Nori\n🐲 Gizmo\n🦀 Nudeln & Gurke\n🦞 Mochi\n🐢 Harry\n🦐 Ralph\n🐸 Frito & Burrito\n🦎 Lucy & Zitrone\n🐠 Erdnuss & Gelee\n🦎 Limette & Pfeffer & Quietsche\n🪦 R.I.P. Kirby\n\nSeht zu, wie wir eine wahnsinnige, 60 Meter lange LEGO-Eisenbahn durchs Studio bauen, vorbei an einigen eurer Lieblingstiere, darunter Ralph, mein Pfauen-Mantis-Garnele, Mochi, mein Supermarkt-Hummer, und das geliebte Duo Lucy und Lemon, meine Axolotl. Wir bauen sogar eine Rube-Goldberg-Maschine für mein Kätzchen Nori, damit er Leckerlis bekommt, wenn der Zug vorbeifährt! In dieser abenteuerlichen Folge reisen wir außerdem zu einer verlassenen Eisenbahnstrecke, um etwas über Züge in der realen Welt zu lernen!\n\nDiese LEGO-Zugfahrt umfasst fünf spektakuläre Stopps, darunter ein Doppelgewächshaus mit lebenden Pflanzen und LEGO Pflanzen, einen verschneiten Berg mit Miniatur-Weihnachtsbäumen und LEGO Weihnachtsmann, ein Katzencafé, einen im Dunkeln leuchtenden Tunnel mit leuchtenden Kristallen und ein trockenes Wüstenökosystem mit LEGO Tieren und echten Kakteen.

            "description": "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk honors the anniversaries of landmark albums that have shaped the course of music and culture.\n\nBobby Carter | June 10, 2025\nWiz Khalifa’s Kush & Orange Juice came out 15 years ago. To honor the anniversary, the Pittsburgh emcee assembled a group of Tiny Desk veterans, Pennsylvania natives and his DJ to reimagine highlights from the classic mixtape, plus tracks from Kush & Orange Juice 2, its similar, yet more mature follow-up.\n\nSomething was happening during the entire show and lots of us in the room could feel it. We were waiting for him to engage with us, but he didn’t. I stepped in after a few songs to remind him that it was OK to do so — still, nothing. But then, after “Crime Bud and Women,” Wiz spoke to the audience for the first and only time, wiping away tears: “You made me cry. F*** y’all!” \n\nI can muster up a few guesses as to why the emotion overflowed. Wiz had a host of family and friends present in this very intimate setting, including his father. And he did tell me how much he loves performing. But honestly, this sonic masterpiece was good enough to hit the tear ducts. \n\nSET LIST\n“Red Eye” \n“Mezmorized” \n“The Kid Frankie” \n“Never Been”\n“Up”\n“Crime Bud and Women” \n\nMUSICIANS\nWiz Khalifa: vocals\nKenneth Wright: music director, bass\nDJ Bonics: turntables\nUncle Bubz: keys\nRussell Gelman-Sheehan: guitar\nKendall Lewis: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideo Editor: Kara Frame\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #wizkhalifa \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

                "description": "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk honors the anniversaries of landmark albums that have shaped the course of music and culture.\n\nBobby Carter | June 10, 2025\nWiz Khalifa’s Kush & Orange Juice came out 15 years ago. To honor the anniversary, the Pittsburgh emcee assembled a group of Tiny Desk veterans, Pennsylvania natives and his DJ to reimagine highlights from the classic mixtape, plus tracks from Kush & Orange Juice 2, its similar, yet more mature follow-up.\n\nSomething was happening during the entire show and lots of us in the room could feel it. We were waiting for him to engage with us, but he didn’t. I stepped in after a few songs to remind him that it was OK to do so — still, nothing. But then, after “Crime Bud and Women,” Wiz spoke to the audience for the first and only time, wiping away tears: “You made me cry. F*** y’all!” \n\nI can muster up a few guesses as to why the emotion overflowed. Wiz had a host of family and friends present in this very intimate setting, including his father. And he did tell me how much he loves performing. But honestly, this sonic masterpiece was good enough to hit the tear ducts. \n\nSET LIST\n“Red Eye” \n“Mezmorized” \n“The Kid Frankie” \n“Never Been”\n“Up”\n“Crime Bud and Women” \n\nMUSICIANS\nWiz Khalifa: vocals\nKenneth Wright: music director, bass\nDJ Bonics: turntables\nUncle Bubz: keys\nRussell Gelman-Sheehan: guitar\nKendall Lewis: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideo Editor: Kara Frame\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #wizkhalifa \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

            "description": "The epic conclusion comes to theaters this November. Watch the #WickedForGood trailer now  🧹🫧\n\nPre-save ‘Wicked: For Good – The Soundtrack’ at https://wickedthesoundtrack.com\n-----\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wickedmovie\nX: https://twitter.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wickedmovie\nOfficial Site: https://wickedmovie.com\n\nAnd now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend …\n\nLast year’s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. \n\nDirected once again by award-winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda’s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba’s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars® for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.",

                "description": "The epic conclusion comes to theaters this November. Watch the #WickedForGood trailer now  🧹🫧\n\nPre-save ‘Wicked: For Good – The Soundtrack’ at https://wickedthesoundtrack.com\n-----\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wickedmovie\nX: https://twitter.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wickedmovie\nOfficial Site: https://wickedmovie.com\n\nAnd now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend …\n\nLast year’s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. \n\nDirected once again by award-winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda’s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba’s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars® for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz."

            "description": "Listen to 'Sapphire' now: https://es.lnk.to/sapphireID\n\n\"Sapphire was the first song I finished for Play that made me know where the album was heading. It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it. This is the album version of the song, and my favourite song on the album. Hope you guys love it.

I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it. This is the album version of the song, and my favourite song on the album. Hope you guys love it.

            "description": "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk honors the anniversaries of landmark albums that have shaped the course of music and culture.\n\nAlanté Serene | June 6, 2025\nWhen Amerie arrived at the Tiny Desk, her enthusiastic energy and bright smile was an instant mood boost. The warm entrance felt fitting for an artist whose music embodies the soul of summer: bold percussion, breezy vocals and the feeling of endless possibilities.\n\nWhen her sophomore album Touch dropped in 2005, it introduced a national audience to the infectious rhythms of go-go. Rooted in Washington, D.C., go-go is known for its layered percussion, funky basslines and live instrumentation made to hype the crowd. These sounds pulse through Amerie's music and helped to make \"1 Thing\" a standout in a year overflowing with R&B hits.\n\nAmerie, who once lived in Washington, D.C. for several years, returns to the city with a reimagined set accompanied by go-go legends Backyard Band. Together, they open the show with songs from her debut album All I Have, including \"Talkin' to Me\" and the quintessential summer anthem \"Why Don't We Fall in Love.\" She eases into her latest single, \"Mine,\" and delivers a fan-favorite \"I Just Died,\" before introducing a new rendition of \"Rolling Down My Face\" that you'll want to hear all the time from now on. By the time \"Talkin' About\" kicks in, Amerie is in full dance mode. When \"1 Thing\" closes out the set, she steps from behind the Desk to join the dance party, turning the performance into a celebration.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Talkin' to Me\"\n\"Why Don't We Fall in Love\"\n\"Mine\"\n\"I Just Died\"\n\"Rolling Down My Face\"\n\"Talkin' About\"\n\"1 Thing\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAmerie: vocals\nWarren Jones: keys \nMichael Dunklin: keys\nEric Britt: keys\nBobby Terry: guitar\nEugene Chapman: alto saxophone\nNathaniel Fields: bass\nPaul Edwards: drums\nKeith Robinson: percussion\nTanesia Mack: background vocals\nTonaee' Burgess: background vocals\nZay'Marie: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Alanté Serene\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Elizabeth Gillis\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #amerie \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

                "description": "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk honors the anniversaries of landmark albums that have shaped the course of music and culture.\n\nAlanté Serene | June 6, 2025\nWhen Amerie arrived at the Tiny Desk, her enthusiastic energy and bright smile was an instant mood boost. The warm entrance felt fitting for an artist whose music embodies the soul of summer: bold percussion, breezy vocals and the feeling of endless possibilities.\n\nWhen her sophomore album Touch dropped in 2005, it introduced a national audience to the infectious rhythms of go-go. Rooted in Washington, D.C., go-go is known for its layered percussion, funky basslines and live instrumentation made to hype the crowd. These sounds pulse through Amerie's music and helped to make \"1 Thing\" a standout in a year overflowing with R&B hits.\n\nAmerie, who once lived in Washington, D.C. for several years, returns to the city with a reimagined set accompanied by go-go legends Backyard Band. Together, they open the show with songs from her debut album All I Have, including \"Talkin' to Me\" and the quintessential summer anthem \"Why Don't We Fall in Love.\" She eases into her latest single, \"Mine,\" and delivers a fan-favorite \"I Just Died,\" before introducing a new rendition of \"Rolling Down My Face\" that you'll want to hear all the time from now on. By the time \"Talkin' About\" kicks in, Amerie is in full dance mode. When \"1 Thing\" closes out the set, she steps from behind the Desk to join the dance party, turning the performance into a celebration.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Talkin' to Me\"\n\"Why Don't We Fall in Love\"\n\"Mine\"\n\"I Just Died\"\n\"Rolling Down My Face\"\n\"Talkin' About\"\n\"1 Thing\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAmerie: vocals\nWarren Jones: keys \nMichael Dunklin: keys\nEric Britt: keys\nBobby Terry: guitar\nEugene Chapman: alto saxophone\nNathaniel Fields: bass\nPaul Edwards: drums\nKeith Robinson: percussion\nTanesia Mack: background vocals\nTonaee' Burgess: background vocals\nZay'Marie: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Alanté Serene\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Elizabeth Gillis\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #amerie \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

            "description": "The political partnership between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has exploded  in spectacular fashion into a bitter war of words.\n\nIt began when Mr Trump said he was “surprised and disappointed” at Elon Musk’s criticism of his flagship spending bill.   He said they had had a “great relationship” but “I don’t know if we will any more”. \n\nElon Musk responded on his social media platform X with a series of increasingly heated remarks about his former boss.   He said the President’s claims that he has supported the budget bill were “false”.   He said Mr Trump was  “ungrateful” for his help in getting elected and would have lost the election without his financial support.   Mr Musk warned that the President’s tariffs policy would lead to a recession.\n\nThen Musk made an explosive allegation, claiming without evidence that Donald Trump is named in the files about the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  He said that “is the real reason they have not been made public”.\n\nDonald Trump suggested that the easiest way to save money would be to terminate the billions of dollars in government contracts and subsidies that go to Elon Musk’s companies.   Musk said that President Trump should be impeached.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith and Simon Jack.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

Up until now I had been using a rope and stick to spin the fan rotor of the blower. Though this was useable and produced continuous one way rotation, it was unable to reach higher revolutions per minute due to limitations of the drive mechanism. As a result, only low pressure air flow was attainable. This is enough to smelt iron ore to produce a bloom. But it is not solid, with the result being slag with high carbon steel or cast iron droplets instead of a large solid bloom of low carbon iron. A pulley and belt produces continuous rotation and can be geared up with different pulley sizes to produce greater rpm.\n\n I first made a large clay wheel to be cranked by hand and a small one to drive the fan. It worked but had issues due to weight wasn't durable. The small clay wheel worked ok though. The next test was of a cane wheel made by weaving a basket without a base so if formed a cylinder for the belt to wrap around. This worked better and was faster. It sometimes has issues with the frame it's set in though. The final test was with a \"floating\" version of the cane wheel meaning that it wasn't set in a frame but had 2 handles and was spun while holding with 2 hands. This worked with fewer issues but would not be scalable. \n\nAll of the wheels in the video where 25 cm in diameter and gave a ratio of about 1:10 (one hand turn = 10 fan turns). The previous rope stick blower gives about 960 rpm whereas the the pulley and belt might give 1200 if cranked twice per second, though this may be exceeding its limits of durability. A larger diameter wheel of say 50 cm will give 1:20 ratios. Future experiments will need to be done to see if they make a difference to smelting results.\n\n00:00-14:05 Making the parts\n14:05-17:34 Clay pulley wheel\n17:34-24:54 Cane pulley wheel \n24:54-27:48 \"Floating\" pulley wheel (not fixed to a frame)\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
