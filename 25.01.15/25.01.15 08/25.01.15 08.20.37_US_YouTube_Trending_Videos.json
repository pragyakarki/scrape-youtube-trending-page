            "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

                "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

llamé bien loco, imaginando cuando yo te toco, respóndeme al Wpp envíame fotos, que chimba que se nos de la trabé y la emborraché y en el culo yo le eche el aceite de coco\nMotívese mor envíeme fotos, le llegue al barrio, la recogí en moto, la trabé y la emborraché, me dio el choto y la conspire y en el culo yo le eche el aceite coco\n\nY de camino a mi mansión, lo mamó en mi aventador, se puso mi cadenón, esto es más que conexión, más que sexo sin condón cómo se ve de rica en four, yo le regalé la Ford la Nmax y el iPhone y andamos running, 50 mil polvos en la Uni, fumando y tomando Don Juli, yo doy todo por ese booty\n\nMe manda videos en efímero\nCuando me la chingo me dice awo\nSi está con el novio no dice no\nYo fui el primero que la detonó\n\nMi bicho está contento, pensando en ti vivo loco de ponerte la adentro, sin cero sentimientos pero bien rico chingando en el apartamento, por más que te ame jure que yo nunca decir lo que por ti siento y si en algo no miento es que me pongo bellaco si escucho tu asentó, tú eres la parcerita entró la casa los cuchos lo meto y no grita, es una bellaquita me manda fotos de la cuca que está mojaita, lo pone y no lo quita me llama que la bebecita quiere lechita, chingando una maldita lo de nosotros es pa siempre la historia está escrita, pal novio la pistola y pa chingarte bien rico la playa y las olas, si quieres lo mato bebé y me importa un carajo que eso traiga cola, de chamaquito yo mataba y capiaba mi amor como el tema de Pola\nY ahora tengo una ruta directa que llega desde Medallo hasta Carola\n\nUh baby quiero ese culo Daily, mojándote toda, siempre chingamos lately, después del party pa la suite a lo underwater Dei V, vete preparando que ya voy llegando, pusy afeitaita, ya eso está goteando, fumando la shorty, tocándose, la piky, la honey pa darte como es, con todos los poderes, fronteamos porque se puede el ticket es floy maywether, la inspiración de todos ustedes, yo abajo tu arriba me dice que sí, me hace una llave por el cuello ya se va a venir, Si Si yo la voy a partir De la Gezzy un hp que te hace venir\n\nMe manda videos en efímero\nCuando me la chingo me dice awo\nSi está con el novio no dice no\nYo fui el primero que la enamoró\n\nLe gusta el menor porque soy el que gasta, me coge el chimbo en el labio se los arrastra, otra una puta como tú no creo que nazca, pa que no la vean se pone mi chasca y si el novio es picado a loco se le casca, se lo meto hasta que me dice basta, ella es mi baby yo soy su rasta, le pongo la barata y me la rasca, ese culo y le di una calima, en Colombia con más suscriptores que el Only de Karina, yo le doy las tetas pa su paraíso como el Titi con la Catalina, malparida cochina la lleno de leche me dicen pina, siempre con mis soldados como Pinina y sus chimbas las lleno de popper, tussy, ketamina\n \nTe llamé bien loco, imaginando cuando yo te toco, respóndeme al Wpp envíame fotos, que chimba que se nos de la trabé y la emborraché y en el culo yo le eche el aceite de coco\nMotívese mor envíeme fotos, le llegue al barrio, la recogí en moto, la trabé y la emborraché, me dio el choto y la conspire y en el culo yo le eche el aceite coco\n\nMalparida piroba una paisa bien loca se transforma en loba, no te me hagas la boba\nMe etiqueta en la historia y pone mi arroba, szs un puta en Medallo quiere mi camisa, no soy Leonardo ella es mi Mona Lisa, tú me avisas si lo quieres despacio o también deprisa\n\nTu tu tu no estás sola, estás con Blessd y su pistola, yo te compré una Cartier pa que siempre veas la hora, los maquillajes mami todos son de sephora pa que combines la pulserita blanca de Pandora y yo no sé cuándo yo a ti te pegue, dentro con la pared siento cielo que yo la encule, mamasita que rico esa boquita, abajo está mojaita soy lo que me la cama necesitas, pa mamarmelo bien rico ella siempre se coge el pelo, cuando se pone en cuatro ella a mí me lleva al cielo y hagamos un threesome con su amiga aquí no hay celos, reina somos culitos mantengámoslo sornero y ya\n\nLa baby está rica y tiene un parecido a Luisa Castro, yo se lo meto y nunca dejo rastro, como Yaviah ella me pide contacto, de pornografía en sexo su acto, ya me sé todos sus puntos exactos, en la cama yo me siento Jay Wheeler porque chingando tenemos un pacto\nBebe tú sabes que no hay otro que te chinge como yo y no hay una hp que me chinge como tu ma déjate ver que vamos a ser dame la luz que yo cargo contigo como cristo con la cruz\n\nTe llame bien loco, Imaginando cuando yo te toco, respóndeme al Wpp envíame fotos, Que chimba que se nos de la trabe y la emborrache y en el culo yo le eche el aceite de coco\n\nDEPORTIVO▶️https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf2N-7AUHB4\n▶️Instagram https://Blessd.lnk.to/Instagram\n▶️Facebook

te llamé bien loco, imaginando cuando yo te toco, respóndeme al Wpp envíame fotos, que chimba que se nos de la trabé y la emborraché y en el culo yo le eche el aceite de coco\nMotívese mor envíeme fotos, le llegue al barrio, la recogí en moto, la trabé y la emborraché, me dio el choto y la conspire y en el culo yo le eche el aceite coco\n\nY de camino a mi mansión, lo mamó en mi aventador, se puso mi cadenón, esto es más que conexión, más que sexo sin condón cómo se ve de rica en four, yo le regalé la Ford la Nmax y el iPhone y andamos running, 50 mil polvos en la Uni, fumando y tomando Don Juli, yo doy todo por ese booty\n\nMe manda videos en efímero\nCuando me la chingo me dice awo\nSi está con el novio no dice no\nYo fui el primero que la detonó\n\nMi bicho está contento, pensando en ti vivo loco de ponerte la adentro, sin cero sentimientos pero bien rico chingando en el apartamento, por más que te ame jure que yo nunca decir lo que por ti siento y si en algo no miento es que me pongo bellaco si escucho tu asentó, tú eres la parcerita entró la casa los cuchos lo meto y no grita, es una bellaquita me manda fotos de la cuca que está mojaita, lo pone y no lo quita me llama que la bebecita quiere lechita, chingando una maldita lo de nosotros es pa siempre la historia está escrita, pal novio la pistola y pa chingarte bien rico la playa y las olas, si quieres lo mato bebé y me importa un carajo que eso traiga cola, de chamaquito yo mataba y capiaba mi amor como el tema de Pola\nY ahora tengo una ruta directa que llega desde Medallo hasta Carola\n\nUh baby quiero ese culo Daily, mojándote toda, siempre chingamos lately, después del party pa la suite a lo underwater Dei V, vete preparando que ya voy llegando, pusy afeitaita, ya eso está goteando, fumando la shorty, tocándose, la piky, la honey pa darte como es, con todos los poderes, fronteamos porque se puede el ticket es floy maywether, la inspiración de todos ustedes, yo abajo tu arriba me dice que sí, me hace una llave por el cuello ya se va a venir, Si Si yo la voy a partir De la Gezzy un hp que te hace venir\n\nMe manda videos en efímero\nCuando me la chingo me dice awo\nSi está con el novio no dice no\nYo fui el primero que la enamoró\n\nLe gusta el menor porque soy el que gasta, me coge el chimbo en el labio se los arrastra, otra una puta como tú no creo que nazca, pa que no la vean se pone mi chasca y si el novio es picado a loco se le casca, se lo meto hasta que me dice basta, ella es mi baby yo soy su rasta, le pongo la barata y me la rasca, ese culo y le di una calima, en Colombia con más suscriptores que el Only de Karina, yo le doy las tetas pa su paraíso como el Titi con la Catalina, malparida cochina la lleno de leche me dicen pina, siempre con mis soldados como Pinina y sus chimbas las lleno de popper, tussy, ketamina\n \nTe llamé bien loco, imaginando cuando yo te toco, respóndeme al Wpp envíame fotos, que chimba que se nos de la trabé y la emborraché y en el culo yo le eche el aceite de coco\nMotívese mor envíeme fotos, le llegue al barrio, la recogí en moto, la trabé y la emborraché, me dio el choto y la conspire y en el culo yo le eche el aceite coco\n\nMalparida piroba una paisa bien loca se transforma en loba, no te me hagas la boba\nMe etiqueta en la historia y pone mi arroba, szs un puta en Medallo quiere mi camisa, no soy Leonardo ella es mi Mona Lisa, tú me avisas si lo quieres despacio o también deprisa\n\nTu tu tu no estás sola, estás con Blessd y su pistola, yo te compré una Cartier pa que siempre veas la hora, los maquillajes mami todos son de sephora pa que combines la pulserita blanca de Pandora y yo no sé cuándo yo a ti te pegue, dentro con la pared siento cielo que yo la encule, mamasita que rico esa boquita, abajo está mojaita soy lo que me la cama necesitas, pa mamarmelo bien rico ella siempre se coge el pelo, cuando se pone en cuatro ella a mí me lleva al cielo y hagamos un threesome con su amiga aquí no hay celos, reina somos culitos mantengámoslo sornero y ya\n\nLa baby está rica y tiene un parecido a Luisa Castro, yo se lo meto y nunca dejo rastro, como Yaviah ella me pide contacto, de pornografía en sexo su acto, ya me sé todos sus puntos exactos, en la cama yo me siento Jay Wheeler porque chingando tenemos un pacto\nBebe tú sabes que no hay otro que te chinge como yo y no hay una hp que me chinge como tu ma déjate ver que vamos a ser dame la luz que yo cargo contigo como cristo con la cruz\n\nTe llame bien loco, Imaginando cuando yo te toco, respóndeme al Wpp envíame fotos, Que chimba que se nos de la trabe y la emborrache y en el culo yo le eche el aceite de coco\n\nDEPORTIVO▶️https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf2N-7AUHB4\n▶️Instagram https://Blessd.lnk.to/Instagram\n▶️Facebook

More than 10,000 homes and other buildings have been destroyed with entire neighbourhoods reduced to ashes. \n\n180,000 people have been told to leave their homes with hundreds of thousands more on high alert.\n\nArson investigators are looking into the cause of one of the major fires, in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angleles.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 Happy new year! \n01:25 Our 2024 Stats\n13:18 Our 2024 Superlatives\n30:50 Behind the scenes\n36:50 Our 2025 plans\n41:15 Big announcement #1\n42:22 Big announcement #2\n45:50 Bloops",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 Happy new year! \n01:25 Our 2024 Stats\n13:18 Our 2024 Superlatives\n30:50 Behind the scenes\n36:50 Our 2025 plans\n41:15 Big announcement #1\n42:22 Big announcement #2\n45:50 Bloops"

So, I stopped by her house and her lawn was getting CRAZY! She’s been trying to get someone out to take care of it but nobody is answering their phones. The city has given her a warning for her grass and was going to charge her $240 to cut it, which she couldn’t afford. So, I completely transformed her lawn for free and she was in tears she was so happy.\n\n▶ Help support my work by picking up some merch - https://sbmowing.com/shop\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ Watch SB Pressure Washing - https://youtube.com/c/SBPressureWashing\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ See my Maruyama edger, trimmer, and blower - https://sbmowing.com/shop\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ See my Bad Boy Mower - https://badboycountry.com/sb-mowing\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ Checkout the handle on my shovel the \"Reach Right\" - https://reachrightusa.com/sbmowing/\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ See my Muck Boots - https://www.muckbootcompany.com/spencer-b/\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ Join my newsletter here - https://sbmowing.com/join-newsletter\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ Help me out by leaving a 5 star review - https://g.page/r/CRhGJrRAiDnrEAE/review",

So, I stopped by her house and her lawn was getting CRAZY! She’s been trying to get someone out to take care of it but nobody is answering their phones. The city has given her a warning for her grass and was going to charge her $240 to cut it, which she couldn’t afford. So, I completely transformed her lawn for free and she was in tears she was so happy.\n\n▶ Help support my work by picking up some merch - https://sbmowing.com/shop\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ Watch SB Pressure Washing - https://youtube.com/c/SBPressureWashing\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ See my Maruyama edger, trimmer, and blower - https://sbmowing.com/shop\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ See my Bad Boy Mower - https://badboycountry.com/sb-mowing\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ Checkout the handle on my shovel the \"Reach Right\" - https://reachrightusa.com/sbmowing/\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ See my Muck Boots - https://www.muckbootcompany.com/spencer-b/\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ Join my newsletter here - https://sbmowing.com/join-newsletter\n------------------------------------------------\n▶ Help me out by leaving a 5 star review - https://g.page/r/CRhGJrRAiDnrEAE/review"

                "description": "David Moyes has vowed to deliver an Everton team that reflects the values of the Club – to move the Blues in the right direction this season and pave the way for a bright new future.\n\nThe Scot was confirmed as Everton’s new Men’s Senior Team manager on Saturday, returning to the Club he “has great affection for”, where he spent 11 years from 2002 to 2013.\n\nDuring that time as Toffees boss – which included more than 500 matches – Moyes had Everton regularly qualifying for European competition, as well as reaching the FA Cup final in 2009.\n\nIn his first interview since his Blues return, he accepted the priority for the remainder of this campaign is to win enough points to move up the Premier League table.\n\nBut the former defender is eager to do that by instilling an ethos he believes is fundamental to Everton, which can lead to a new era in the Club’s world-class waterfront stadium from next season.\n\nSubscribe to Everton Football Club's official YouTube Channel: http://bit.ly/2wtCEbB\n\nFollow us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/everton\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/everton\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/everton\n\nWelcome to the Official Everton Football Club YouTube channel. We'll offer fans real insight into life at Goodison Park, Finch Farm and on the road with the Blues."

WRONG! ☠️ Upon disassembly, we discovered a terrible sight: major DAMAGE on the piston and inside the barrel! 😱 This wasn't a simple seal job anymore – it is a full-blown rebuild! In Part 1, we dive deep into the damage, stripping the cylinder bare and removing all the seals. We then prepare for a new barrel by machining off the old mounts. We also tackle the task of repairing the damaged piston on the cylinder rod. We carefully machine it down, weld on silicon bronze, and then machine it back to spec.

                "description": "Einer meiner Kunden bat mich, mir seinen 2020er Toyota Tundra anzusehen, der ein Startproblem hat und nach einigen Minuten Motorlaufzeit ausgeht. Der Truck springt an und läuft den ganzen Tag lang einwandfrei, bis Sie ihn abstellen. Danach müssen Sie ihn entweder mit Starthilfespray besprühen oder warten, bis er abgekühlt ist, um ihn wieder zu starten. Nach einigen Tests war das Problem offensichtlich, also brachte er ihn zum örtlichen Toyota-Händler, um ihn im Rahmen der Garantie reparieren zu lassen. Dort teilten sie ihm jedoch mit, dass meine Diagnose falsch sei und er das Teil bezahlen müsse, da es nicht unter die Garantie falle. Genau das wollte er vermeiden. Mal sehen, wie das für meinen Kunden ausgeht.\n- Viel Spaß!\n\nWenn Ihnen ein SMA-Video geholfen hat, denken Sie bitte darüber nach, uns mit „Patreon“ zu unterstützen.

O caminhão liga e funciona bem o dia todo, até você desligá-lo. Depois disso, você precisa borrifar fluido de partida ou esperar até que ele esfrie para reiniciar.

The truck will start and run fine all day long, until you shut it off. After that you either need to spray it with starting fluid or wait until it cools off to restart. After a few tests the problem was obvious so he took it to the local Toyota dealer to have it fixed under warranty. However they informed  him my diagnosis is wrong and he needs to pay for the part because it is not under warranty. This is the exact issue he was trying to avoid.

                "description": "The 2025 Golden Globes didn’t just kick off the year—it set Hollywood ablaze! From jaw-dropping wins to unexpected twists, this star-studded night gave us plenty to talk about.\n\nNikki Glaser made history as the first solo female host, and her sharp humor had the audience in stitches (with a few gasps along the way!). Timothée Chalamet’s mustache became an unintentional star, Zendaya’s dazzling diamond ring sparked major engagement rumors, and Selena Gomez flaunted her new fiancé and stunning bling. \n\nSpeaking of surprises, the evening was a family affair! From Angelina Jolie’s daughter Zahara to Ariana Grande showing up with her mom, the red carpet buzzed with heartfelt moments. But let’s not forget those jaw-dropping transformations, like Emma Stone’s bold new look and Ariana’s honey-brown hair makeover.\n\nAnd the awards? Oh, they didn’t disappoint! Zoe Saldana’s emotional first win, Adrien Brody’s heartfelt speech, and Demi Moore’s triumphant moment stole the show. Plus, Shōgun dominated TV categories, and Emilia Pérez cleaned up with multiple wins.\nMeanwhile, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson’s infamous feud made an unexpected cameo, leaving fans guessing. While Sebastian Stan surprised everyone with a rare glimpse into his personal life. And let’s not forget the comedy highlights—like Kieran Culkin tequila-toasting his way to an unprepared speech.\n\nCurious about all the glitz, glamour, and golden moments? Watch it all unfold on OSSA, where we’re bringing you every laugh, gasp, and unforgettable moment from the Golden Globes 2025! \n\n🎁 Join the OSSA'm Squad to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQfKpN66UN8d5Z15gFV9PGQ/join\n\n⭐ OSSA is the best source for entertainment news about the celebrities we love.\n⭐ Our YouTube channel dishes up celebrity news and gossip on the stars you admire the most. \n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel to watch more amazing videos about celebs!"
