But they’re not just here to perform — they’re here to battle. Season 4 brings a new experience that’ll stick around after Season 4 ends: the PvP Battle Stage! 16 players enter, one will emerge victorious.\n\nRide the Lightning guitars will be on the Battle Royale Island! These instruments are as mobile as they are musical… Use one to create a lightning arc in the sky that your squadmates can ride. On your descent, come crashing down to bring the beginning of an enemy’s end.\nOh yeah, you can also earn an Emote and Loading Screen from Battle Royale’s Metallica Quests! These sequentially available Quests, plus the other marks of Metallica, will be in BR ‘til July 2, 2024, at 9 AM ET.\n\nYou’ve got the fuel, the fire, but it’s still not hot enough. Turn up the temperature on Rocket Racing’s new Thrash Mountain track! This volcanic track is a tribute to all things rock — and not just the geology kind. You’ve got instrumental monuments, a stretch of road like a fretboard, and Metallica’s “Fuel” playing in the background.\n\nExperience a Metallica concert like no other in Metallica: Fuel. Fire. Fury. This journey through six fan-favorite songs features gameplay that matches the intensity. Check out https://fn.gg/Metallica for showtimes.",

                "description": "Metallica is lighting it up inside Fortnite: new Festival Season, M72 World Tour stage in Battle Royale, high-octane Rocket Racing track, and a playable concert. https://fn.gg/Metallica\n\nJames, Lars, Kirk, and Robert: these four are the Icons of Fortnite Festival Season 4! But they’re not just here to perform — they’re here to battle. Season 4 brings a new experience that’ll stick around after Season 4 ends: the PvP Battle Stage! 16 players enter, one will emerge victorious.\n\nRide the Lightning guitars will be on the Battle Royale Island! These instruments are as mobile as they are musical… Use one to create a lightning arc in the sky that your squadmates can ride. On your descent, come crashing down to bring the beginning of an enemy’s end.\nOh yeah, you can also earn an Emote and Loading Screen from Battle Royale’s Metallica Quests! These sequentially available Quests, plus the other marks of Metallica, will be in BR ‘til July 2, 2024, at 9 AM ET.\n\nYou’ve got the fuel, the fire, but it’s still not hot enough. Turn up the temperature on Rocket Racing’s new Thrash Mountain track! This volcanic track is a tribute to all things rock — and not just the geology kind. You’ve got instrumental monuments, a stretch of road like a fretboard, and Metallica’s “Fuel” playing in the background.\n\nExperience a Metallica concert like no other in Metallica: Fuel. Fire. Fury. This journey through six fan-favorite songs features gameplay that matches the intensity. Check out https://fn.gg/Metallica for showtimes."

            "description": "The Wild Robot - In Theaters September 27\n\nFrom DreamWorks Animation comes a new adaptation of a literary sensation, Peter Brown’s beloved, award-winning, #1 New York Times bestseller, The Wild Robot. \n\nThe epic adventure follows the journey of a robot—ROZZUM unit 7134, “Roz” for short — that is shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and must learn to adapt to the harsh surroundings, gradually building relationships with the animals on the island and becoming the adoptive parent of an orphaned gosling. \n\nThe Wild Robot stars Academy Award® winner Lupita Nyong’o (Us, The Black Panther franchise) as robot Roz; Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us, The Mandalorian) as fox Fink; Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara (Schitt’s Creek, Best in Show) as opossum Pinktail; Oscar® nominee Bill Nighy (Living, Love Actually) as goose Longneck; Kit Connor (Heartstopper, Rocketman) as gosling Brightbill and Oscar® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once, this summer’s The Fall Guy) as Vontra, a robot that will intersect with Roz’s life on the island. \n\nThe film also features the voice talents of Emmy winning pop-culture icon Mark Hamill (Star Wars franchise, The Boy and the Heron), Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows, The SpongeBob Movie franchise) and Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee Ving Rhames (Mission: Impossible films, Pulp Fiction). \n\nA powerful story about the discovery of self, a thrilling examination of the bridge between technology and nature and a moving exploration of what it means to be alive and connected to all living things, The Wild Robot is written and directed by three-time Oscar® nominee Chris Sanders—the writer-director of DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon, The Croods, and Disney’s Lilo & Stitch—and is produced by Jeff Hermann (DreamWorks Animation’s The Boss Baby 2: Family Business; co-producer, Kung Fu Panda franchise). \n\nPeter Brown’s The Wild Robot, an illustrated middle-grade novel first published in 2016, became a phenomenon, rocketing to #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. The book has since inspired a trilogy that now includes The Wild Robot Escapes and The Wild Robot Protects. Brown’s work on the Wild Robot series and his other bestselling books have earned him a Caldecott Honor, a Horn Book Award, two E.B. White Awards, two E.B. White Honors, a Children’s Choice Award for Illustrator of the Year, two Irma Black Honors, a Golden Kite Award and a New York Times Best Illustrated Book Award. \n\nSocial Handles:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dreamworksthewildrobot\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamworks \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thewildrobot\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dreamworks \nWebsite: https://www.TheWildRobotMovie.com\n#TheWildRobotMovie",
