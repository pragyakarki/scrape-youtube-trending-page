During the first half, both teams' backline put in an amazing effort as not many chances went past both sides. Heading into the second half, much stayed the same until Brandon Vazquez's towering header gave the USMNT a 1-0 lead late in the game. It didn't take look for Canada to respond. Steven Vitória's clinical penalty finish forced the game to extra time. In the final stages of extra time, Jacob Shaffelburg gave Canada the brief lead, but a costly own goal forced the game to penalty kicks. Within penalty kicks, it was Matt Turner's HUGE saves which sealed the victory for the United States.

Visit us at https://starface.world\n\nTo celebrate the release of “Barbie” we had Barbie and Ken — aka Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling — play with puppies while answering your questions. It was adorable. The puppies were, simply put, chaotic. And now we know that Margot is obsessed with “Jury Duty” like the rest of us. Don’t worry, they also spilled on Greta Gerwig’s sleepover parties with the “Barbie” cast, Margot finally working with Emma Mackey, and much more!

                "description": "Presented by Starface. Visit us at https://starface.world\n\nTo celebrate the release of “Barbie” we had Barbie and Ken — aka Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling — play with puppies while answering your questions. It was adorable. The puppies were, simply put, chaotic. And now we know that Margot is obsessed with “Jury Duty” like the rest of us. Don’t worry, they also spilled on Greta Gerwig’s sleepover parties with the “Barbie” cast, Margot finally working with Emma Mackey, and much more! Watch it all now! #Barbie #MargotRobbie #RyanGosling\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/188935\n\nSubscribe to BuzzFeed Celeb: https://bzfd.it/2kU81Ls\n\nBuzzFeed Celeb\nCelebs + puppies, kittens, thirst tweets, and more = so much yes.\n\nGET MORE BUZZFEED:\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedvideo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/asis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedmultiplayer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedunsolvednetwork\nhttp://youtube.com/buzzfeedceleb\nhttps://www.youtube.com/perolike\nhttps://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedviolet\nhttps://www.youtube.com/goodful\nhttps://www.youtube.com/nifty\nhttps://www.youtube.com/buzzfeedtasty\nhttps://www.youtube.com/bringme\nhttps://www.youtube.com/abouttoeat\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO BUZZFEED NEWSLETTERS:\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/newsletters\n\nMUSIC\nSFX Provided By AudioBlocks\n(https://www.audioblocks.com)\n\nLicensed via Audio Network\n\nSTILLS\n/BuzzMoji\nVariety's 2nd Annual Power Of Women Luncheon - Arrivals\nSteve Granitz/Getty Images\nA tasty cinnamon bun with icing on a white background\nSpauln/Getty Images\n\"Emily\" Premiere At Cine Cite UGC Les Halles\nAntoine Flament/Getty Images\n\nVIDEO\nCute Heart Transition Pink Black Background\nmurabito/Getty Images"

We each get 5 minutes to build a random Skibidi Toilet like Gman Skibidi Toilet or one of the Cameraman, TV Man, or Speaker Man. They had no idea that I was going to be copying their builds! I secretly installed the Xray Mod in Minecraft so I could see exactly what they were building in the build battle! Will they find out?\n\nMusic: https://www.epidemicsound.com/"

Despite it being the dry season, it still rains unpredictably in this climate. This can undo lots of labor in dissolving bricks. I built a shelter from wood and palm thatch to house the entire brick making process from the rain. This was no easy task with primitive technology. Leveling the ground took a week with digging sticks and clay pots to move the soil down the slope to form a flat floor. Another week was spent cutting the timber with a stone axe and then lashing the frame with lawyer cane to form the 3 x 3 pyramidal hut with a total height of 3.5 m. A final week was spent cutting, splitting and thatching a total of 1850 palm fronds to cover the roof. \nI then made 50 bricks (enough for one firing) along one side of the huts floor and made a kiln from other bricks right in the center of the hut's floor under the highest point of the hut. A space for firewood was put in the corner. \nThough I didn't fire the kiln in this video due to time constraints, it should work well without burning the roof. I've previously had a kiln under cover and it worked well. This pyramidal roof design should funnel the smoke up preserving the thatch from mold and insects. The reason I went back to using thatch instead of tiles is  that I need bricks and tiles to make such a hut so this hut needs to be built before obtaining those materials.\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Killers of the Flower Moon, in theaters October.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons, John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, Tantoo Cardinal, Cara Jade Myers, JaNae Collins, and Jillian Dion, Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Academy Award winner Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book.\n\nHailing from Apple Studios, Killers of the Flower Moon was produced alongside Imperative Entertainment, Sikelia Productions and Appian Way. Producers are Scorsese, Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas and Daniel Lupi, with DiCaprio, Rick Yorn, Adam Somner, Marianne Bower, Lisa Frechette, John Atwood, Shea Kammer and Niels Juul serving as executive producers.\n\nSong: \"Stadium Pow Wow (feat.

                "description": "An overview of seawater desalination: removing salt to make drinkable water from the ocean.\n💡 Go to https://brilliant.org/PracticalEngineering for a 30-day free trial & the first 200 people will get 20% off their annual subscription.\n\nCorrection: The Carlsbad plant produces 50 MGD, which is roughly 190,000 cubic meters per day (not 23,000 as stated).\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that there are more than 18,000 desalination plants operating across the globe. But, those plants provide less than a percent of global water needs even though they consume a quarter of all the energy used by the water industry. The oceans are a nearly unlimited resource of water with this seemingly trivial caveat, which is that the water is just a little bit salty. It’s totally understandable to wonder why that little bit of salt is such an enormous obstacle.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-why-is-desalination-so-difficult?ref=practical-engineering\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

            "description": "The 2024 Aston Martin DB12 ($281,800 in Canada, $245,000 in the US) is finally here and is what Aston calls the world’s first Super Tourer. The V12 found in the DB11 has been left behind, and in its stead is an even more powerful twin-turbo V8 that makes 671 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Along with many new updates, such as stiffer torsional rigidity, all-new suspension, and an upgraded infotainment system, does the new DB12 deserve the title of Super Tourer? And how does it stack up against the competition? Thomas and James are excited to find out. We hope you enjoy the episode.
