            "description": "Be careful what you wish for ⭐️ Watch the NEW trailer for Disney's #Wish, coming only to theaters this Thanksgiving. \n\nRevealed today are additional members of the film’s voice cast, who join previously announced cast members Ariana DeBose, who voices 17-year-old heroine Asha; Chris Pine, who lends his voice to the formidable King Magnifico; and Alan Tudyk, who provides the memorable voice of Asha’s pet goat, Valentino. \n\nCast members include:\nAngelique Cabral as Queen Amaya, the wife and sounding board of King Magnifico; Victor Garber as Asha’s grandfather, Sabino, who—at 100 years old—is patiently waiting for his wish to be granted; and Natasha Rothwell as Asha’s loving and supportive mom, Sakina.\n \nPlus, Asha’s tight-knit group of confidants, protectors and forever friends: Jennifer Kumiyama as Asha’s dearest friend, Dahlia, who’s an accomplished baker and unofficial leader of their group; Evan Peters as the strong guy with a big heart and bigger yawn, Simon; Harvey Guillén as Gabo, who may be cynical, but he has a heart of gold; Ramy Youssef as Safi, who’s plagued by allergies; Niko Vargas as Asha’s joyful, always smiling buddy, Hal; Della Saba as the seemingly shy teenager, Bazeema, who’s full of surprises; and Jon Rudnitsky as Asha’s rosy-cheeked, wiggly-eared pal, Dario.\n \nABOUT THE MOVIE\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios’ “Wish” is an all-new musical-comedy welcoming audiences to the magical kingdom of Rosas, where Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe—the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico—to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Featuring the voices of Academy Award®-winning actor Ariana DeBose as Asha, Chris Pine as Magnifico, and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino, the film is helmed by Oscar®-winning director Chris Buck (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), and produced by Peter Del Vecho (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Juan Pablo Reyes Lancaster Jones (“Encanto”). Jennifer Lee (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) executive produces—Lee and Allison Moore (“Night Sky,” “Manhunt”) are writers on the project. With original songs by Grammy®-nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer/songwriter/musician Benjamin Rice, plus score by composer Dave Metzger, “Wish” opens only in theaters on Nov. 22, 2023. \n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneywishmovie/ / https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\n\nHashtag: #Wish",

                "description": "Be careful what you wish for ⭐️ Watch the NEW trailer for Disney's #Wish, coming only to theaters this Thanksgiving. \n\nRevealed today are additional members of the film’s voice cast, who join previously announced cast members Ariana DeBose, who voices 17-year-old heroine Asha; Chris Pine, who lends his voice to the formidable King Magnifico; and Alan Tudyk, who provides the memorable voice of Asha’s pet goat, Valentino. \n\nCast members include:\nAngelique Cabral as Queen Amaya, the wife and sounding board of King Magnifico; Victor Garber as Asha’s grandfather, Sabino, who—at 100 years old—is patiently waiting for his wish to be granted; and Natasha Rothwell as Asha’s loving and supportive mom, Sakina.\n \nPlus, Asha’s tight-knit group of confidants, protectors and forever friends: Jennifer Kumiyama as Asha’s dearest friend, Dahlia, who’s an accomplished baker and unofficial leader of their group; Evan Peters as the strong guy with a big heart and bigger yawn, Simon; Harvey Guillén as Gabo, who may be cynical, but he has a heart of gold; Ramy Youssef as Safi, who’s plagued by allergies; Niko Vargas as Asha’s joyful, always smiling buddy, Hal; Della Saba as the seemingly shy teenager, Bazeema, who’s full of surprises; and Jon Rudnitsky as Asha’s rosy-cheeked, wiggly-eared pal, Dario.\n \nABOUT THE MOVIE\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios’ “Wish” is an all-new musical-comedy welcoming audiences to the magical kingdom of Rosas, where Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star. Together, Asha and Star confront a most formidable foe—the ruler of Rosas, King Magnifico—to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Featuring the voices of Academy Award®-winning actor Ariana DeBose as Asha, Chris Pine as Magnifico, and Alan Tudyk as Asha’s favorite goat, Valentino, the film is helmed by Oscar®-winning director Chris Buck (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Raya and the Last Dragon”), and produced by Peter Del Vecho (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) and Juan Pablo Reyes Lancaster Jones (“Encanto”). Jennifer Lee (“Frozen,” “Frozen 2”) executive produces—Lee and Allison Moore (“Night Sky,” “Manhunt”) are writers on the project. With original songs by Grammy®-nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy-winning producer/songwriter/musician Benjamin Rice, plus score by composer Dave Metzger, “Wish” opens only in theaters on Nov. 22, 2023. \n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneywishmovie/ / https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyWishMovie / https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\n\nHashtag: #Wish"

            "title": "How to fight climate change with parking lots",
            "description": "Why haven’t we covered them in solar panels?\n\nThis episode is presented by Delta. Delta doesn’t have a say in our editorial, but they make videos like this possible. For more information, visit http://www.delta.com/sustainability.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn 2021, President Biden set an ambitious climate goal for the US to reach net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050. And as part of the transition to renewable energy, the country has drastically ramped up production of solar over the past few years. But that’s led to a new problem: finding enough land on which to put solar panels. \n\nThe easiest and cheapest places to install solar panels are often large, undeveloped plots of land. It's why, in many places across the country, we've seen rural areas — including fragile desert ecosystems and valuable farmland — turned into solar farms. Many local residents and conservationists have protested these rural solar projects for a variety of reasons: Some want to keep natural views, others want to retain space for agriculture or aim to preserve biodiversity.

For more information, visit http://www.delta.com/sustainability.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nIn 2021, President Biden set an ambitious climate goal for the US to reach net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050. And as part of the transition to renewable energy, the country has drastically ramped up production of solar over the past few years. But that’s led to a new problem: finding enough land on which to put solar panels. \n\nThe easiest and cheapest places to install solar panels are often large, undeveloped plots of land. It's why, in many places across the country, we've seen rural areas — including fragile desert ecosystems and valuable farmland — turned into solar farms. Many local residents and conservationists have protested these rural solar projects for a variety of reasons: Some want to keep natural views, others want to retain space for agriculture or aim to preserve biodiversity. Solar will likely play an important role in the country’s move away from fossil fuels — but is there a smarter way to do it that doesn’t require taking up so much rural land?\n\nIn the video above, we explore one option that could help: parking lots. Solar photovoltaics researcher and professor Joshua Pearce goes into the data on how placing solar canopies over parking lots could be a worthwhile investment for many cities. And as more countries, like France, are moving toward retrofitting parking spaces with solar, we look at what it could mean in the US.   \n\nSOURCES:\n\nStudies: \nhttps://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1177&context=materials_fp \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148121000756?via%3Dihub \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03957-7 \nhttps://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/ \n\nFurther reading: \nhttps://e360.yale.edu/features/putting-solar-panels-atop-parking-lots-a-green-energy-solution \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/02/06/france-solar-parking-lots/ \nhttps://www.vox.com/2021/8/18/22556193/solar-energy-biodiversity-birds-pollinator-land \n\nVox is on a mission is to help everyone, regardless of income or status, understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape it.\n\nWatch our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyE\nFollow Vox on TikTok: http://tiktok.com/@voxdotcom\nCheck out our articles: https://www.vox.com/\nListen to our podcasts: https://www.vox.com/podcasts"

At least that’s what they said for this barbeque challenge… Cousins barbeque in Fort Worth Texas offers an all you can eat Texas barbeque for only $25. Upon my second visit to the restaurant, one of the owners(?) Managers(?) Challenged me to try to beat the record and if I could double the record, I would be awarded with $1000.￼. This all you can eat barbeque restaurant turned into the ultimate Texas barbeque challenge very quickly! With unlimited meets and sides, I think this is the best food deal in all of Texas. The barbeque is cooked traditional, Texas style, and they offer great brisket, chicken, huge ribs, pulled pork, sausage, and everything you could want or need! Can we beat the record and win the cash?

Anker Nano USB-C Fast Charging Lineup for iPhone 15 on Amazon: https://ankerfast.club/HNUBgh and on Anker.com: https://shop.anker.com/21iTX8 According to lab tests, the 5,000mAh Anker Nano Power Bank can charge an iPhone 15 to 79%. Power loss from internal components may prevent a full charge.\n\nTitanium is a really expensive material. Titanium is also EXTREMELY difficult to work with. But its really cool to see how Apple has assembled their new iPhone 15 Pro Max from the inside. We also take apart Apple's Tetra-Prism camera to see how the 5x Telephoto lens functions. \n\nGet my Teardown Skin for your phone HERE: https://www.dbrand.com/teardown\nGet my JerryRig Razor knife HERE: https://www.jerryrigknife.com/\n\nFollow me for updates! \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/zacksjerryrig \nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/1U4bQqv \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ZacksJerryRig \n\nLARGE tool kit: http://amzn.to/2DURcr7 \nTravel Tool Kit: https://amzn.to/30LKXOY \nMega Tool Kit: https://amzn.to/2OwequL \nPlastic Pry tools: http://amzn.to/1Tu57pI \nMetal phone opening tool: http://amzn.to/1WdOFv0 \nThe camera I used to film this video: http://amzn.to/2p7GtkX (GH6 https://amzn.to/3LyfW8d) \nThe Lens I used for this video: http://amzn.to/1QOXDw2 \nWide angle lens: http://amzn.to/2qiYM4u \nAnd this Metabones adapter: http://amzn.to/2iZ67Ty \nThis is the drone I use: https://amzn.to/3JEuTXs \n\nTO SEND ME STUFF: See my P.O.

I had no choice but to create a trap in return: a trap so large that no matter where you step, you're already doomed. Here's How I Removed the World Under my Enemy...\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VeVDgNgv8V\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Tubbo / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy! \n\nThanks to Slatcho for the help editing: https://linktr.ee/slatcho?utm_source=linktree_admin_share",

I had no choice but to create a trap in return: a trap so large that no matter where you step, you're already doomed. Here's How I Removed the World Under my Enemy...\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VeVDgNgv8V\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Tubbo / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy! \n\nThanks to Slatcho for the help editing: https://linktr.ee/slatcho?utm_source=linktree_admin_share"

But buckle up, because it's happening!\n\nWe all know how addictive TikTok can be – one minute you're scrolling, and the next, you're attempting the latest viral dance in your living room. 🕺💃 But what if I told you that while we're getting our groove on, some traditional jobs might be in jeopardy? 🙅‍♀️👷‍♂️\n\nThink about it: with millions of users glued to their screens, companies are jumping on the TikTok bandwagon, using it as a unique marketing tool. 📢📈 But what happens to jobs that once relied on more traditional advertising methods? Are billboards, magazine spreads, and even certain TV commercials becoming a thing of the past? 📺🚫 Well, my friends, the writing might just be on the virtual wall.\n\nBut it's not just the ad world feeling the heat! 🔥🌍 Even some individuals with regular 9-to-5 gigs are striking out on their own, thanks to the platform's insane reach. Who knew that sharing your quirky talents or life hacks could turn into a full-time career? 🤹‍♀️🛠️ From makeup artists to DIY gurus, TikTok is becoming a place where creativity equals cash.\n\nSo, is this a bad thing or just the natural evolution of the digital age? 🤔 Are we witnessing a revolution that's putting power back into the hands of the people, or are we waving goodbye to certain job titles forever? 💔👋 One thing's for sure, my friends – TikTok is rewriting the rulebook faster than we can say \"viral sensation\"!\n\nJoin me as we unravel this captivating and slightly controversial trend.

We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. That led us to needing a place to live while we realized our dream of building a shipping container home. After lots of searching we finally discovered Geodesic Dome's and it was the perfect fit for us while we took our time with the container home.\n\nMusicbed SyncID: \nMB01Q7KG9GU69QL"

Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, JC Chasez, Lance Bass, and Joey Fatone have sold more than 70 million records, toured the world, and endured as one of the defining pop groups of a generation. They're reunited not only for this record-breaking episode (most wings on the table!), but also with a brand-new single, \"Better Place,\" dropping September 29. But how are they with spicy food? Find out as Timberlake and Fatone take on the gauntlet for a second time, and the rest of the band joins them to discuss live-show malfunctions, crazy fan stories, and the definitive Mount Rushmore of *NSYNC songs.\n\nBUY HOT ONES HOT SAUCE NOW: https://fwfea.st/hotsauces\n\nTRY THE HOT ONES BONELESS CHICKEN BITE CHALLENGE: https://fwfea.st/chickenbites\n\nBUY HOT ONES TRUTH OR DAB: THE GAME: http://truthordabgame.com\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE HOT ONES MONTHLY HOT SAUCE SUBSCRIPTION: https://bit.ly/2veY50P\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE FIRST WE FEAST NEWSLETTER: http://firstwefeast.com/signup\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO FIRST WE FEAST ON YOUTUBE: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE BY DONATING TO COMMON THREADS, THE OFFICIAL  CHARITY PARTNER OF HOT ONES: https://www.commonthreads.org/firstwefeast/\n\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\n\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\nhttp://instagram.com/hotones/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast",

                "description": "*NSYNC is back, baby—and the iconic boy band is kicking off Season 22 of Hot Ones in epic fashion! Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, JC Chasez, Lance Bass, and Joey Fatone have sold more than 70 million records, toured the world, and endured as one of the defining pop groups of a generation. They're reunited not only for this record-breaking episode (most wings on the table!), but also with a brand-new single, \"Better Place,\" dropping September 29. But how are they with spicy food? Find out as Timberlake and Fatone take on the gauntlet for a second time, and the rest of the band joins them to discuss live-show malfunctions, crazy fan stories, and the definitive Mount Rushmore of *NSYNC songs.\n\nBUY HOT ONES HOT SAUCE NOW: https://fwfea.st/hotsauces\n\nTRY THE HOT ONES BONELESS CHICKEN BITE CHALLENGE: https://fwfea.st/chickenbites\n\nBUY HOT ONES TRUTH OR DAB: THE GAME: http://truthordabgame.com\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE HOT ONES MONTHLY HOT SAUCE SUBSCRIPTION: https://bit.ly/2veY50P\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE FIRST WE FEAST NEWSLETTER: http://firstwefeast.com/signup\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO FIRST WE FEAST ON YOUTUBE: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\n\nMAKE A DIFFERENCE BY DONATING TO COMMON THREADS, THE OFFICIAL  CHARITY PARTNER OF HOT ONES: https://www.commonthreads.org/firstwefeast/\n\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\n\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\nhttp://instagram.com/hotones/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast"

Use our link or code LINUS for 10 bonus entries! \n\nEver walk into a small computer shop and think “who is buying all these old products?” Well we did, and that weighed on us. Sleepless nights turned into exhausting days of wondering “just what is in that small computer shop?” It became such a problem that we found ourselves with no other option than to walk in, close the door behind us, and tell the owner “we’ll take everything you’ve got”. That’s what we did. We were forced to, if you really think about it. Just what are we going to get? Will there be RTX 4090s, or old Voodoos? 13th gen i9s or Socket 1 486s? Thunderbolt 4 cables or serial port connectors?\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1532434-we-will-buy-everything-in-this-mom-pop-computer-store/\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.\n\n► GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n► GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n► SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners\n► EQUIPMENT WE USE TO FILM LTT: https://lmg.gg/LTTEquipment\n► OUR WAN PODCAST GEAR: https://lmg.gg/wanset\n\nFOLLOW US \n---------------------------------------------------  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/linustech\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/LinusTech\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/linustech\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@linustech\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/linustech\n\nMUSIC CREDIT\n---------------------------------------------------\nIntro: Laszlo - Supernova\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfxmFU3lWY\niTunes Download Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/supernova/id936805712\nArtist Link: https://soundcloud.com/laszlomusic\n\nOutro: Approaching Nirvana - Sugar High\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngsGBSCDwcI\nListen on Spotify: http://spoti.fi/UxWkUw\nArtist Link: http://www.youtube.com/approachingnirvana\n\nIntro animation by MBarek Abdelwassaa https://www.instagram.com/mbarek_abdel/\nMonitor And Keyboard by vadimmihalkevich / CC BY 4.0  https://geni.us/PgGWp\nMechanical RGB Keyboard by BigBrotherECE / CC BY 4.0 https://geni.us/mj6pHk4\nMouse Gamer free Model By Oscar Creativo / CC BY 4.0 https://geni.us/Ps3XfE\n\nCHAPTERS\n---------------------------------------------------\n0:00 Intro\n0:49 Thanks Ridge!\n1:21 First Batch\n4:52 Clearance Shelf\n6:33 Third Batch\n7:34 Fourth Batch\n9:25 GPU Bunch\n12:00 Batch Number 6\n13:22 BUZZ LIGHTYEAR\n13:54 Batches 7 and 8\n16:51 Cable Wall\n20:38 Another Wall\n22:17 Laptops\n23:27 The Really Old Stuff\n25:44 Random Garbage?\n29:53 Ridge x Hennessey\n30:22 Last Case\n33:05 GRAND TOTAL\n33:50 Outro",

            "description": "Welcome to Hot Mess with Alix Earle! We are starting things off by addressing the question everyone has been asking, “does Alix have a boyfriend?” She opens up about how she met NFL man, their first date, navigating public controversy and their current relationship status. Hot Mess is all about providing an authentic glimpse into Alix's life, and that includes introducing you to her friends and family. In this episode, get ready to meet her college BFFs as they reminisce about their early, awkward days and recount some hilarious stories (hint: adventures like sleeping at a middle school and even becoming the school mascot for three weeks). You’ve gotten ready with her, but now it’s time to get real with her. Alix unveils the truth behind the viral TikTok where she went to Drake’s birthday - and it’s not what you think. Lastly, Alix invites you on a final mission that takes her back to her old beloved college home, Casa Amor, where she has an encounter with some frat boys in order to rescue all of her and her friends nudes that were left behind.

ABC will begin the evening with an episode of “AFV,” , followed by a lineup that will include exclusive moments featuring Kelly Ripa and sneak peaks at upcoming Disney projects. Featuring the broadcast world premieres of Walt Disney Animation’s new animated short film “Once Upon a Studio” and the beloved film “Encanto,” “The Wonderful World of Disney: Disney’s 100th Anniversary Celebration” airs SUNDAY, OCTOBER 15 (8:00 p.m. – 10:30 p.m. EDT/PDT).\n \nAbout “Once Upon a Studio”\nAn all-star ensemble of beloved characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios come together in “Once Upon a Studio” for a joyful, entertaining and emotional reunion as they assemble for a spectacular group photo to mark Disney's 100th anniversary. Featuring 543 Disney characters from more than 85 feature-length and short films, “Once Upon a Studio” welcomes heroes and villains, princes and princesses, sidekicks and sorcerers—in all-new hand-drawn and CG animation—to celebrate 10 decades of storytelling, artistry and technological achievements.

The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz). But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family’s last hope. The film features songs by Emmy®, GRAMMY® and Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda and is directed by Byron Howard and Jared Bush, co-directed by Charise Castro Smith, and produced by Clark Spencer and Yvett Merino; Bush and Castro Smith are screenwriters on the film.\n\nSee more from official Disney Animation:\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneyanimation\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\r\n\r\nWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

As I wrote in my song, I am not sure where I will land. However, I will take your advice and try to make progress constantly. I will work hard on my weakness. I hope you stay by my side and lead me toward a better stage. \n\nThis song will come out on other music platforms soon.\nI will continue my career posting and creating music.\n\n\n\nFollow me on:\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/ginadeboss\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@ginadeboss\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@ginadeboss\n\n\nAbout Gina:\nBorn in South Korea, half French & half Korean origin.\nNationality: South Korean & French, US Permanent Resident\nModel, Singer & Dancer represented by NY MMG: Oct. 2019 - Oct. 2021\n6 songs released on music platforms including Spotify with the artist name, lil g.
