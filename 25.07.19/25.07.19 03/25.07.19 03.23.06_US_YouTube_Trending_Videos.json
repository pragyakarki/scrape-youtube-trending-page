            "description": "MY BROTHER IS HOME!! 😭✈️ Emotional Missionary Homecoming After 2 Years\n\nAfter two years away, Brock is finally HOME!! He spent the last year and a half serving in Boston, Massachusetts, and this vlog captures the unforgettable moments leading up to his return.

We hope you enjoy this video and consider subscribing if you do, it really helps us out! 🦾\n\nWe’ve got an action packed video this week as we attended the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game, along with media day and the red carpet show. We saw familiar faces and met a bunch of guys for the first time and got to congratulate them on their All-Star nomination, which was so cool. We had a bunch of interviews and hilarious moments throughout the entire trip, so be sure to stick around to the end of the video!\n\nWe said what’s up and interviewed a bunch of players from both the National League and American League, including; Kyle Tucker, Pete Crow-Armstrong, Aroldis Chapman, Logan Webb, Corbin Carroll, Jacob Misiorowski, Jazz Chisholm Jr., Byron Buxton, Steven Kwan, MacKenzie Gore, James Wood, Jacob Wilson, Brendon Donovan, Ryan O’Hearn, Hunter Goodman, Brandon Lowe, Zach McKinstry, \n\nThank you so much to all of the players for their time, we’re so excited to see how all of them continue to ball out in the second half. Also thank you so much to MLB for giving us credentialed access to talk to the games biggest stars on the biggest stage. Finally, thank you to you all for your continued support ❤️ none of this is possible without you guys and we are so grateful to be able to go on these adventures because of you all. Shoutout to everyone that said what’s up to us on the trip, Atlanta was amazing. Stay tuned as we’ve got a LOT more content coming the rest of the summer💯\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this video and want to see more like it, make sure to SUBSCRIBE!

            "description": "This is one of the wildest, most beautiful & most dangerous places to take a 4WD. Out here, you don’t walk the bog holes first… because this is croc country. 🐊\n\nWe’ve been dreaming of this trip for over a decade: 400km of low range through some of the most remote terrain in Australia and half of it might never have been driven before.\n\nWe’re going West to East – right across Cape York – kicking off in Pormpuraaw and heading deep into unknown territory.

                "description": "'Love Island USA' season 7 runners-up Nic Vansteenberghe and Olandria Carthen chat with ET's Brice Sander following the finale, now streaming on Peacock. The pair address denying their feelings for one another after a steamy kiss in Soul Ties, explaining it was a defense mechanism to protect the people they were then-interested in, Cierra Ortega and Taylor Williams. They share where they stand with the ex-Islanders now and whether they're ready to label each other boyfriend and girlfriend ahead of the soon-to-tape reunion, set to premiere on Aug. 25 on Peacock."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard."

Tiene la libertad de elegir otro abogado. Claimsline Group Ltd está autorizada y regulada por la Autoridad de Conducta Financiera (FCA) en lo que respecta a las actividades reguladas de gestión de reclamaciones. El número FRN es 831196. ***La comprobación gratuita de acuerdos se refiere únicamente a la comprobación de crédito blando en vivo que se realiza en línea para identificar sus acuerdos de financiación de automóviles. *Si no gana, no paga: no paga nada a menos que su reclamación sea exitosa. Se aplica una comisión de entre el 18 % y el 36 % (IVA incluido) a las reclamaciones exitosas (la comisión depende del nivel de reparación obtenido) y podría aplicarse una comisión de cancelación fuera del período de reflexión de 14 días. No necesita utilizar una empresa de gestión de reclamaciones para presentar una reclamación; puede hacerlo usted mismo de forma gratuita poniéndose en contacto con el concesionario o la entidad financiera y, si no tiene éxito, puede presentar una reclamación ante el Servicio del Defensor del Pueblo Financiero. Podríamos recibir honorarios por presentarle a un abogado externo o de un panel; esto no afecta la compensación que pueda recibir. En los casos en que se mencionan compensaciones anteriores, Christopher y Joanne Doran obtuvieron la totalidad de la comisión de venta que pagaron, más los intereses (76 % de su prima), mediante acciones legales. Esto difería de las directrices estándar de la FCA, que normalmente solo permitían a los consumidores reclamar comisiones superiores al 50 % de la prima. Sin embargo, se trata de un caso único, no de una comparación sistemática de resultados."

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 our 112th country!\n3:08 boarding our boat\n4:00 our room tours\n7:09 boat layout\n10:00 first sunset & meal onboard\n14:50 emotional morning…\n18:15 nate’s big moment!!!\n23:03 kara’s first elephant babies!!!\n26:39 afternoon onboard\n28:42 crocs, hippos, baboons, more elephants\n33:11 day 3\n34:53 last and BEST floating game drive\n35:38 elephant charge!\n36:40 swimming elephants and hippos!"

            "description": "Bobby Carter | July 11, 2025\nAfter a 16-year hiatus and with no go-to band in place, Clipse's Tiny Desk took lots of time to piece together. At first, I didn't know exactly what they were looking for, in terms of sonics, but it clicked when I was told what they didn't want: no jazzy renditions of their music. They meant no disrespect to jazz at all, and if you follow the duo's music, it boils down to hard drums and even harder synths. Hybrid drummer Daru Jones, who played on last year's Tiny Desk for the LOX, was the first choice because of his unique ability to mix traditional and electronic drum sounds. He provided the authenticity needed for this set, and everything else fell into place.\n\nThe excitement for the Thornton brothers' return reached its apex instantly as someone in the crowd yelled \"Oh my god!\" at the opening note of \"Virginia.\" There was no lull as the band coasted through \"Keys Open Doors\" and \"Momma I'm So Sorry,\" from Clipse's most celebrated album, Hell Hath No Fury. I found so much to analyze witnessing the dichotomy between Pusha T and Malice up close. Malice is more collected in his movements, intensely scouring the room with his eyes while his brother is much more animated, even letting out a sinister laugh mid-set.\n\nRecorded weeks ago, the two performed songs from their new album, Let God Sort Em Out, for the first time, including a chilling dedication to their deceased parents, \"Birds Don't Sing.\" Before the tears from the crowd could dry, we got the moment we'd been waiting for in \"Grindin'.\"\n\nThe first half of the year in hip-hop hasn't been the most exciting, so the timing of this reunion couldn't be better. Here's Clipse delivering its best live performance ever recorded and one of the hardest Tiny Desks of all time.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Virginia\"\n\"Keys Open Doors\"\n\"Momma I'm So Sorry\"\n\"Chains & Whips\"\n\"Birds Don't Sing\"\n\"Grindin'\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPusha T: vocals\nMalice: vocals\nBriley Harris: keys\nDarryl Woodson: keys\nYoo Q!: DJ, background vocals\nDaru Jones: drums\nBrittney Mills: background vocals\nTariq Ali: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

                "description": "Bobby Carter | July 11, 2025\nAfter a 16-year hiatus and with no go-to band in place, Clipse's Tiny Desk took lots of time to piece together. At first, I didn't know exactly what they were looking for, in terms of sonics, but it clicked when I was told what they didn't want: no jazzy renditions of their music. They meant no disrespect to jazz at all, and if you follow the duo's music, it boils down to hard drums and even harder synths. Hybrid drummer Daru Jones, who played on last year's Tiny Desk for the LOX, was the first choice because of his unique ability to mix traditional and electronic drum sounds. He provided the authenticity needed for this set, and everything else fell into place.\n\nThe excitement for the Thornton brothers' return reached its apex instantly as someone in the crowd yelled \"Oh my god!\" at the opening note of \"Virginia.\" There was no lull as the band coasted through \"Keys Open Doors\" and \"Momma I'm So Sorry,\" from Clipse's most celebrated album, Hell Hath No Fury. I found so much to analyze witnessing the dichotomy between Pusha T and Malice up close. Malice is more collected in his movements, intensely scouring the room with his eyes while his brother is much more animated, even letting out a sinister laugh mid-set.\n\nRecorded weeks ago, the two performed songs from their new album, Let God Sort Em Out, for the first time, including a chilling dedication to their deceased parents, \"Birds Don't Sing.\" Before the tears from the crowd could dry, we got the moment we'd been waiting for in \"Grindin'.\"\n\nThe first half of the year in hip-hop hasn't been the most exciting, so the timing of this reunion couldn't be better. Here's Clipse delivering its best live performance ever recorded and one of the hardest Tiny Desks of all time.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Virginia\"\n\"Keys Open Doors\"\n\"Momma I'm So Sorry\"\n\"Chains & Whips\"\n\"Birds Don't Sing\"\n\"Grindin'\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPusha T: vocals\nMalice: vocals\nBriley Harris: keys\nDarryl Woodson: keys\nYoo Q!: DJ, background vocals\nDaru Jones: drums\nBrittney Mills: background vocals\nTariq Ali: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.
