            "description": "[TIME SUBJECT TO CHANGE] This is the fifth fully integrated full stack test flight of Starship and the mighty Super Heavy booster, the largest and most powerful rocket to ever fly. It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. \n\nThe goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-4 in June, 2024. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter in the Indian Ocean about 65 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, on a suborbital trajectory. And perhaps more exciting, this will be the first time SpaceX will be attempting to catch the Super Heavy booster with the launch tower! \n\nGet your tickets to the Astro Awards!!!

                "description": "[TIME SUBJECT TO CHANGE] This is the fifth fully integrated full stack test flight of Starship and the mighty Super Heavy booster, the largest and most powerful rocket to ever fly. It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. \n\nThe goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-4 in June, 2024. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter in the Indian Ocean about 65 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, on a suborbital trajectory. And perhaps more exciting, this will be the first time SpaceX will be attempting to catch the Super Heavy booster with the launch tower! \n\nGet your tickets to the Astro Awards!!!

As many of you may know, I was the singing voice of #Alastor on the #HazbinHotel pilot episode, so it felt only fitting to hire Luximus (known for her work on #HelluvaBoss) to animate this music video! \nHope you enjoy!\n\nBusiness Inquiries: GabrielBrownInfo@gmail.com\n\n\nCREDITS:\n\nWritten by Gabe & Nate brown (Black Gryph0n & Baasik)\n\nProduced by Nate Brown (Baasik): https://www.youtube.com/user/Baasikmusic\n\nPerformed by Gabriel Brown (Black Gryph0n): https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nAnimated by Luximus: https://youtube.com/@Luximus17?si=xzByJGFs_3R5mcpa (https://youtube.com/@Luximus17?si=xzByJGFs_3R5mcpa)\n\nAdditional animation and compositing by Andrew Duemig\n\n\n- -- --- ---- ----- Lyrics ----- ---- --- -- -\n\n\nHey pal, hey friend, hey buddy\nWhy so sad, so downright unhappy?\nThat’s not my cup of tea\n\nYou know that this could be\nYour last day here on earth so buddy, please\nWon’t ya smile just for me?\n\nMy dear, my dear, no you don’t have to cry\nThat ain’t a pretty legacy to leave behind\nStop and smell the roses while you’ve got the time\nPretty soon you’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine \nPretty soon I’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine \n\nYou know I just gotta say\nThat you might not have a lot of time to waste\nSo lose that long face\n\nNone of us are here stay\nSo treat every day like it’s a holiday\nUntil the day you slip away\n\nMy dear, my dear, no you don’t have to cry\nThat ain’t a pretty legacy to leave behind\nStop and smell the roses while you’ve got the time\nPretty soon you’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine \n\nPretty soon you’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine…\n\n\n- -- --- ---- -----END ----- ---- --- -- -\n\n\nHELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nI’m currently stranded in a hotel in Orlando, Florida with my family. Everything is closed, and the surrounding area is flooded. We’re safe though, so we are grateful.\n\nWe’re also grateful that we still have Internet and can upload this video!\n\nHey, did you know “Insane” just broke 100 million views on YouTube? Crazy coincidence we would release the prequel at the exact same time, eh? \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long hiatus. I promise we’re not lazy, we have just been very hard on music for some major IPs, so we can’t talk about it or tease it… we’re very proud of our new music though, and we’re excited for everyone to hear it! Care to guess who we’re working for?… we can’t confirm or deny, but ma\nybe you’ll be right! 👀\n\nThaaaanks!\n\n~Gabe (and Nate)",

As many of you may know, I was the singing voice of #Alastor on the #HazbinHotel pilot episode, so it felt only fitting to hire Luximus (known for her work on #HelluvaBoss) to animate this music video! \nHope you enjoy!\n\nBusiness Inquiries: GabrielBrownInfo@gmail.com\n\n\nCREDITS:\n\nWritten by Gabe & Nate brown (Black Gryph0n & Baasik)\n\nProduced by Nate Brown (Baasik): https://www.youtube.com/user/Baasikmusic\n\nPerformed by Gabriel Brown (Black Gryph0n): https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nAnimated by Luximus: https://youtube.com/@Luximus17?si=xzByJGFs_3R5mcpa (https://youtube.com/@Luximus17?si=xzByJGFs_3R5mcpa)\n\nAdditional animation and compositing by Andrew Duemig\n\n\n- -- --- ---- ----- Lyrics ----- ---- --- -- -\n\n\nHey pal, hey friend, hey buddy\nWhy so sad, so downright unhappy?\nThat’s not my cup of tea\n\nYou know that this could be\nYour last day here on earth so buddy, please\nWon’t ya smile just for me?\n\nMy dear, my dear, no you don’t have to cry\nThat ain’t a pretty legacy to leave behind\nStop and smell the roses while you’ve got the time\nPretty soon you’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine \nPretty soon I’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine \n\nYou know I just gotta say\nThat you might not have a lot of time to waste\nSo lose that long face\n\nNone of us are here stay\nSo treat every day like it’s a holiday\nUntil the day you slip away\n\nMy dear, my dear, no you don’t have to cry\nThat ain’t a pretty legacy to leave behind\nStop and smell the roses while you’ve got the time\nPretty soon you’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine \n\nPretty soon you’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine…\n\n\n- -- --- ---- -----END ----- ---- --- -- -\n\n\nHELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nI’m currently stranded in a hotel in Orlando, Florida with my family. Everything is closed, and the surrounding area is flooded. We’re safe though, so we are grateful.\n\nWe’re also grateful that we still have Internet and can upload this video!\n\nHey, did you know “Insane” just broke 100 million views on YouTube? Crazy coincidence we would release the prequel at the exact same time, eh? \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long hiatus. I promise we’re not lazy, we have just been very hard on music for some major IPs, so we can’t talk about it or tease it… we’re very proud of our new music though, and we’re excited for everyone to hear it! Care to guess who we’re working for?… we can’t confirm or deny, but ma\nybe you’ll be right! 👀\n\nThaaaanks!\n\n~Gabe (and Nate)"

            "description": "Hurricane Milton is the second major hurricane to strike Florida in two weeks, aggressively spinning up to a Category 5 storm in the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall in Sarasota Wednesday night. Milton brought insurmountable storm surge, flooding rains, and produced countless tornadoes which ravaged throughout Florida. This was our experience in Orlando.\n\nThough we suffered a bit of property damage and a sleepless night, feeling very thankful that was the extent of our damages. Our hearts go out to all those affected on the coast; hopefully this is the last storm we have to deal with this year.\n\nFollow us on social: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/krein1ce\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tmartn\nhttps://www.twitter.com/chelseakreiner\nhttps://www.twitter.com/tmartn\nhttps://www.facebook.com/trevandchels\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@trev_and_chels\n\n00:00 Here Comes Another Hurricane\n01:15 We Need to Get Home\n03:10 36 Hours to Prep\n11:45 Disaster Strikes (But It's Not What You Think)\n13:33 Difficult Decisions \n19:05 Frisbee With Coop & Bedtime\n20:26 It's Hurricane Day\n25:42 Tornado Warnings\n26:41 The House is Leaking\n28:27 Hurricane Milton \n34:09 The Damage & Aftermath\n\n#hurricanemilton #hurricane #damage",

                "description": "Hurricane Milton is the second major hurricane to strike Florida in two weeks, aggressively spinning up to a Category 5 storm in the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall in Sarasota Wednesday night. Milton brought insurmountable storm surge, flooding rains, and produced countless tornadoes which ravaged throughout Florida. This was our experience in Orlando.\n\nThough we suffered a bit of property damage and a sleepless night, feeling very thankful that was the extent of our damages. Our hearts go out to all those affected on the coast; hopefully this is the last storm we have to deal with this year.\n\nFollow us on social: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/krein1ce\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tmartn\nhttps://www.twitter.com/chelseakreiner\nhttps://www.twitter.com/tmartn\nhttps://www.facebook.com/trevandchels\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@trev_and_chels\n\n00:00 Here Comes Another Hurricane\n01:15 We Need to Get Home\n03:10 36 Hours to Prep\n11:45 Disaster Strikes (But It's Not What You Think)\n13:33 Difficult Decisions \n19:05 Frisbee With Coop & Bedtime\n20:26 It's Hurricane Day\n25:42 Tornado Warnings\n26:41 The House is Leaking\n28:27 Hurricane Milton \n34:09 The Damage & Aftermath\n\n#hurricanemilton #hurricane #damage"

By experimenting with this setup, I explore whether a magnet can float or move differently inside the sphere due to the electromagnetic effects.

With the first few chimes of the synth and notes from Maria Zardoya’s breathy vocals, the band makes it clear that there’s no better place to bring its bedroom pop style than this slightly bigger space.\n\nThe indie band has been skyrocketing over the last few years with classic Spanglish hits like “Cariño” (featured here at the Desk) and a collab on Bad Bunny’s Un Verano Sin Ti. But there’s so much more to the group than the smooth electronic beats and guitar riffs that meet the ear.\n\nHeaded by Puerto Rican lead singer Maria Zardoya, who proudly places a Puerto Rican flag on the Desk halfway through the show, there is an authenticity to the group’s lyricism and presentation that pulses just beneath the emotive keys. The band’s performance feels like a soundtrack for a generation that exists in many worlds, and in The Marías Tiny Desk viewers find a new, ethereal, welcoming world to belong to.\n\nSET LIST\n“Real Life”\n“Only in My Dreams”\n“No One Noticed”\n“Cariño”\n\nMUSICIANS\nMaría Zardoya: vocals\nJosh Conway: drums\nEddie Friedlander: keys\nJesse Perlman: guitar\nGabriel Steiner: keys, percussion\nDoron Zounes: bass\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

            "description": "Iran has threatened to carry out a further “crushing attack” on Israel, after firing 180 ballistic missiles at its regional enemy.\n\nThe latest warning from Iran came after Israel’s Prime Minister said his country would retaliate for the latest Iranian missile strike.   Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet: “Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.”\n\nIran launched the missiles in retaliation for a series of Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and its capital Beirut which killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior commanders of the Iranian-backed militia group. \n\nIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, described the missiles fired at Israel as “a decisive response to the aggression of the Zionist regime”.  It’s reported that the order to launch the missiles was made personally by Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe Iranian attack came after Israel announced a major ground offensive in southern Lebanon. \n\nAnna Foster in Beirut presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jon Donnison, Lucy Williamson, Orla Guerin and Sarah Smith. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                "description": "Iran has threatened to carry out a further “crushing attack” on Israel, after firing 180 ballistic missiles at its regional enemy.\n\nThe latest warning from Iran came after Israel’s Prime Minister said his country would retaliate for the latest Iranian missile strike.   Mr Netanyahu told his cabinet: “Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.”\n\nIran launched the missiles in retaliation for a series of Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and its capital Beirut which killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior commanders of the Iranian-backed militia group. \n\nIran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, described the missiles fired at Israel as “a decisive response to the aggression of the Zionist regime”.  It’s reported that the order to launch the missiles was made personally by Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe Iranian attack came after Israel announced a major ground offensive in southern Lebanon. \n\nAnna Foster in Beirut presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jon Donnison, Lucy Williamson, Orla Guerin and Sarah Smith. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

            "description": "Check out the clothes we’ve been wearing here: https://glnk.io/3vzrq/thethrottlehouse652\n\nThe 2025 Porsche Spyder RS ($192,600 starting in Canada, $164,200 starting in the US) is a mid-engine roadster with the same 4.0L flat six engine as found in the 911 GT3. And with that engine comes a screaming 9,000 rpm redline, 493 horsepower through natural aspiration, and a 3.2 second claimed 0-60 mph time.

We kindly ask everyone to be mindful of others when commenting. \n\nAs of October 4th, Jillian still has family stranded in Asheville. We recorded this footage to authentically document the situation as it unfolded on the ground and to help spread the word about the catastrophic devastation so more people can help. \n\nWe invite you to join us in praying for and supporting the people affected in Asheville and throughout the states impacted by Helene. \n\nWays You Can Help:\n\n- Support the Hawkins Family Featured in This Video as They Rebuild Their Home!\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-hawkins-family-rebuild-their-home\n\n- Old Europe:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebuild-asheville-and-support-old-europe\n\n- BeLoved Asheville:\n  Venmo:  (https://venmo.com/BeLoved-Asheville)  \n  PayPal: (https://www.paypal.me/BeLovedAsheville)\n\n- MANNA FoodBank:\n Donate Here (https://donate.mannafoodbank.org)\n\n- Asheville Survival Program: \n  Venmo: @AppMedSolid  \n  CashApp: $Streets1de\n\nWhy We Were There:\n\nOn September 25th, we were en route from Indiana to Charlotte, NC, with plans to spend one night in Asheville. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we found ourselves unexpectedly staying through one of the worst natural disasters in American history.\n\nAs Hurricane Helene approached, we began documenting the unfolding events to share the reality on the ground in real time. What started as a simple recording evolved into a short film that felt essential to capture.\n\nWe hope this video offers insight into the rapid, chaotic, and disorienting days leading up to and including Hurricane Helene’s landfall. Watching the footage from NC and neighboring areas, we believe our documentation is vital to understanding how this event unfolded and we hope it inspires you to help in whatever way you can. \n\nThank you for taking the time to watch our video. Our hearts and prayers go out to all those affected by this disaster, and we will continue to keep everyone in our thoughts.\n\nEver Upwards and Shine ON,  \nN + J\n\nFootage Filmed By: The Bergamot (Jillian Speece & Nathaniel Paul Hoff) \n\nVideo Edited By: \nNathaniel Paul Hoff \n\nAdditional Editing By: \nDalton Misner (@daltonmisner) and Molly Elizabeth (@mollyelizabethdesigns) \n\nMore about us:\nMusic: thebergamot.com\nFilm: stateoftheunity.com",

We kindly ask everyone to be mindful of others when commenting. \n\nAs of October 4th, Jillian still has family stranded in Asheville. We recorded this footage to authentically document the situation as it unfolded on the ground and to help spread the word about the catastrophic devastation so more people can help. \n\nWe invite you to join us in praying for and supporting the people affected in Asheville and throughout the states impacted by Helene. \n\nWays You Can Help:\n\n- Support the Hawkins Family Featured in This Video as They Rebuild Their Home!\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-hawkins-family-rebuild-their-home\n\n- Old Europe:\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebuild-asheville-and-support-old-europe\n\n- BeLoved Asheville:\n  Venmo:  (https://venmo.com/BeLoved-Asheville)  \n  PayPal: (https://www.paypal.me/BeLovedAsheville)\n\n- MANNA FoodBank:\n Donate Here (https://donate.mannafoodbank.org)\n\n- Asheville Survival Program: \n  Venmo: @AppMedSolid  \n  CashApp: $Streets1de\n\nWhy We Were There:\n\nOn September 25th, we were en route from Indiana to Charlotte, NC, with plans to spend one night in Asheville. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we found ourselves unexpectedly staying through one of the worst natural disasters in American history.\n\nAs Hurricane Helene approached, we began documenting the unfolding events to share the reality on the ground in real time. What started as a simple recording evolved into a short film that felt essential to capture.\n\nWe hope this video offers insight into the rapid, chaotic, and disorienting days leading up to and including Hurricane Helene’s landfall. Watching the footage from NC and neighboring areas, we believe our documentation is vital to understanding how this event unfolded and we hope it inspires you to help in whatever way you can. \n\nThank you for taking the time to watch our video. Our hearts and prayers go out to all those affected by this disaster, and we will continue to keep everyone in our thoughts.\n\nEver Upwards and Shine ON,  \nN + J\n\nFootage Filmed By: The Bergamot (Jillian Speece & Nathaniel Paul Hoff) \n\nVideo Edited By: \nNathaniel Paul Hoff \n\nAdditional Editing By: \nDalton Misner (@daltonmisner) and Molly Elizabeth (@mollyelizabethdesigns) \n\nMore about us:\nMusic: thebergamot.com\nFilm: stateoftheunity.com"
