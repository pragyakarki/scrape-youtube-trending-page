            "description": "I added humans to Minecraft... it took a year. This was the hardest thing I've ever done, but I'm sure I'll look back on it fondly in the future.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nGeorge: https://www.youtube.com/GeorgeNotFound\nSapnap: https://www.youtube.com/Sapnap\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nThank you guys so much for all the support throughout the years. It was the 5th year anniversary of \"Dream\" recently, and I am so appreciative for all of your support. Thank you to Youtube for all of the support, and for allowing me to live out my dreams.\n\nI'm calling this project \"Fusion\", game fusion, minecraft fusion, real life fusion, just fusion really. We fused real life and Minecraft, and hopefully other games soon. It's pretty awesome!\n\nThis took over a year to make, and I plan on using it for a ton of future stuff, including \"Manhunt 2\" which should premiere in around two weeks. It should be a blast from the past, and from the future, with all the awesome tech. There is so much more cool stuff to show, but you can wait for that, as it's all coming up.\n\nThank you to my friends for helping me during this project, believing that I could accomplish it, and motivating me to keep going hard at it. I had to learn multiple new coding languages, tons of random bits of knowledge on cameras, 3D space, and even unfortunately MATH. I feel very accomplished right now, but the grind doesn't stop. See you soon!",

                "description": "I added humans to Minecraft... it took a year. This was the hardest thing I've ever done, but I'm sure I'll look back on it fondly in the future.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nGeorge: https://www.youtube.com/GeorgeNotFound\nSapnap: https://www.youtube.com/Sapnap\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nThank you guys so much for all the support throughout the years. It was the 5th year anniversary of \"Dream\" recently, and I am so appreciative for all of your support. Thank you to Youtube for all of the support, and for allowing me to live out my dreams.\n\nI'm calling this project \"Fusion\", game fusion, minecraft fusion, real life fusion, just fusion really. We fused real life and Minecraft, and hopefully other games soon. It's pretty awesome!\n\nThis took over a year to make, and I plan on using it for a ton of future stuff, including \"Manhunt 2\" which should premiere in around two weeks. It should be a blast from the past, and from the future, with all the awesome tech. There is so much more cool stuff to show, but you can wait for that, as it's all coming up.\n\nThank you to my friends for helping me during this project, believing that I could accomplish it, and motivating me to keep going hard at it. I had to learn multiple new coding languages, tons of random bits of knowledge on cameras, 3D space, and even unfortunately MATH. I feel very accomplished right now, but the grind doesn't stop. See you soon!"

Turns out these terminals are likely making them a lot of money. \n\nThe estimated $2 billion profit from SOTs is based on a supposed 15% profit increase at McDonald’s Germany. When this figure is conservatively extrapolated to the chain’s global operations over the past few years, it suggests a significant increase in overall profit, potentially reaching billions. McDonald’s annual profit is approximately $13-14 billion.\n\nSources: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1vyWqJcXFvckaEOU2rc4_KjH6UDLNU2O_poAhM5h-i-M/edit?usp=sharing \n\nMusic\n\nEpidemic Sound:\n\nAlec Slayne - The Search for More\nAlec Slayne - Under Purple Skies\nCharles Holme - Change by Reversal\nCharles Holme - Dark Dripping\nCharles Holme - Tarnishing Memories\nChristoffer Moe Ditlevsen - Cloak\nChristoffer Moe Ditlevsen - Infiltrator\nDream Cave - Confidentiality\nDream Cave - Dead Alley\nDream Cave - Natural Inclination\nDream Cave - Silent Witness\nFredrik Ekstrom - Devils On The Doorstep 1\nSilver Maple - Impasse\n\n_____\n\nArmchair documentaries, almost weekly",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

            "description": "Watch the trailer now - See it in theatres September 13!\n\nWriter-director Kevin Smith presents his most personal film to date with this coming-of-age story — set in the summer of 1986 — that follows three sixteen-year-old friends who spend their Saturdays sneaking into movies at the local cineplex. When one of the guys invites the girl of his dreams to see an R-rated film, all hilarity breaks loose, as a self-important theater manager (Ken Jeong) and teen rivalries interfere with his best-laid plans. Justin Long, Rosario Dawson, Jason Biggs, and more contribute outrageous characters to this poignant comic valentine to moviegoing and the youth of the ’80s.\n\r\nAttend the World Premiere at the same theater in the movie! ►► https://the430.movie/\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

                "description": "Watch the trailer now - See it in theatres September 13!\n\nWriter-director Kevin Smith presents his most personal film to date with this coming-of-age story — set in the summer of 1986 — that follows three sixteen-year-old friends who spend their Saturdays sneaking into movies at the local cineplex. When one of the guys invites the girl of his dreams to see an R-rated film, all hilarity breaks loose, as a self-important theater manager (Ken Jeong) and teen rivalries interfere with his best-laid plans. Justin Long, Rosario Dawson, Jason Biggs, and more contribute outrageous characters to this poignant comic valentine to moviegoing and the youth of the ’80s.\n\r\nAttend the World Premiere at the same theater in the movie! ►► https://the430.movie/\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

                "description": "Read more: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a61692733/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-revealed/\n\nThe 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1 has a 1064-hp twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8, making it by far the most powerful Vette to ever reach production.\n\nThe ZR1's LT7 engine also makes it the first turbocharged Corvette, and its myriad upgrades distinguish it from the Z06's naturally aspirated LT6.\n\nWith an estimated top speed of 215-plus mph, an available aero kit that nets up to 1200 pounds of downforce, and other exotic bits, the C8 ZR1 is set up to slay supercars.\n\nThe GM engineers who developed the new C8 Corvette ZR1 said it was obvious early on that they were dealing with something special. During its first drag-strip launch, the rear-drive mid-engined monster roared through the quarter-mile in under 10 seconds. During its first lap at GM's Milford Proving Grounds, it posted a faster top speed than the previous-gen ZR1. At Germany's famous Nürburgring racetrack, all four Corvette test drivers eclipsed 200 mph on their first laps. And the firsts don't stop there. The 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1 is also the first turbocharged Vette and the first production model to produce 1064(!) horsepower.\n\nSubscribe to Car and Driver http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoCARandDRIVER\n\n00:00 Going 200-plus mph\n00:53 The ZTK Track Performance Package\n01:32 1064 hp, twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8\n03:17 Turbo boost management\n03:58 Torque\n05:17 \"We've burned up a lot of dynos.\" \n06:16 The exhaust generates thrust (and flames) \n07:52 Air inlets and management\n10:35 Top speed and quarter mile\n11:35 Carbon ceramic brake rotors and carbon fiber wheels\n14:59 ZR1 Convertible\n17:54 Differences in ride quality \n19:00 Sacrificing the front storage area\n20:03 A window for the engine \n20:40 Coupe vs convertible performance differences\n21:43 Tadge Juechter on retiring and working on the first ZR1\n23:30 ZR1 versus powerful EVs\n24:01 80 mph to 200 mph and back \n25:23 Convertible operation\n26:54 Availability"

            "description": "Wow, the new Corvette ZR1 is quite something. For a start, one thousand and sixty-four horsepower is nothing short of A LOT. In fact, it’s nearly 400 more than the Corvette Z06, and higher than the likes of the Ferrari SF90 XX, let alone hybrid-assisted hypercars such as the McLaren P1, LaFerrari and Porsche 918.\n\nAnd yet, all that power comes from a solitary 5.5-litre, twin-turbocharged V8, with not a jot of a hybrid system in sight. Which also means the ZR1 is rear-wheel drive only – and it doesn’t take a genius to work out that’s over 500hp per back tyre…\n\nThere is more to the 2025 Corvette ZR1 than just its peak power output though, so over to Top Gear’s Contributing Editor, Jethro Bovingdon, for a deep dive on how GM created a new ‘King of the Hill’…\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks \nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

            "description": "When you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you. Joker: Folie À Deux – only in theaters and IMAX, October 4. #JokerMovie #FilmedForIMAX \n\nFrom acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes “Joker: Folie À Deux,” the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Academy Award-winning “Joker,” which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.  The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar winner Lady Gaga (“A Star Is Born”).\n\n“Joker: Folie À Deux” finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (“The Banshees of Inisherin”) and Catherine Keener (“Get Out,” “Capote”), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from “Joker.”\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing “Joker,” directed “Joker: Folie À Deux” from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC.  The film was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner.  Lady Gaga served as music consultant.  The film’s executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg and Jason Ruder.\n\nWorking with Phillips behind the camera are his team from “Joker,” including Oscar-nominated director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberg, Oscar-nominated editor Jeff Groth, and composer Hildur Guđnadóttir, who won the Oscar for her work on the first film.  New to the team is Oscar-nominated costume designer Arianne Phillips (“Once Upon a Time in… Hollywood,” “Don’t Worry Darling”).  Ruder is the film’s executive music producer and the music supervisors are Randall Poster and George Drakoulias.  Casting is by Francine Maisler (the “Dune” films, “Challengers”).\n\nWarner Bros.

Joker: Folie À Deux – only in theaters and IMAX, October 4. #JokerMovie #FilmedForIMAX \n\nFrom acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes “Joker: Folie À Deux,” the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Academy Award-winning “Joker,” which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.  The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar winner Lady Gaga (“A Star Is Born”).\n\n“Joker: Folie À Deux” finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (“The Banshees of Inisherin”) and Catherine Keener (“Get Out,” “Capote”), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from “Joker.”\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing “Joker,” directed “Joker: Folie À Deux” from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC.  The film was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner.  Lady Gaga served as music consultant.  The film’s executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg and Jason Ruder.\n\nWorking with Phillips behind the camera are his team from “Joker,” including Oscar-nominated director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberg, Oscar-nominated editor Jeff Groth, and composer Hildur Guđnadóttir, who won the Oscar for her work on the first film.  New to the team is Oscar-nominated costume designer Arianne Phillips (“Once Upon a Time in… Hollywood,” “Don’t Worry Darling”).  Ruder is the film’s executive music producer and the music supervisors are Randall Poster and George Drakoulias.  Casting is by Francine Maisler (the “Dune” films, “Challengers”).\n\nWarner Bros.
