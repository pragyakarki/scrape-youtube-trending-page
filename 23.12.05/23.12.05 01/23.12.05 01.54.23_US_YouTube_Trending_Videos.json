I’ve never done a collaboration like this before but it was wonderful to get the chance to work with and promote a smaller, up-and-coming channel. I’ve no doubt you’ll all be hearing about them any day now. I see big things!\n\nIn all seriousness though, WOW. As a long-time fan of the theory channels getting to work on this with MatPat and his team was such an honour. This project has been in the works for the longest time and it’s been so hard to keep it a secret for all this time! (Wondering why there are no Style Theory lyrics? That channel didn’t exist when this was written!)\n\nI am so incredibly grateful to the whole theory team for this opportunity. In fact, I’m doubly thankful because when I initially pitched this project to them the idea was that I would have the song to publish on my music platforms but that the music video would go to the Game Theory channel. But after work on the project began MatPat said he wanted to find a way to make sure the collaboration benefited my channel as much as possible, instead gifting the full music video to my channel even though it had been entirely edited by the Game Theory team. (Shout out to the wonderfully talented Tyler Mascola!)\n\nSo, instead a plan was formulated to feature the music video as part of a larger Theory video whilst the full standalone music video would be here! I cannot express enough my gratitude to Matt and the whole team. Every one of them was a joy to work with as we put this together.\n\nSo, if you’re new here, joining me from today’s video over on Game Theory, welcome!

In fact, I’m doubly thankful because when I initially pitched this project to them the idea was that I would have the song to publish on my music platforms but that the music video would go to the Game Theory channel. But after work on the project began MatPat said he wanted to find a way to make sure the collaboration benefited my channel as much as possible, instead gifting the full music video to my channel even though it had been entirely edited by the Game Theory team. (Shout out to the wonderfully talented Tyler Mascola!)\n\nSo, instead a plan was formulated to feature the music video as part of a larger Theory video whilst the full standalone music video would be here! I cannot express enough my gratitude to Matt and the whole team. Every one of them was a joy to work with as we put this together.\n\nSo, if you’re new here, joining me from today’s video over on Game Theory, welcome! I hope you like what you find!\n\nA̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶a̶b̶s̶o̶l̶u̶t̶e̶l̶y̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶t̶h̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶.̶\n\n#gametheory #matpat\n\n-----\nCheck out the full Stupendium originals playlist for all of my original songs!\n\nSTUPENDIUM ORIGINALS: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA&si=dAL0rsUtYfPoESB5\n\nTHE STUPENDIUM ON SPOTIFY:\nhttp://bit.ly/Stupendify\n\nTHE STUPENDIUM ON iTUNES:\nhttp://bit.ly/StupendiTunes\n\nLyrics and vocals by The Stupendium\nVideo by The Stupendium and Theorist Media\nEdited by Tyler Mascola\nShoot Coordinator: Lizzy CJ\nTrack produced by @OxygenBeats \n\n-----\n\nYou can support The Stupendium on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/thestupendium\n\nGrab your official Stupendium Merchandise!

            "description": "Mat has returned to the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin Texas, and he’s got his hands on the all-new Cybertruck! So of course, you know what that means… It’s drag race time! \n\nNaturally, there was only one competitor that we had to compare this all-electric pick-up to - the Hummer EV! The question is, which will come out on top? \n\nWell, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. \n\nThink that’s heavy? Well, that’s nothing compared to the Hummer, which comes in at 4,110kg!! Just like the Tesla, the Hummer is equipped with three motors, but it’s also up on power, producing 1,014hp and 1,485Nm!

                "description": "Mat has returned to the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin Texas, and he’s got his hands on the all-new Cybertruck! So of course, you know what that means… It’s drag race time! \n\nNaturally, there was only one competitor that we had to compare this all-electric pick-up to - the Hummer EV! The question is, which will come out on top? \n\nWell, let’s check out the stats. Starting with the Cybertruck, it rolls up equipped with three electric motors, and they combine to produce 845hp and 930Nm of torque. The starting price of the dual-motor edition is around $49,000, but for this tri-motor Cyberbeast edition, it’ll cost you around $96,000! In terms of weight, the Cybertruck tips the scales at just over 3 tonnes. \n\nThink that’s heavy? Well, that’s nothing compared to the Hummer, which comes in at 4,110kg!! Just like the Tesla, the Hummer is equipped with three motors, but it’s also up on power, producing 1,014hp and 1,485Nm! The price is also slightly higher than the Cybertruck, coming in at around £109,000.\n\nSo how will this one play out? Will the extra tonne of weight prove decisive?

            "title": "Exclusive 2024 Tesla Cybertruck Full Review & Drag Race w R1T & Hummer  — Jason Cammisa on the ICONS",
            "description": "In this world-exclusive comprehensive First Review of the Tesla Cybertruck, Jason Cammisa tests Tesla’s Cyberbeast — in acceleration, handling, maneuverability, dent-resistance, and safety — and races it down the ¼-mile against the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD and GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup.\n\n==\nThis episode of “Jason Cammisa on the ICONS” is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nFor more info on the Cybertruck, watch Jason's \"Carmudgeon Show\" podcast here: https://youtu.be/NjIPEtegPt4\n\nNo episode of the multiple award-winning series “ICONS” would be complete without a full helping of comedy, two side dishes of crazy action, and a cast of supporting characters. In this case, the latter incudes a 1988 Lamborghini LM002, a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12, a Ford Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV Pickup! \n\nSpecial guest appearances include Hall-of-Fame race-car driver Randy Pobst and \"Engineering Explained\" host Jason Fenske.\n\nCammisa explains the engineering behind Tesla's controversial pickup truck, including its stainless-steel (\"HFS\") exoskeleton construction, enormous aluminum castings and structural battery pack. He attends a live side-impact crash test in Tesla's Crash Lab that demonstrated how tough the skin is. And then, of course, tries to dent it with a sledgehammer. Or BFH, for those who know.\n\nThe similarities with the DeLorean go way beyond the stainless exterior — in fact, the Cybertruck most closely resembles the famed Lamborghini LM002 pickup — a V12-powered dogleg 5-speed off-roader, dubbed \"Rambo Lambo,\" that was as fast as a sports car. In fact, Jason reads an excerpt from the original Car and Driver magazine review of the LM002, and everything said applies directly to the Cybertruck.\n\nIncluding that the Cybertruck Cyberbeast is the quickest-accelerating pickup truck in history. Watch as it leaves the previous champion (the Rivian R1T) for dead, hitting 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and blasting through the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds at 119 mph. Cammisa reran the test on untreated (non-VHT) asphalt and got the same numbers — and marvels at how consistently the Cybertruck accelerated. Even with the Battery SoC in the mid-30-percent range after hours of consecutive runs, it still hit 60 in 2.6 seconds, and had only lost 0.3s at the quarter mile.\n\nThat newfound consistency is partially due to the new 4680 Gen 2 batteries, which are far larger than Tesla's previous 18650 and 2170 batteries, and are manufactured in-house.\n\nThe Cybertruck is nearly twice as efficient as the Hummer EV, thanks to a Lotus-like obsession with efficiency. With a battery pack of just 123 kWh, it's expected to receive an EPA Range of over 310 miles. \n\nAnd the Cybertruck is even lighter than the Rivian R1T, Hummer, and Lightning — Cammisa weighed them all. \n\nCURB WEIGHT:\nCybertruck Cyberbeast  6717 lb\nRivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD 6777 lb\nFord F-150 Lightning 6813 lb\nGMC Hummer EV First Edition 9316 lb\nLamborghini LM002 6499 lb (with 20 gallons of fuel)\n\nOf course, don't miss Randy Pobst in a kart chasing the Cybertruck around Sonoma Raceway's Go-Kart track — or the sight of the LM002 leaning over like it's about to roll down Sonoma's famed Carousel. Or Jason backing into a stainless steel refrigerator because the Cybertruck's rear visibility is so compromised.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Cybertruck Is Real!\n1:18 Why The Cybertruck Looks Like It Does\n2:18 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs Rivian R1T Quad-Motor\n3:50 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs GMC Hummer EV\n4:25 Quickest Pickup In History: 0-60 in 2.6!\n5:20 Tesla's Engineering Efficiency\n6:23 Refrigerator Aerodynamics\n7:35 New 4860 Gen 2 Batteries\n8:11 Tesla's Price Cuts — Vertical Integration\n9:25 Jason Fenske on the Benefits of High Voltage\n10:14 48 Volts!\n11:07 How To Engineer a 48 Volt Vehicle\n11:24 Steer By Wire\n12:06 Turning Radius and Steering Demonstration\n13:07 Cybertruck vs. Go-Kart (maneuverability demo)\n16:02 One Million Pre-Orders\n16:33 Similarities to Delorean DMC-12\n17:44 Sledgehammer Door Ding Test\n18:08 Bulletproof HFS: \"Hard F-ing Steel\"\n18:44 Cybertruck Crash Test\n19:28 Tesla's Safety Record\n20:06 Pedestrian Impact Protection\n20:38 I hate it.

                "title": "Exclusive 2024 Tesla Cybertruck Full Review & Drag Race w R1T & Hummer  — Jason Cammisa on the ICONS",
                "description": "In this world-exclusive comprehensive First Review of the Tesla Cybertruck, Jason Cammisa tests Tesla’s Cyberbeast — in acceleration, handling, maneuverability, dent-resistance, and safety — and races it down the ¼-mile against the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD and GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup.\n\n==\nThis episode of “Jason Cammisa on the ICONS” is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nFor more info on the Cybertruck, watch Jason's \"Carmudgeon Show\" podcast here: https://youtu.be/NjIPEtegPt4\n\nNo episode of the multiple award-winning series “ICONS” would be complete without a full helping of comedy, two side dishes of crazy action, and a cast of supporting characters. In this case, the latter incudes a 1988 Lamborghini LM002, a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12, a Ford Lightning, Rivian R1T, and GMC Hummer EV Pickup! \n\nSpecial guest appearances include Hall-of-Fame race-car driver Randy Pobst and \"Engineering Explained\" host Jason Fenske.\n\nCammisa explains the engineering behind Tesla's controversial pickup truck, including its stainless-steel (\"HFS\") exoskeleton construction, enormous aluminum castings and structural battery pack. He attends a live side-impact crash test in Tesla's Crash Lab that demonstrated how tough the skin is. And then, of course, tries to dent it with a sledgehammer. Or BFH, for those who know.\n\nThe similarities with the DeLorean go way beyond the stainless exterior — in fact, the Cybertruck most closely resembles the famed Lamborghini LM002 pickup — a V12-powered dogleg 5-speed off-roader, dubbed \"Rambo Lambo,\" that was as fast as a sports car. In fact, Jason reads an excerpt from the original Car and Driver magazine review of the LM002, and everything said applies directly to the Cybertruck.\n\nIncluding that the Cybertruck Cyberbeast is the quickest-accelerating pickup truck in history. Watch as it leaves the previous champion (the Rivian R1T) for dead, hitting 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and blasting through the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds at 119 mph. Cammisa reran the test on untreated (non-VHT) asphalt and got the same numbers — and marvels at how consistently the Cybertruck accelerated. Even with the Battery SoC in the mid-30-percent range after hours of consecutive runs, it still hit 60 in 2.6 seconds, and had only lost 0.3s at the quarter mile.\n\nThat newfound consistency is partially due to the new 4680 Gen 2 batteries, which are far larger than Tesla's previous 18650 and 2170 batteries, and are manufactured in-house.\n\nThe Cybertruck is nearly twice as efficient as the Hummer EV, thanks to a Lotus-like obsession with efficiency. With a battery pack of just 123 kWh, it's expected to receive an EPA Range of over 310 miles. \n\nAnd the Cybertruck is even lighter than the Rivian R1T, Hummer, and Lightning — Cammisa weighed them all. \n\nCURB WEIGHT:\nCybertruck Cyberbeast  6717 lb\nRivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD 6777 lb\nFord F-150 Lightning 6813 lb\nGMC Hummer EV First Edition 9316 lb\nLamborghini LM002 6499 lb (with 20 gallons of fuel)\n\nOf course, don't miss Randy Pobst in a kart chasing the Cybertruck around Sonoma Raceway's Go-Kart track — or the sight of the LM002 leaning over like it's about to roll down Sonoma's famed Carousel. Or Jason backing into a stainless steel refrigerator because the Cybertruck's rear visibility is so compromised.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Cybertruck Is Real!\n1:18 Why The Cybertruck Looks Like It Does\n2:18 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs Rivian R1T Quad-Motor\n3:50 Drag Race: CyberBeast vs GMC Hummer EV\n4:25 Quickest Pickup In History: 0-60 in 2.6!\n5:20 Tesla's Engineering Efficiency\n6:23 Refrigerator Aerodynamics\n7:35 New 4860 Gen 2 Batteries\n8:11 Tesla's Price Cuts — Vertical Integration\n9:25 Jason Fenske on the Benefits of High Voltage\n10:14 48 Volts!\n11:07 How To Engineer a 48 Volt Vehicle\n11:24 Steer By Wire\n12:06 Turning Radius and Steering Demonstration\n13:07 Cybertruck vs. Go-Kart (maneuverability demo)\n16:02 One Million Pre-Orders\n16:33 Similarities to Delorean DMC-12\n17:44 Sledgehammer Door Ding Test\n18:08 Bulletproof HFS: \"Hard F-ing Steel\"\n18:44 Cybertruck Crash Test\n19:28 Tesla's Safety Record\n20:06 Pedestrian Impact Protection\n20:38 I hate it.

            "description": "This is her Odyssey. #Furiosa - Only in Theaters 2024\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Academy Award-winning mastermind George Miller’s “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” the much-anticipated return to the iconic dystopian world he created more than 30 years ago with the seminal “Mad Max” films.  Miller now turns the page again with an all-new original, standalone action adventure that will reveal the origins of the powerhouse character from the multiple Oscar-winning global smash “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  The new feature from Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures is produced by Miller and his longtime partner, Oscar-nominated producer Doug Mitchell (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Babe”), under their Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner. \n\nAs the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus.  Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.  While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.\n\nTaylor-Joy stars in the title role, and along with Hemsworth, the film also stars Alyla Browne and Tom Burke. \n\nMiller penned the script with “Mad Max: Fury Road” co-writer Nico Lathouris.  Miller’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris, director of photography Simon Duggan (“Hacksaw Ridge,” “The Great Gatsby”), composer Tom Holkenborg, sound designer Robert Mackenzie, editor Eliot Knapman, visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson and colorist Eric Whipp. The team also includes other longtime collaborators: production designer Colin Gibson, editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, each of whom won an Oscar for their work on “Mad Max: Fury Road.” \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, A Kennedy Miller Mitchell Production, A George Miller Film, “Furiosa.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, in theaters only nationwide on May 24, 2024 and internationally beginning on May 22, 2024.",

This is one of my favorite songs I have every written. Thank you for taking the time and continuing to allow me to use my platform to spread positivity through impactful music for the people.

Share it with anyone and everyone and let's make an IMPACT with music for the people, spread BY THE PEOPLE. Love you all.\n\nClick here to listen:\n\nhttps://dax.lnk.to/whatislife\n\nFollow DAX: @ thatsdax\nShot by: Logan Meis\nProduced by: Lex Nour Beats\n\n#catchtherain #dax #pain #hiphop #mentalhealth #rap\n\nLYRICS:\n\nEveryday I pray that all this pain will go away\nI hold my faith and trust that God's gonna lead the way\nI know i'll make it through the storm and through the rain\nand I wont break until I see a brighter day\n\nThe pain never goes away\nI suppress these feelings in my chest \nthen they move up to my neck and decapitate\nI’m obsessed with time \nI know I can’t get it back\nSo when I catch my head it’s only half the weight(wait)\nI smile on sadder-days(saturdays)\nThe WEAKends when I strengthen and deactivate \nAnd then Monday comes around \nAnd I relive the same\nThis cycle is storm I chase\nBut I can’t seem to catch the rain\n\nIt’s war when I’m in the booth\nJust me inside a room man this liquor always tells the truth\nI got my phone inside my hand but I turn off my notification cause the sight of one could f*ck around and change my mood\nI hit record\nMy life’s melodic pain they’ve never heard before \nthey get addicted to that sound and then I make them more and now I understand why they say when it rains it pours\nDon’t want to live my life inside this cage\nI’m stuck in retrograde\nAs history repeats itself I seclude myself and ask for SPACE i think I’m planted(planet) in this storm \nBut I can’t catch the rain cover up of mask the pain I think I gotta\n\nThe pain never goes away\nI suppress these feelings in my chest then they move up to my neck and decapitate\nI’m obsessed with time \nI know i can’t get it back\nSo when I catch my head it’s only half the weight(wait)\nI smile on sadder-days(saturdays)\nThe weekends when I strengthen and deactivate \nAnd then Monday comes around \nAnd I relive the same\nThis cycle is storm I chase\nBut I can’t seem to catch the rain\n\nI’m having trouble getting used to me\nCause I remember how it used to be\nI meet new people everyday and you see usually I don’t know if they like me or they’re motherF*cking using me and that’s why I’m just\nClosed off and anti-social\nIn and out of conversations I’m compensating my musics my excuse to say I’m vocal \nMy greatest hits are my worst times compiled I bottled up then shared to the world and that what’s made them global \nAnd that’s the f*cked up part popping prescriptions while giving vivid descriptions to people who clap listen while you stuck inside a prison slave to the algorithm cope with the mechanisms like liquor and chasing women \nBut that’s what they want\nThen you wake up and it’s all over \nlife is nothing but a vapor once you blink you’re older, your heart gets colder\nThey metal in your mind the system you gave your whole lifetime implodes and starts to corrode ya \nyou looking over your shoulder thinking how you supposed to get through this life while being sober?\nYou lose composure get to drinking for the closure then you right back in the cycle where those motherf*ckas want you saying\n\nThe pain never goes away\nI suppress these feelings in my chest then \nthey move up to my neck and decapitate\nI’m obsessed with time \nI know i can’t get it back\nSo when I catch my head it’s only half the weight(wait)\nI smile on sadder-days(saturdays)\nThe weekends when I strengthen and deactivate \nAnd then Monday comes around \nAnd I relive the same\nThis cycle is storm I chase\nBut I can’t seem to catch the rain\n\nEveryday I pray that all this pain will go away\nI hold my faith and trust that God's gonna lead the way\nI know i'll make it through the storm and through the rain\nand I wont break until I see a brighter day\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs always if you made it this far in the description you are an ABSOLUTE REAL ONE. This is one of my favorite songs I have every written. Thank you for taking the time and continuing to allow me to use my platform to spread positivity through impactful music for the people. Let's keep sharing. Someone out there needs to hear this. Love you all..."

            "description": "It’s been four years since the Cybertruck was revealed… And the time has finally come for Mat to see it in the flesh! \n\nHe’s flown over to the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin, Texas to see the very first Cybertrucks roll off the production line before they’re handed over to customers, and he’s about to see if the most anticipated car in the world really lives up to the hype! \n\nNaturally, an event such as this is no small celebration! The Gigafactory site is littered in Cybertrucks, and Mat will have a chance to walk through the factory to take a look under the skin and find out just how impressive it is. Not only that, he’ll get a chance to sit inside the Cybertruck to take a closer look at the build quality, while also asking other attendees what they make of this ultra-impressive pick-up! \n\n…Oh, and a certain someone called Elon will be in attendance, too.\n\nSo what do you think - will the Cybertruck live up to the hype?! And will Mat be so impressed that he actually puts a deposit down?! You’ll need to stick with him for this factory walkaround to see for yourself!",

A natural draft furnace is one where the draft is supplied by convection alone. This is opposed to a forced draft where bellows or fan is used to supply air flow instead. Natural draft furnaces are typically taller than forced draft furnaces to make use of the stack effect. They also often have multiple large air entries or tuyeres to help reduce resistance to air flow. Natural draft furnaces where used to smelt iron in ancient times in Europe and up to more recently in Africa where some are still standing. The lack of the need for bellows reduces labor and complexity.\n\nThe furnace was 1.5 m tall and 25 cm internal diameter with 4 tuyeres 5 cm internal diameter. Charcoal was used as a fuel and iron bacteria was used as an ore. The smelt produced about 4 g of iron prills but could probably be improved with a longer preheat and a higher charcoal to or ratio. A second smelt was run with slag from previous smelts using 8 tuyeres this time to increase air flow.  But it made only about a gram of iron, possibly due to the slag not having much iron left in it. \n\nNatural draft furnaces do not rely on bellows or blowers and so labor is significantly decreased during a smelt. They are also simpler to operate with less components to break down or maintain. However, I've read that they use more charcoal per iron made, possibly because part of the energy from the fuel goes into supplying the air flow through the furnace. With further experimentation, I believe that my natural draft furnaces can make better yields of iron.\n\n\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Ted may be a lousy influence on John, but at the end of the day, he’s a loyal pal who’s always willing to go out on a limb for friendship.\n\n#Peacock #ted #OfficialTrailer\n\nPeacock is your go-to for hit movies, TV, live sports, and more.

            "title": "The rise of Xi Jinping, explained",
            "description": "How Xi Jinping became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nXi Jinping, president of China and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is one of the most powerful political figures in the world. By initiating an unprecedented third term as China’s leader in October, 2022, Xi has signaled that he may plan to remain in power for life – making him the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong to hold unchecked power over the People’s Republic of China. \n\nBut Xi’s connection to Mao goes deeper than a shared outlook that emphasizes unifying the party around a single leader. When Xi was just a young boy, his family – who had held elite party status thanks to his father’s pivotal role in Mao's “Long March” in 1935 – was denounced during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a chaotic decade of purges and persecution that saw even Mao’s closest allies removed from power. During this time, a teenaged Xi was forced to work hard labor in the countryside outside of Beijing, and his father was imprisoned. \n\nXi’s subsequent rise after Mao died in 1976 was a methodical process in using his restored elite status as leverage to gain prominent party positions in rural provinces around China, culminating in his promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007.\n\nFrom there, Xi pulled from Mao’s playbook: purging his political rivals and promoting those with whom he shared close personal ties. This process undid the work of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, to prevent the consolidation of power around a single leader in China. \n\nBy the time his third term began in October 2022, Xi had reshaped the party and Chinese military leadership to be fully packed with Xi loyalists. And even in the face of social upheaval surrounding his failed Zero Covid policy, Xi has shown no sign of giving up any of the power he has consolidated since taking over as leader of the country. \n\n\nFurther reading: \n\nThese books and podcasts below helped us understand Xi Jinping’s rise, Xi’s similarities to Mao, how politics changed in the PRC since its founding, and the structure and culture of the CCP:\n\nCoalitions of the Weak by Victor Shih (Associate Professor in China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego)\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/coalitions-of-the-weak/6E99B6DB73F934166175D872B51DACD0 \n\nChinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era by Cheng Li (scholar and expert in Chinese elite politics) \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/books/chinese-politics-in-the-xi-jinping-era/ \n\nParty of One by Chun Han Wong (Reporter at the Wall Street Journal) \nhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Party-of-One/Chun-Han-Wong/9781982185732\n\nWealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-first Century by Orville Schell and John Delury \nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/161758/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury/\n\nThe Prince by Sue-Lin Wong (Correspondent at The Economist) \nhttps://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-prince\n\nThese databases and papers were also helpful in gaining a better understanding of Xi Jinping’s alliances and the CCP structure under his terms: \n\nDecoding Chinese Politics interactive by Asia Society Policy Institute \nhttps://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/decoding-chinese-politics\n\nCCP Elite Database by UCSD/Victor Shih\nhttps://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/elites/\n\nChina’s Political System in Charts: A Snapshot Before the 20th Party Congress by Susan V.

                "description": "How Xi Jinping became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nXi Jinping, president of China and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is one of the most powerful political figures in the world. By initiating an unprecedented third term as China’s leader in October, 2022, Xi has signaled that he may plan to remain in power for life – making him the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong to hold unchecked power over the People’s Republic of China. \n\nBut Xi’s connection to Mao goes deeper than a shared outlook that emphasizes unifying the party around a single leader. When Xi was just a young boy, his family – who had held elite party status thanks to his father’s pivotal role in Mao's “Long March” in 1935 – was denounced during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a chaotic decade of purges and persecution that saw even Mao’s closest allies removed from power. During this time, a teenaged Xi was forced to work hard labor in the countryside outside of Beijing, and his father was imprisoned. \n\nXi’s subsequent rise after Mao died in 1976 was a methodical process in using his restored elite status as leverage to gain prominent party positions in rural provinces around China, culminating in his promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007.\n\nFrom there, Xi pulled from Mao’s playbook: purging his political rivals and promoting those with whom he shared close personal ties. This process undid the work of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, to prevent the consolidation of power around a single leader in China. \n\nBy the time his third term began in October 2022, Xi had reshaped the party and Chinese military leadership to be fully packed with Xi loyalists. And even in the face of social upheaval surrounding his failed Zero Covid policy, Xi has shown no sign of giving up any of the power he has consolidated since taking over as leader of the country. \n\n\nFurther reading: \n\nThese books and podcasts below helped us understand Xi Jinping’s rise, Xi’s similarities to Mao, how politics changed in the PRC since its founding, and the structure and culture of the CCP:\n\nCoalitions of the Weak by Victor Shih (Associate Professor in China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego)\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/coalitions-of-the-weak/6E99B6DB73F934166175D872B51DACD0 \n\nChinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era by Cheng Li (scholar and expert in Chinese elite politics) \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/books/chinese-politics-in-the-xi-jinping-era/ \n\nParty of One by Chun Han Wong (Reporter at the Wall Street Journal) \nhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Party-of-One/Chun-Han-Wong/9781982185732\n\nWealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-first Century by Orville Schell and John Delury \nhttps://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/161758/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury/\n\nThe Prince by Sue-Lin Wong (Correspondent at The Economist) \nhttps://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-prince\n\nThese databases and papers were also helpful in gaining a better understanding of Xi Jinping’s alliances and the CCP structure under his terms: \n\nDecoding Chinese Politics interactive by Asia Society Policy Institute \nhttps://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/decoding-chinese-politics\n\nCCP Elite Database by UCSD/Victor Shih\nhttps://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/elites/\n\nChina’s Political System in Charts: A Snapshot Before the 20th Party Congress by Susan V.

And it is not just the US but around the world. People increasingly see themselves as part of opposing teams.\n\nThere are many different reasons for this, but one gets blamed a lot: social media. Social media divides us, makes us more extreme and less empathetic, it riles us up or sucks us into doom scrolling, making us stressed and depressed. It feels like we need to touch grass and escape to the real world. \n\nNew research shows that we might have largely misinterpreted why this is the case. It turns out that the social media internet may uniquely undermine the way our brains work but not in the way you think.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤ https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/47C0nrk\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/46QyCKt\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nrobek, Brad Christensen, Asija Newns, Pedro Castro Verdezoto, Lucas Watkins, damien perolle, Fab Cars, alomanola, MikyF2K, Mithilesh Hinge, okor, Lucan, The Gnome, Kyung Geun Kim, Misa Brass, Martin Hippenstiel, Morgan, Anthony Distel, Filip Rogowski, Gabe, Tobias Hofmann, Zaret, Bootools, David Earl, Ben Hamilton, still [Redacted], polyploidy, Elgenzay, Jared, Soda celeste, Felix, Benjamin Goodrich, Taher Rangwala, Jesse Barnes, WillowTree, DarkKot 686, Aaron Phillips, Luc Royal, Lukas Meier, esamoth, Smithius, Mermor, Laura Kühne, Tyler Fendone, gassi30, Andres Arce, Suzanne frounfelter, Akito Nozaki, SirRender, Space, Daniel Hofmeister, Dan M, Jacob Culp, ReyesX77, Aaron T Haltman, DJ Dubbes, SchnarcheNoah, Keira Standing, Steven Lamontagne, Bliss, David Anderson, Uhh Uhhh Uhhh, The Paul Family"
