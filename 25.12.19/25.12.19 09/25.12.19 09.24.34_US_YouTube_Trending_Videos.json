This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. \nWe are coming close to … Disclosure Day. \n\nUniversal Pictures is proud to release a new original event film created and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars SAG winner and Oscar® nominee Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place), Emmy and Golden Globe winner Josh O’Connor (Challengers, The Crown), Oscar® winner Colin Firth (The King’s Speech, Kingsman franchise), Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, The Perfect Couple) and two-time Oscar® nominee Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin).\n \nBased on a story by Spielberg, the screenplay is by David Koepp, whose previous work with Spielberg includes the scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Combined, those films earned more than $3 billion worldwide. Koepp also wrote the script for this 2025’s Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nDisclosure Day is produced by five-time Academy Award® nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (The Fabelmans, West Side Story) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. \n\nSteven Spielberg is one of the industry’s most successful and influential filmmakers. The top-grossing director of all time, Spielberg has helmed such blockbusters as Jaws, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones franchise and Jurassic Park. \n \nAmong his myriad honors, he is a three-time Academy Award® winner, including Oscars® for Best Director and Best Picture for Schindler’s List, which received a total of seven Oscars®, and for Best Director for Saving Private Ryan. His most recent film, The Fabelmans, was released by Universal in 2022 and received seven Academy Award® nominations, including for Directing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture. \n\nWebsite: http://disclosuredaymovie.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/disclosuredayfilm/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disclosureday/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics?lang=en\nX: https://x.com/disclosureday\nHashtag: #DisclosureDay",

As timelines splinter and the stability of the main MCU begins to erode, Steve is forced back into the conflict, confronting the personal cost of his legacy and the ripple effects of his sacrifice.

                "description": "— Attention Viewers ⚠️\n— This is a Fan-Made Concept Trailer for:\n— Avengers: Doomsday\n\n— Music Credits - https://youtu.be/6Ot-gRruxng\n\n— This video is a fan-made concept trailer, created solely for artistic and entertainment purposes.The goal behind this trailer is to showcase my creativity and storytelling skills through a concept trailer based on a unique and original idea. By combining various effects, sound design, and AI technologies, I’ve crafted a cinematic experience that reimagines familiar worlds in bold and imaginative ways. This trailer is not official and is intended to entertain, inspire, and engage with the YouTube community. Thank you for your support — now let’s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. 🎬✨\n\n— In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story centers on the long-unresolved consequences of Steve Rogers’ final choice in Endgame, revealing that his decision to remain in the past fractured reality in ways the Avengers never anticipated. As timelines splinter and the stability of the main MCU begins to erode, Steve is forced back into the conflict, confronting the personal cost of his legacy and the ripple effects of his sacrifice. The narrative hints at a corrupted alternate reality where familiar heroes took darker paths, drawing Doctor Doom into the heart of the multiversal crisis and threatening total collapse across worlds. With time itself no longer trustworthy, Rogers emerges as both the cause and the possible solution, facing a reckoning that could determine whether the prime timeline survives or is rewritten forever.\n\n—  Subscribe to Teaser Universe 🎬\n—  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#robertdowneyjr #marvel #doomsday"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

I need to prove that I have the skills and work my way up the Minecraft Manhunt ladder.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dream\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound   \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is ONE hunter, but I am NOT allowed to wear any armor. Not a single piece. \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21.10 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\nMusic is from: @dreamproductionsXD \n\n#MinecraftManhunt",

Usually beating maps under an ARK challenge. Unlocking the ending cinematics is easy with no cheats needed anymore, and usually on a server, official or unofficial, I'm not fussed. Single Player is great though, certainly with a guide for any platform be it xbox, ps4, ps5, pc, it's great. Sometimes play some wild mods, and usually post patch/update. But a survival game needs some community news and that's what I do, giving you the latest on events, maps, maybe even premium mods and official usually covering all maps from Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration to Extinction, Gen 1 & Genesis Part 2.  And one day. ARK 2!\n\n#playark #arksurvivalascended #ark2",

            "description": "The Disclosure Day trailer just dropped—and its impact goes far beyond a normal movie teaser. The imagery, symbolism, and messaging feel deliberate, timed, and deeply connected to the broader UFO disclosure narrative unfolding in culture right now. This breakdown focuses on what the trailer signals, why it matters, and how it appears to shape public expectation rather than simply tell a story.\n\nIn this video, we examine how specific scenes in the trailer frame disclosure as inevitable, emotional, and authoritative—using fear, awe, religion, and control themes to guide perception. This is not about personal reaction, but about understanding the psychological and spiritual weight of what’s being presented.\n\nWatch the Disclosure Day trailer for yourself here before or after this breakdown:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVh0KnnGW_s\n\nThis is presented through a biblical discernment lens, connecting Hollywood storytelling, modern disclosure language, and end-times deception warnings without sensationalism or hype.\n\nDon’t forget to get your FREE gift from me at https://www.larryragland.com/free/\n and also leave your prayer request.\n\nTo connect with us, partner with us, or contact us, go to:\nhttps://www.larryragland.com/\n\nRegister now for The Big Picture Prophecy Conference:\nhttps://www.tickettailor.com/events/solidrockchurch/1968105\n\nInterested in traveling with us to Israel?\nEmail info@larryragland.com\n with your name and the number of travelers.\n\nIf this ministry is blessing you and your family, you can give securely online at:\nhttps://www.solidrockchurch.com/give\n\nHashtags:\n#DisclosureDay #UFODisclosure #HollywoodNarratives #UAP #PredictiveProgramming #BibleProphecy #EndTimesDeception #TheBigPicture #Discernment",

The imagery, symbolism, and messaging feel deliberate, timed, and deeply connected to the broader UFO disclosure narrative unfolding in culture right now. This breakdown focuses on what the trailer signals, why it matters, and how it appears to shape public expectation rather than simply tell a story.\n\nIn this video, we examine how specific scenes in the trailer frame disclosure as inevitable, emotional, and authoritative—using fear, awe, religion, and control themes to guide perception. This is not about personal reaction, but about understanding the psychological and spiritual weight of what’s being presented.\n\nWatch the Disclosure Day trailer for yourself here before or after this breakdown:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVh0KnnGW_s\n\nThis is presented through a biblical discernment lens, connecting Hollywood storytelling, modern disclosure language, and end-times deception warnings without sensationalism or hype.\n\nDon’t forget to get your FREE gift from me at https://www.larryragland.com/free/\n and also leave your prayer request.\n\nTo connect with us, partner with us, or contact us, go to:\nhttps://www.larryragland.com/\n\nRegister now for The Big Picture Prophecy Conference:\nhttps://www.tickettailor.com/events/solidrockchurch/1968105\n\nInterested in traveling with us to Israel?\nEmail info@larryragland.com\n with your name and the number of travelers.\n\nIf this ministry is blessing you and your family, you can give securely online at:\nhttps://www.solidrockchurch.com/give\n\nHashtags:\n#DisclosureDay #UFODisclosure #HollywoodNarratives #UAP #PredictiveProgramming #BibleProphecy #EndTimesDeception #TheBigPicture #Discernment"

The entertainment industry’s most competitive reality stars and famous faces play the ultimate murder mystery game. Hosted by award-winning actor Alan Cumming at an ancient castle set deep in the Scottish Highlands, contestants work together on a series of exhilarating missions to build a prize fund worth up to $250,000. Hidden amongst the Faithful are the Traitors, whose goal is to eliminate the Faithful and claim the prize for themselves. Under the cover of darkness, the Traitors murder the Faithful one by one in a treacherous spree, while the Faithful try to uncover the Traitors and banish them from the game. If the Faithful contestants banish all the Traitors, they will share the prize fund, but if a Traitor (or Traitors) makes it to the end, they will steal all the money.\n\n#Peacock #TheTraitorsUS #OfficialTrailer\n\nPeacock is your go-to for hit movies, TV, live sports, and more.

                "title": "I Brought $10,000 to Blackjack and THIS Happened!",
                "description": "We are BACK at the Casino with my first Blackjack session in a very long time! You guys have been asking for it, so let’s fire and win huge? Thank you for watching! I appreciate each and everyone of you supporting me on this journey. Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nJoin my Discord to hang out with me and our community! We also run a bunch of giveaways: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nBrettski stood at the entrance of the casino, the weight of the biggest blackjack session of his life pressing against his chest. The lights were louder than usual, the air thicker, as if the building itself knew what was about to happen. In his jacket pocket sat a stack of cash so thick it bent the fabric—every dollar he’d sworn never to risk in one night. Tonight, he broke that promise.\n\nHe chose a high-limit table tucked away from the noise. Green felt. Fresh deck. A dealer with calm eyes and steady hands. Brettski bought in for an amount that made nearby players stop mid-conversation. The pit boss leaned in closer. Cameras adjusted. This wasn’t just another session.\n\nThe first few hands were a blur. Blackjack. Push. Double down for a clean twenty-one. Brettski rode the wave, stack growing taller with every confident tap of the felt. He smiled, but only slightly—he’d learned long ago that the casino punished arrogance.\n\nThen the cards turned cold.\n\nA dealer six became a twenty-one. His doubles burned. Splits collapsed. In minutes, half the stack vanished. Brettski’s jaw tightened. He stared at the discard tray, replaying every decision. The table felt smaller now. Quieter.\n\nHe stood up, paced once, then sat back down.\n\n“All in,” he said—not on the table, but on the moment.\n\nHe shoved out a bet so massive the dealer paused before dealing. A crowd gathered. The pit boss picked up the phone. Brettski received a hard sixteen against a dealer ten—the hand every gambler hates. He didn’t hesitate.\n\n“Hit.”\n\nThe card slid out slowly.\n\nIt was a five.\n\nThe dealer flipped—sixteen.\n\nPulled a card.\n\nAn ace.\n\nThe table gasped.\n\nThe dealer reached for the next card, hovering for just a split second longer than usual… and Brettski realized something was very wrong as the pit boss suddenly stepped forward and said—\n\n“Hold the game.”\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Of ik nu een goede of een slechte reeks heb, elke draai vertelt een verhaal.\n\nAls je van authentieke casino-actie met hoge inzetten houdt, klik dan op de abonneerknop en ga met me mee op de ultieme gokreis.\n….\n👀 Wil je meer waanzinnige jackpots en de hoogste inzetten op gokkasten zien? --- DIT MOET JE KIJKEN - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLse60e6EjWxVJLPJSC7aPgmvVyPRZOyQ0\n.....\nWord lid van het NG SLOT-kanaal: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOzRZLOxGmDMGo_zSBtpmqA/join\n.............\n#SlotMachines #Jackpot #games #casino\nHet doel van dit kanaal is niet om te adverteren of gokken te promoten.
