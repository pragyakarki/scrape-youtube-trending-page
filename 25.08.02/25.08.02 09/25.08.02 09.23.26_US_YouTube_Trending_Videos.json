ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

(Eh, eh, eh)\n\n[Verso 4]\nQué bonito chingarte y más rico y de noche\nUn palito en el aire y privado pa' Londres\nDiferentes mujeres de varios sabores\nNomás no te me aloques\nMujeriego y coqueto, tengo mil amores\nDe hace tiempo te busco, mas no sé ni en dónde\nSi me quieres, tendrás que aguantar los rumores\nNomás no te me aloques\n\n[Outro]\nEy\nFuerza Regida\nJajaja\n¿Ah?\nJaja\n\n#FuerzaRegida #TuSancho"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

                "description": "हम कैसीनो में वापस आ गए हैं और दुनिया की सबसे लोकप्रिय स्लॉट मशीनों का परीक्षण कर रहे हैं... बनाम सबसे कम लोकप्रिय स्लॉट मशीनों का। हम देखेंगे कि सबसे अच्छी स्लॉट मशीनों के बारे में इतना शोर क्यों मचा है, और सबसे खराब स्लॉट मशीनों में क्या बुराई है। लाइक करने, सब्सक्राइब करने और कमेंट्स में अपने विचार लिखने के लिए आप सभी का बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद। भले ही आप मुझे चिढ़ा रहे हों—मैं फिर भी आपसे प्यार करता हूँ। आप सभी खूबसूरत हैं, और इस रोमांचक सफ़र में साथ चलने के लिए मैं आप सभी का तहे दिल से शुक्रिया अदा करता हूँ। मुझे शुभकामनाएँ दें, और मैं आपसे अगली बार मिलूँगा! चलो जंग शुरू करते हैं।\n\nब्रेट्स्की मुस्कुराते हुए और एक योजना के साथ नीयन रोशनी वाले कैसीनो में टहलता हुआ आया। जुआरियों के बीच एक स्थानीय किंवदंती, वह एक सिद्धांत साबित करने आया था: सबसे लोकप्रिय और सबसे कम लोकप्रिय स्लॉट मशीनों में रहस्य छिपे होते हैं—और वह उन्हें तोड़ने वाला था।\n\nपहला पड़ाव: \"जैकपॉट इन्फर्नो\", कैसीनो का प्रिय, भीड़ से घिरा हुआ मानो कंफ़ेद्दी बाँट रहा हो। उसने अंदर सरकाया, एक तीखा सौ डॉलर डाला, और स्पिन बटन दबाया। घंटियाँ बजी - पहली ही खींच में 300 डॉलर। आँखें घूम गईं। उसने आँख मारी। लेकिन अगले एक घंटे में, मशीन ठंडी पड़ गई। सचमुच ठंडी। उसका ढेर कम होता गया, और भीड़ सिगरेट के धुएँ की तरह छँट गई।\n\n\"अपने बदसूरत चचेरे भाई से मिलने का समय हो गया है,\" ब्रेट्स्की बुदबुदाया।\n\nचौकीदार की कोठरी के पास एक धूल भरे कोने में \"लकी क्लाउन बोनान्ज़ा\" रखा था, अछूता और बेपनाह। वह ऐसे टिमटिमा रहा था जैसे उसे बुखार हो। एकदम सही।\n\nपहला स्पिन? कुछ नहीं। दूसरा? फिर भी कुछ नहीं। तीसरा? *बोनस राउंड।*\n\nस्क्रीन में गड़बड़ी हुई। फिर कैसीनो में रोशनी धीमी हो गई। तीन धड़कनों के लिए, सब कुछ काला हो गया। जब बिजली वापस आई, तो ब्रेट्स्की की मशीन एक जैकपॉट के साथ चमक उठी: 15 लाख डॉलर। लेकिन मशीन ने टिकट नहीं छापा। इसके बजाय, स्क्रीन के नीचे एक दराज चरमराती हुई खुली और एक घिसा हुआ लिफ़ाफ़ा निकला जिस पर लिखा था: *“आपको मिल गया।”*\n\nअंदर एक चाबी थी। और निर्देशांक।\n\nउसने उसे पिट बॉस को दिखाया—लेकिन उस आदमी का चेहरा पीला पड़ गया। “तुम्हें यह कहाँ से मिला?”\n\n“मशीन ने मुझे दिया।”\n\n“वहाँ कोई मशीन नहीं है,” उसने कहा।\n\nब्रेट्स्की मुड़ा। क्लाउन मशीन गायब हो गई थी।\n\nसुरक्षाकर्मी उमड़ पड़े। कैमरे बंद हो गए थे। कोई निशान नहीं। कोई जैकपॉट नहीं। कोई लिफ़ाफ़ा नहीं। सिवाय चाबी के... अभी भी ब्रेट्स्की के हाथ में।\n\nघर वापस आकर, उसने अपने लैपटॉप में निर्देशांक टाइप किए। नेवादा रेगिस्तान में एक जगह। और चाबी के कोने में एक शब्द खुदा हुआ था:\n\n**तिजोरी।**\n\nब्रेट्स्की ने एक डफ़ल बैग पैक किया।\n\nअगली सुबह, कैसीनो ने एक बयान जारी किया:\n\n**“ब्रेट्स्की लापता है।”**\n\n#स्लॉट्स #ब्लैकजैक #जुआ #कैसीनो #बैकारेट #रूलेट\n\nब्रेट्स्की कौन है? ब्रेट्स्की एक पेशेवर जुआरी है, जो वेगास मैट, ब्लफ़, डेगेनडाल्ट, मिस्टर हैंड पे या लेडी लक मुख्यालय जैसे प्राचीन दिग्गजों की तरह है! हालाँकि, इन दिग्गजों के विपरीत, ब्रेट्स्की के पास हज़ारों सालों का प्राचीन ज्ञान है जो बुजुर्गों ने इकट्ठा किया था, जिसमें स्लॉट मशीन, रूलेट, ब्लैकजैक, क्रेप्स, बबल क्रेप्स, पोकर और बैकारेट जैसे कौशल शामिल हैं। एक पेशेवर जुआरी के रूप में ब्रेट्स्की का लक्ष्य सरल है: जुए से कमाए गए धन का उपयोग करके पूरे लास वेगास पर कब्ज़ा करना। विश्व प्रभुत्व में उनके सफ़र का समर्थन करने के लिए सदस्यता लें।"

                "description": "Estamos de VOLTA ao cassino testando as máquinas caça-níqueis MAIS POPULARES do mundo... versus as MENOS populares. Vamos ver o que há de tão badalado nas melhores e o que há de tão ruim nas piores. Muito obrigada a todos por curtirem, se inscreverem e deixarem suas opiniões nos comentários. Mesmo que estejam me provocando, eu ainda amo vocês. Vocês são todos lindos, e eu realmente aprecio cada um de vocês por embarcarem nessa jornada maluca. Desejem-me sorte e nos vemos na próxima! Vamos à guerra.\n\nBrettski entrou no cassino iluminado por neon com um sorriso e um plano. Uma lenda local entre os apostadores, ele estava lá para provar uma teoria: as máquinas caça-níqueis mais populares e menos populares guardavam segredos — e ele iria decifrá-los.\n\nPrimeira parada: \"Jackpot Inferno\", o queridinho do cassino, cercado por uma multidão como se estivesse distribuindo confete. Ele entrou, inseriu uma nota de cem e apertou o botão de girar. O sinal tocou — 300 dólares na primeira rodada. Olhos se voltaram. Ele piscou. Mas, na hora seguinte, a máquina esfriou. Gelada de verdade. Sua pilha de fichas diminuiu e a multidão se dispersou como fumaça de cigarro.\n\n\"Hora de conhecer seu primo feio\", murmurou Brettski.\n\nEscondido em um canto empoeirado perto do armário do zelador, estava \"Lucky Clown Bonanza\", intocado e desprezado. Ele tremeluzia como se estivesse com febre. Perfeito.\n\nA primeira rodada? Nada. Segunda? Ainda nada. Terceira? *Rodada bônus.*\n\nA tela piscou. Então as luzes do cassino diminuíram. Por três segundos, tudo ficou preto. Quando a energia voltou, a máquina de Brettski piscou com um prêmio acumulado: 1,5 milhão de dólares. Mas a máquina não imprimiu nenhum bilhete. Em vez disso, uma gaveta abaixo da tela se abriu com um rangido, revelando um envelope gasto com a inscrição: *\"Você encontrou.\"*\n\nDentro havia uma chave. E as coordenadas.\n\nEle mostrou ao chefe do cassino — mas o rosto do homem empalideceu. \"Onde você conseguiu isso?\"\n\n\"A máquina me deu.\"\n\n\"Não *há* nenhuma máquina ali\", disse ele.\n\nBrettski se virou. A máquina de palhaço havia sumido.\n\nA segurança estava a mil. As câmeras estavam apagadas. Nenhum vestígio. Nenhum prêmio acumulado. Nenhum envelope. Exceto a chave... ainda na mão de Brettski.\n\nDe volta a casa, ele digitou as coordenadas em seu laptop. Um local no deserto de Nevada. E uma palavra gravada no canto da chave:\n\n**Cofre.**\n\nBrettski preparou uma mochila.\n\nNa manhã seguinte, o cassino divulgou um comunicado:\n\n**\"Brettski está desaparecido.\"**\n\n#caça-níqueis #blackjack #jogos de azar #cassino #bacará #roleta\n\nQuem é Brettski? Brettski é um jogador profissional, semelhante às lendas antigas Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay ou Lady Luck HQ!

                "description": "Siamo TORNATI al casinò per testare le slot machine più POPOLARI del mondo... e quelle MENO popolari. Vedremo perché si parla tanto delle migliori e cosa c'è di così negativo nelle peggiori. Grazie mille a tutti per aver messo \"Mi piace\", per esservi iscritti e per aver lasciato i vostri pensieri nei commenti. Anche se mi state prendendo in giro, vi amo comunque. Siete tutti bellissimi e apprezzo davvero ognuno di voi per avermi accompagnato in questo folle viaggio. Auguratemi buona fortuna e ci vediamo alla prossima! Andiamo in guerra.\n\nBrettski entrò nel casinò illuminato al neon con un sorriso e un piano. Una leggenda locale tra i giocatori d'azzardo, era lì per dimostrare una teoria: le slot machine più popolari e meno popolari nascondevano segreti e lui li avrebbe svelati.\n\nPrima tappa: \"Jackpot Inferno\", la beniamina del casinò, circondata da una folla che sembrava distribuire coriandoli. Entrò, inserì una banconota da cento e premette il tasto \"gira\". Suonò la campanella: 300 dollari alla prima estrazione. Gli occhi si girarono. Fece l'occhiolino. Ma nell'ora successiva, la macchinetta si raffreddò. Davvero fredda. Il suo stack diminuì e la folla si disperse come fumo di sigaretta.\n\n\"È ora di conoscere il tuo cugino brutto\", borbottò Brettski.\n\nNascosto in un angolo polveroso vicino all'armadio del custode, c'era \"Lucky Clown Bonanza\", intatto e trascurato. Tremolava come se avesse la febbre. Perfetto.\n\nIl primo giro? Niente. Il secondo? Ancora niente. Il terzo? *Giro bonus.*\n\nLo schermo si bloccò. Poi le luci del casinò si abbassarono. Per tre secondi, tutto divenne nero. Quando tornò la corrente, la macchinetta di Brettski lampeggiò con un jackpot: 1,5 milioni di dollari. Ma la macchinetta non stampò alcun biglietto. Invece, un cassetto sotto lo schermo si aprì scricchiolando, rivelando una busta consumata con la scritta: *\"L'hai trovato.\"*\n\nDentro c'era una chiave. E delle coordinate.\n\nLa mostrò al responsabile del box, ma l'uomo impallidì. \"Dove l'hai presa?\"\n\n\"Me l'ha data la macchina.\"\n\n\"Non *c'è* nessuna macchina laggiù\", disse.\n\nBrettski si voltò. La macchina-clown era sparita.\n\nLa sicurezza si riversò. Le telecamere erano state oscurate. Nessuna traccia. Nessun jackpot. Nessuna busta. Tranne la chiave... ancora in mano a Brettski.\n\nTornato a casa, digitò le coordinate sul suo portatile. Un luogo nel deserto del Nevada. E una parola incisa nell'angolo della chiave:\n\n**Caveau.**\n\nBrettski preparò un borsone.\n\nLa mattina dopo, il casinò ha rilasciato una dichiarazione:\n\n**\"Brettski è scomparso.\"**\n\n#slot #blackjack #gioco d'azzardo #casinò #baccarat #roulette\n\nChi è Brettski?

Dia masuk, memasukkan seratus yang tajam, dan menekan tombol putar. Bel berbunyi — 300 dolar pada tarikan pertama. Mata berputar. Dia mengedipkan mata.

Wsunął się, wrzucił świeżą setkę i nacisnął spin. Zadzwoniły dzwonki – 300 dolarów za pierwszym pociągnięciem. Oczy się odwróciły. Puścił oko. Ale w ciągu następnej godziny maszyna ostygła.

Auch wenn ihr mich aufzieht – ich liebe euch trotzdem. Ihr seid alle wunderbar, und ich bin jedem einzelnen von euch wirklich dankbar, dass ihr diese verrückte Reise mitgemacht habt. Wünscht mir Glück, wir sehen uns beim nächsten Mal! Auf in den Krieg!\n\nBrettski schlenderte mit einem Grinsen und einem Plan in das neonbeleuchtete Casino. Er war eine lokale Legende unter Spielern und wollte eine Theorie beweisen: Die beliebtesten und die unbeliebtesten Spielautomaten bergen Geheimnisse – und er würde sie lüften.\n\nErster Halt: „Jackpot Inferno“, der Liebling des Casinos, umringt von einer Menge, als würde er Konfetti ausschütten. Er schlüpfte hinein, warf einen frischen Hunderter ein und drückte auf „Drehen“. Die Glocken läuteten – 300 $ beim ersten Zug. Die Augen drehten sich. Er zwinkerte. Doch in der nächsten Stunde wurde der Automat kalt. Richtig kalt. Sein Stapel schrumpfte, und die Menge zerstreute sich wie Zigarettenrauch.\n\n„Zeit, deinen hässlichen Cousin kennenzulernen“, murmelte Brettski.\n\nIn einer staubigen Ecke neben der Hausmeisterabstellkammer stand „Lucky Clown Bonanza“, unberührt und ungeliebt. Er flackerte, als hätte er Fieber. Perfekt.\n\nDer erste Dreh? Nichts. Der zweite? Immer noch nichts. Der dritte? *Bonusrunde.*\n\nDer Bildschirm flackerte. Dann wurden die Lichter im Casino gedimmt. Für drei Herzschläge wurde alles schwarz. Als der Strom wieder da war, blinkte Brettskis Automat mit einem Jackpot: 1,5 Millionen $. Aber der Automat druckte kein Ticket. Stattdessen öffnete sich quietschend eine Schublade unter dem Bildschirm und gab einen abgenutzten Umschlag frei, auf dem stand: *„Du hast es gefunden.“*\n\nDarin befand sich ein Schlüssel. Und die Koordinaten. Er zeigte es dem Pit Boss – doch der Mann erbleichte. „Wo haben Sie das her?“\n\n„Der Automat hat es mir gegeben.“\n\n„Da drüben *ist* kein Automat“, sagte er.\n\nBrettski drehte sich um. Der Clown-Automat war verschwunden.\n\nDie Sicherheitsleute waren umringt. Die Kameras waren ausgefallen. Keine Spur. Kein Jackpot. Kein Umschlag. Außer dem Schlüssel … noch immer in Brettskis Hand.\n\nZuhause tippte er die Koordinaten in seinen Laptop. Ein Ort in der Wüste Nevadas. Und ein Wort, das in die Ecke des Schlüssels eingraviert war:\n\n**Tresorraum.**\n\nBrettski packte eine Reisetasche.\n\nAm nächsten Morgen veröffentlichte das Casino eine Erklärung:\n\n**„Brettski wird vermisst.“**\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski? Brettski ist ein professioneller Spieler, ähnlich wie die alten Legenden Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay oder Lady Luck HQ! Im Gegensatz zu diesen Legenden verfügt Brettski jedoch über jahrtausendealtes Wissen, das von den Ältesten gesammelt wurde und sich auf Spielautomaten, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker und Baccarat spezialisiert hat.

                "description": "再びカジノに戻り、世界で最も人気のあるスロットマシンと、最も人気のないスロットマシンを比較検証します。最高のスロットマシンがなぜこれほど話題になっているのか、そして最悪のスロットマシンの何がそんなに悪いのかを検証します。「いいね！」やチャンネル登録、そしてコメント欄へのご意見をお寄せくださった皆様、本当にありがとうございます。たとえ私を批判したとしても、私は皆さんのことが大好きです。皆さんは皆素晴らしいです。このクレイジーな旅に付き合ってくれた一人一人に心から感謝しています。幸運を祈ってください。次回もお会いしましょう！さあ、戦いましょう。\n\nブレツキーは、ネオンに照らされたカジノに、にっこりと笑みを浮かべて、ある計画を掲げて足を踏み入れました。地元のギャンブラーの間では伝説的な存在である彼は、ある仮説を証明するためにここに来ました。最も人気のあるスロットマシンと、最も人気のないスロットマシンには秘密が隠されているという仮説です。そして、彼はその秘密を解き明かそうとしていたのです。\n\n最初の目的地は、カジノの人気マシン「ジャックポット・インフェルノ」。まるで紙吹雪を撒き散らすかのように、大勢の観客に囲まれていました。彼はカードを入れ、100ドル札を投入し、スピンを回した。ベルが鳴った――最初の引きで300ドルが出た。視線が向けられた。彼はウインクした。しかし、それから1時間も経たないうちに、マシンは冷たくなった。本当に冷たくなった。彼のスタックは減り、群衆はタバコの煙のように散っていった。\n\n「醜い従兄弟に会う時間だ」とブレツキーは呟いた。\n\n用務員室のクローゼットの埃っぽい片隅に、「ラッキー・クラウン・ボナンザ」は、誰も触れられることなく、誰も愛さないまま、置いてあった。熱病でも患っているかのようにチラチラと点滅していた。完璧だった。\n\n最初のスピン？何もなかった。2回目？それでも何もなかった。3回目？*ボーナスラウンド*\n\n画面に不具合が発生した。そしてカジノ全体の照明が暗くなった。3拍の間、すべてが真っ暗になった。電源が復旧すると、ブレツキーのマシンはジャックポット150万ドルの点滅を発した。しかし、マシンはチケットを印刷しなかった。代わりに、スクリーンの下の引き出しがきしむ音を立てて開き、古びた封筒が現れた。封筒には「見つけたぞ」と書かれていた。\n\n中には鍵と、座標が記されていた。\n\n彼はそれをピットボスに見せたが、ボスの顔は青ざめた。「どこで手に入れたんだ？」\n\n「機械がくれたんだ。」\n\n「あそこに機械は*ない*」と彼は言った。\n\nブレツキーは振り返った。ピエロの機械は消えていた。\n\n警備員が群がっていた。カメラはブラックアウトしていた。痕跡は何もなかった。ジャックポットも、封筒も。鍵だけが…ブレツキーの手の中に残っていた。\n\n家に戻った彼は、ノートパソコンに座標を入力した。ネバダ砂漠のある場所。そして、鍵の隅に刻まれた言葉は一つ。\n\n**Vault**\n\nブレツキーはダッフルバッグに荷物を詰めた。\n\n翌朝、カジノは声明を発表しました。\n\n**「ブレツキーは行方不明です。」**\n\n#スロット #ブラックジャック #ギャンブル #カジノ #バカラ #ルーレット\n\nブレツキーとは誰？ ブレツキーはプロのギャンブラーで、ベガス・マット、ブラフ、デゲン・ダルト、ミスター・ハンド・ペイ、レディ・ラックHQといった伝説の人物と肩を並べる存在です。しかし、これらの伝説の人物とは異なり、ブレツキーはスロットマシン、ルーレット、ブラックジャック、クラップス、バブルクラップス、ポーカー、バカラといったスキルにおいて、長老たちから受け継いだ数千年にわたる古代の知識を蓄積しています。プロギャンブラーとしてのブレツキーの目標はシンプルです。ギャンブルで稼いだ資金を使って、ラスベガスを制覇することです。世界制覇を目指す彼の旅を応援するために、チャンネル登録をお願いします。"

                "description": "We zijn TERUG in het casino om de populairste gokkasten ter wereld te testen... vergeleken met de minst populaire gokkasten. We gaan kijken waar al die hype om draait bij de beste, en wat er zo slecht is aan de slechtste. Heel erg bedankt allemaal voor het liken, abonneren en het achterlaten van jullie mening in de reacties. Zelfs als jullie me belachelijk maken, hou ik nog steeds van jullie. Jullie zijn allemaal prachtig, en ik waardeer het enorm dat jullie allemaal mee hebben gedaan aan deze gekke reis. Wens me succes, en ik zie jullie bij de volgende! Laten we ten strijde trekken.\n\nBrettski liep het neonverlichte casino binnen met een grijns en een plan. Een lokale legende onder gokkers, hij was hier om een theorie te bewijzen: de populairste en minst populaire gokkasten hadden geheimen – en hij ging ze kraken.\n\nEerste stop: \"Jackpot Inferno\", de lieveling van het casino, omringd door een menigte alsof er confetti werd uitgekeerd. Hij schoof erin, gooide een kraakheldere honderd in de automaat en drukte op spin. Bellen rinkelden — $300 bij de eerste trek. Ogen draaiden. Hij knipoogde. Maar in de loop van het volgende uur werd de machine koud. Echt koud. Zijn stack slonk en de menigte verspreidde zich als sigarettenrook.\n\n\"Tijd om je lelijke neef te ontmoeten,\" mompelde Brettski.\n\nVerstopt in een stoffige hoek bij de kast van de conciërge stond \"Lucky Clown Bonanza\", onaangeroerd en ongeliefd. Het flikkerde alsof het koorts had. Perfect.\n\nDe eerste draai? Niets. De tweede? Nog steeds niets. De derde? *Bonusronde.*\n\nHet scherm haperde. Toen dimden de lichten in het casino. Drie hartslagen lang werd alles zwart. Toen de stroom terugkwam, knipperde Brettski's machine met een jackpot: $1,5 miljoen. Maar de machine printte geen lot. In plaats daarvan ging een lade onder het scherm krakend open en onthulde een versleten envelop met het opschrift: *\"Je hebt het gevonden.\"*\n\nEr zat een sleutel in. En coördinaten.\n\nHij liet het aan de pit boss zien, maar het gezicht van de man werd bleek. \"Waar heb je dit vandaan?\"\n\n\"De machine gaf het me.\"\n\n\"Er *is* daar geen machine,\" zei hij.\n\nBrettski draaide zich om. De clownmachine was weg.\n\nDe beveiliging zwermde toe. Camera's waren zwart geworden. Geen spoor. Geen jackpot. Geen envelop. Behalve de sleutel... nog steeds in Brettski's hand.\n\nThuis typte hij de coördinaten in op zijn laptop. Een locatie in de woestijn van Nevada. En één woord gekerfd in de hoek van de sleutel:\n\n**Kluis.**\n\nBrettski pakte een sporttas.\n\nDe volgende ochtend gaf het casino een verklaring af:\n\n**\"Brettski is vermist.\"**\n\n#slots #blackjack #gokken #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWie is Brettski? Brettski is een professionele gokker, vergelijkbaar met de oude legendes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay of Lady Luck HQ! In tegenstelling tot deze legendes beschikt Brettski echter over duizenden jaren aan opgeslagen, oude kennis, verzameld door de ouderen, over vaardigheden zoals gokautomaten, roulette, blackjack, craps, bubble craps, poker en baccarat. Brettski's doel als professionele gokker is simpel: heel Las Vegas veroveren met geld dat hij verdient met gokken. Abonneer je om zijn reis naar wereldheerschappij te steunen."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop — where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything in this infinite playground is designed and constructed by individual members of the ROBLOX community. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything desired — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up object or activity. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanism",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop — where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything in this infinite playground is designed and constructed by individual members of the ROBLOX community. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything desired — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up object or activity. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanism"
