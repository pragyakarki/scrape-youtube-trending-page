ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Harrison Ford powraca jako kultowy archeolog, starszy, ale wciąż nie gorszy od reszty, stając przed ostateczną misją, która może zmienić bieg historii.\n\nKiedy na powierzchnię wypływa potężny relikt – powiązany z zapomnianą cywilizacją i tajną globalną wojną – dr Jones musi połączyć siły z błyskotliwą i nieustraszoną historyczką, graną przez Angelinę Jolie. Razem ścigają się z mrocznymi siłami, odkrywając skrywane sekrety i walcząc z wrogami, którzy nie cofną się przed niczym, by zdobyć artefakt.\n\nTen odświeżony rozdział, osadzony w egzotycznych lokacjach, epickich pościgach i starożytnych zagadkach, zgłębia dziedzictwo, poświęcenie i cenę za wiedzę o zbyt wielu rzeczach.\n\nZastrzeżenie:\nTo fanowski zwiastun koncepcyjny, stworzony wyłącznie w celach rozrywkowych.

(Eh, eh, eh)\n\n[Verso 4]\nQué bonito chingarte y más rico y de noche\nUn palito en el aire y privado pa' Londres\nDiferentes mujeres de varios sabores\nNomás no te me aloques\nMujeriego y coqueto, tengo mil amores\nDe hace tiempo te busco, mas no sé ni en dónde\nSi me quieres, tendrás que aguantar los rumores\nNomás no te me aloques\n\n[Outro]\nEy\nFuerza Regida\nJajaja\n¿Ah?\nJaja\n\n#FuerzaRegida #TuSancho",

(Eh, eh, eh)\n\n[Verso 4]\nQué bonito chingarte y más rico y de noche\nUn palito en el aire y privado pa' Londres\nDiferentes mujeres de varios sabores\nNomás no te me aloques\nMujeriego y coqueto, tengo mil amores\nDe hace tiempo te busco, mas no sé ni en dónde\nSi me quieres, tendrás que aguantar los rumores\nNomás no te me aloques\n\n[Outro]\nEy\nFuerza Regida\nJajaja\n¿Ah?\nJaja\n\n#FuerzaRegida #TuSancho"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."

Players are thrown into a tiny world with almost no rules, except survive as long as possible.\n\nIn Past Life, we will be playing through the older versions of Minecraft and updating to a newer one each episode.\n\n3+ Lives = Green Player\n2 Lives = Yellow Player\n1 Life = Red Player\n\nRed Players are given the goal of killing all the other players in the game. Yellow Players can kill Green Players.\n\nGrian: https://www.youtube.com/@Grian\nSmallishbeans: https://www.youtube.com/@SmallishBeans\nSmajor1995: https://www.youtube.com/@Dangthatsalongname\nbigbst4tz2: https://www.youtube.com/@Bigbst4tz22\nEtho: https://www.youtube.com/@EthosLab\nBdoubleO100: https://www.youtube.com/@bdoubleo\nPearlescentMoon: https://youtube.com/@PearlescentMoon\nInTheLittleWood: https://www.youtube.com/@martyn\nGeminitay: https://www.youtube.com/@GeminiTayMC\nGoodTimeWithScar: https://www.youtube.com/@GoodTimesWithScar\nimpulseSV: https://www.youtube.com/@impulseSV\nTango: https://www.youtube.com/@TangoTekLP\nZombieCleo: https://www.youtube.com/@ZombieCleo\nRendog: https://www.youtube.com/@rendog\nSolidarityGaming: https://www.youtube.com/@SolidarityGaming\nSkizzleman: https://www.youtube.com/@MCSkizzleman \n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/EthoLP\nTwitchTV: http://www.twitch.tv/ethotv/\n\n#pastlife #etho #minecraft"
