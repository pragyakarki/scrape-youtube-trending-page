Follow our Indiegogo Pre-Launch Page: [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/spider-man-alone-episode-1/coming_soon/]\n\nHappy National Spider-Man Day! From Golden Century Films and our \"Marvel Inspire\" universe, this is the official teaser trailer for 'Spider-Man: Alone.'\n\nSeason 1 of 'Spider-Man: Alone' is a deeply personal, character-driven fan series that plunges into the heart of Peter Parker's earliest days. A modern, street-level reimagining of Amazing Fantasy #15, our story explores the profound isolation and immense weight of newfound powers. This is the story of a boy learning to fly, and the agonizing, often lonely, process of what it cost him to become a hero.\n\nThis project is also proud to launch our Inspired Action initiative in partnership with the non-profit Friendly Neighborhood Activist, aiming to turn on-screen heroism into real-world change.\n\nFollow the Journey & Join Our Community:\n► Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/goldencenturyfilms/]\n► Twitter/X: [https://x.com/GoldenCenturyTV?t=nvrx03KCKC60Z4TcAYX5KA&s=09]\n► Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/share/1GUwgCDW4o/]\n\nAbout This Project:\n\n'Spider-Man: Alone' is a non-profit fan series. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Marvel, Sony, or any of their subsidiaries.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

This is our first new release of 2025 and the first song I've ever released under complete prolonged clarity. This year will have my best and most impactful work. I am putting everything into creating pieces we can all be proud of. This is music for the PEOPLE, spread BY THE PEOPLE.

Love y'all...Thank you.\n\nClick here to listen:  https://dax.lnk.to/TheManIUsedToBe\n\n\nFollow DAX: @ thatsdax\nShot by: Logan Meis\nProduced by: Jimmy Robbins\n\n\n#ManIUsedToBe #Dax #recovery #masculinity #addiction #sober #manhood\n\n\nLYRICS:\n\nI’m half the man I used to be \nIt’s gon’ take some getting used to me\nI used to think I had it all\nBut when you’re up all you do is fall\nAnd that’s why I’m\nHalf the man I used to be\n\nTrials and tribulations \nAll my past trauma\nGenerational curses from daddy and mama\nHeartbreak and lies\nDirty soul ties \nMixed with addictions that clouded my eyes\nI’ve been mistaken and taken for granted\nand locked in the prison that I call my mind\nAnd now that I’ve lived and I’ve learned  \nAnd I’ve built and I’ve burned all these bridges I’ll leave it behind\nAnd that’s why\n\nI’m half the man I used to be \nIt’s gon’ take some getting used to me\nI used to think I had it all\nBut when you’re up all you do is fall\nAnd that’s why I’m\nHalf the man I used to be\n\nDon’t ask the reason I changed\nAsk yourself why you stayed the same \nI couldn’t sleep in that bed I made\nI needed more in life \nI tried every remedy prescribed \nGetting drunk every night \nLetting women waste my time \nNow I’m in a phase I can sleep alone \nI don’t ever chase, I got God\nLetting go of pain that was never mine\nTrying to bear the weights \nnot my job \nCause that’s the man i used to be\nAnd he ain't no use to me\n\nI’m half the man I used to be \nIt’s gon’ take some getting used to me\nI used to think I had it all\nBut when you’re up all you do is fall\nAnd that’s why I’m\nHalf the man I used to be\n\nI’m half the man I used to be \nIt’s gon’ take some getting used to me\nI used to think I had it all\nBut when you’re up all you do is fall\nAnd that’s why I’m\nHalf the man I used to be\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nIf you made it this deep you're a real one. Thank you for continuing to allow me to use my platform to make an impact. Your support is appreciated more than you'll ever know and I will continue to prove that with my actions. I'm very excited. This is our first new release of 2025 and the first song I've ever released under complete prolonged clarity. This year will have my best and most impactful work. I am putting everything into creating pieces we can all be proud of. This is music for the PEOPLE, spread BY THE PEOPLE. Like, comment, SHARE and let's continue to be the change we wish to see in the world.\n\nOfficial Video for “Man I Used To Be\" by Dax"

                "description": "We found a secret when we went to dig the backyard!\n\nIn this video, the Kin Tin Krew plays Dig The Backyard in Roblox! Kin Tin, Kyle, and Roro are called to help dig in the backyard of an old woman's house to find a secret item buried deep int he ground. They don't know what the item is exactly their looking for, but it's very valuable! Digging the backyard won't be easy! They'll have to gather items they dig up to sell and slowly upgrade their shovels, backpacks, and energy with the money they earn. The better their upgrades, the faster they can dig! But that's not the only thing they'll have to worry about. They'll have to avoid giant worms, groups of zombies, suspicious neighbors and.....pigeons?! Why are these pigeons staring at everyone?! Time is running out and they need to find the secret buried treasure fast! Will the Kin Tin Krew be able to Dig The Backyard fast enough or will the GIANT worm find them first?! Let's go!    \n\nPlay This Game: https://www.roblox.com/games/83704201064817/Dig-the-Backyard-Alpha\n\n👑 Become an ULTIMATE Kin Tin Krew Member!:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQEjUMa3F-Em5o_JLx4PFqg/join\n⭐ KIN TIN MERCH HERE: https://bit.ly/3Mm7Wsi\n\n✅Subscribe To Kin Tin Plays https://bit.ly/3hOVkuD \n✅Subscribe To Our Main Channel Kin Tin https://bit.ly/2SUaUNd\n\n❤Thanks so much for being a part of the Kin Tin Krew!❤\n#roblox #gaming #obby"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",
