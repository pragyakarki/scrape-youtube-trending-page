                "description": "HELLO FRIENDS!! And welcome to another video… as you guys know, I am a serial online shopper. And a little while ago, I started noticing a LOT of QVC-esque shopping livestreams on my TikTok for you page…. Wigs, crystal scoops, and athleisure galore!! So I decided to investigate to see what it was actually like to participate in these shopping livestreams, if the products they were selling are any good, and also maybe try and figure out why there are so many damn shopping livestreams seemingly everywhere nowadays. What do you guys think?

Just clamp down a straight board to use as a guide.\nAfter dry fitting the plywood, I could see there was a bulge on the side wall keeping the shelf from sliding all the way back.\nSo, I use my pencil like a scribe, now I can cut the plywood to fit the wall.\nI apply liquid nails to the frame and set the shelf down- fits like a glove.\nNext, I load 1 ¾” trim nails into my 15-gauge trim gun to shoot it down.\nI measure with a tape- making sure to hit the frame.\nWhen I cut the face board, I use a 2-degree bevel, this way it’s a little longer in the front than the back and makes it fit super snug (you can see here what a good fit I got).\nDon’t worry -The nail holes get filled before it’s painted.\nAt this point I was so tired I decided to take a nap.\nAnd then, the New Guy actually came out of his office to paint it for me.\nBe sure to like and follow (subscribe) for more content like this. @hausplans\n\n#build #howto #carpentry #framing #construction #diy #contractor #tools",

The Vanquish has seen several other changes over its previous iteration, including a new chassis with a longer wheelbase and a higher top speed of 344 kph (214 mph). But does it provide the driving experience you might expect of a full-fledged Aston Martin halo car? And with only a few choices for a new V12 on the market, how does it compare to its similarly-engined competitors? Thomas and James are excited to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

            "description": "Undefeated IBF Super Welterweight World Champion Bakhram Murtazaliev dropped former world champion Tim Tszyu four times on his way to a third-round stoppage in the main event of PBC Championship Boxing on Prime Video action Saturday night from the Caribe Royale Resort in Orlando, Florida.\n \nAfter winning the title in his opponent’s home territory of Germany earlier this year, Murtazaliev (23-0, 17 KOs) made a statement by dropping Tszyu (24-2, 17 KOs) early and often on his way to the dominant stoppage.\n \nThe first knockdown came in round two with a strong counter left hook sending Tszyu to the canvas. Tszyu showed the incredible grit that’s made him a superstar in his native Australia to rise to his feet, but was ultimately sent back to the ground two more times in the round.\n \n\"We just worked on these combinations all the time and when the fight came, it was automatic,” said Murtazaliev. “We worked for 10 weeks on those punches that hurt him. We created opportunities and we believed that we could win this fight.”\n \nContinuing to press forward and look for moments in round three, Murtazaliev landed another vicious counter left hand that scored him his fourth knockdown in less than three rounds. While Tszyu continued to battle back, the onslaught from Murtazaliev proved to be too much as Tszyu’s corner threw in the towel, ending the fight 1:55 into the round.\n \n\"When I landed that first big shot, I knew how hard it was,” said Murtazaliev. “Tszyu is a real warrior and I hope one day we can work together and spar and help each other to grow.\"\n \n\"Every time I step into the ring I leave it all in there,” said Tszyu. “Things didn't go to plan and the better man won tonight. No excuses. After the first shot, things started not going according to plan. That's part of boxing, you get hit and reactions get slower. Bakhram is the man at 154.\"\n\n#MurtazalievTszyu #TimTszyu #Murtazaliev \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

            "title": "The True Scale Of Modern Nuclear Weapons",
            "description": "The terrifying true scale of modern nuclear weapons is beyond what most people can imagine. Nuclear Weapons today are far more powerful than those used in World War II. For example, the B83 nuclear bomb, the largest in the U.S. arsenal, is 80 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This single Nuclear Weapon could destroy an entire city like Beijing, causing millions of deaths and injuries.\n\nSubmarine-launched missiles like the Trident II carry multiple Nuclear Weapons. Each missile can deliver up to eight warheads, each 30 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. A single Trident II could devastate a city like Moscow, resulting in over 2.8 million immediate fatalities.\n\nChina's Dongfeng 5 missile is another example of the terrifying power of Nuclear Weapons. It can carry up to 12 warheads, each 66 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. If aimed at a city like Washington, D.C., the impact would be catastrophic, with over a million fatalities.\n\nRussia's R-36 missile, known as the \"Satan\" missile, can carry multiple Nuclear Weapons with immense destructive power. Some versions can deliver a single warhead up to 20 megatons, which is over 1,300 times the Hiroshima bomb.\n\nAt the top of the list is Russia's RS-28 Sarmat missile, nicknamed \"Satan 2.\" This Nuclear Weapon can carry up to 15 warheads and potentially deliver a 50-megaton bomb, causing unimaginable destruction to cities like New York.\n\nEven though some countries may face setbacks, the existence of these Nuclear Weapons means that even a few could cause unimaginable damage. The true scale of modern Nuclear Weapons shows that in a nuclear war, there are no winners—only devastating loss for humanity.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/\nU.S. Department of Energy https://www.energy.gov/\nNational Museum of the U.S. Air Force https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon\n\n\nSubscribe to Science Time: https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24\n\n#nukes #sciencetime #nuclearwinter",

                "title": "The True Scale Of Modern Nuclear Weapons",
                "description": "The terrifying true scale of modern nuclear weapons is beyond what most people can imagine. Nuclear Weapons today are far more powerful than those used in World War II. For example, the B83 nuclear bomb, the largest in the U.S. arsenal, is 80 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This single Nuclear Weapon could destroy an entire city like Beijing, causing millions of deaths and injuries.\n\nSubmarine-launched missiles like the Trident II carry multiple Nuclear Weapons. Each missile can deliver up to eight warheads, each 30 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. A single Trident II could devastate a city like Moscow, resulting in over 2.8 million immediate fatalities.\n\nChina's Dongfeng 5 missile is another example of the terrifying power of Nuclear Weapons. It can carry up to 12 warheads, each 66 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. If aimed at a city like Washington, D.C., the impact would be catastrophic, with over a million fatalities.\n\nRussia's R-36 missile, known as the \"Satan\" missile, can carry multiple Nuclear Weapons with immense destructive power. Some versions can deliver a single warhead up to 20 megatons, which is over 1,300 times the Hiroshima bomb.\n\nAt the top of the list is Russia's RS-28 Sarmat missile, nicknamed \"Satan 2.\" This Nuclear Weapon can carry up to 15 warheads and potentially deliver a 50-megaton bomb, causing unimaginable destruction to cities like New York.\n\nEven though some countries may face setbacks, the existence of these Nuclear Weapons means that even a few could cause unimaginable damage. The true scale of modern Nuclear Weapons shows that in a nuclear war, there are no winners—only devastating loss for humanity.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/\nU.S. Department of Energy https://www.energy.gov/\nNational Museum of the U.S. Air Force https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon\n\n\nSubscribe to Science Time: https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24\n\n#nukes #sciencetime #nuclearwinter"

I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess.

            "description": "Stephen Thompson | October 25, 2024\nWhen Dua Lipa came to visit the Tiny Desk, she had nothing to prove — and much to live up to. After all, the singer’s Tiny Desk (home) concert, recorded in London in the aftermath of her 2020 blockbuster Future Nostalgia, still holds the record for the most-viewed Tiny Desk concert in history, her 130 million views surpassing even the likes of Mac Miller and Anderson .Paak. \n\nFour years later, the pop superstar finally graced the actual Tiny Desk, this time armed with four warm and inviting songs from Radical Optimism. Arriving in the first half of this year — when the dominant storylines in music so often revolved around grievances and rivalries — Radical Optimism stood out for its comparatively sunny and forgiving takes on failed and failing relationships, seduction, new love and old wounds. And, of course, it dispensed a world-beating banger in “Houdini,” which joins past Dua Lipa classics (“New Rules,” “Levitating,” “Don’t Start Now”) on her own personal Mount Rushmore.\n\nBefitting an artist whose newest songs often reflect the pursuit of personal growth — see: “Happy for You” — Lipa and her team breezed through the NPR Music offices with a mix of low-drama professionalism and unmistakable warmth. We’ve dealt with a lot of stars (and their teams) over the years, and as often as people ask us to dish about people who’ve been difficult, we’ve mostly accumulated stories of people who’ve been lovely to have around. Even among all those, Lipa and her people stood out: They were kind, gracious, fun and game.\n\nThat shows up on camera, too, as you’ll see here.
