When The ‘American Horror Story’ star and her son moved into their new home, she enlisted AD100’s Pierce & Ward to work their magic on the space. Rich florals and luxurious velvets pair with vintage furniture creating a cozy environment for Roberts to kick back and relax. Roberts was excited at the idea of making her very own grown-up dollhouse and with an extensive doll collection, her home has become just that. Ready for a new chapter in her new home, Roberts couldn’t be happier with how the space turned out. “I have a picture of the day we moved in,” Roberts says, smiling. “I’m holding him and it was the most sunny California day, and we were in front of the blue door of our new house.

Perovskites are often hailed as the next big thing for solar panels. They’re more efficient than silicon PVs could ever be, and they have higher yields. However, their fragility and short lifespans have relegated them to the lab...so far.\n\nBut 2024 is looking to be the year of the perovskite. The last few months have seen new perovskite researchers all over the world smashing records, including durability.

Avanços em Perovskitas em 2024 são o Futuro da Energia Solar. As perovskitas são frequentemente aclamadas como a próxima grande novidade para painéis solares. Elas são mais eficientes do que as células fotovoltaicas de silício poderiam ser e têm rendimentos mais altos. No entanto, sua fragilidade e curta vida útil as relegaram ao laboratório... até agora.\n\nMas 2024 está se mostrando o ano da perovskita. Nos últimos meses, novos pesquisadores de perovskita ao redor do mundo têm quebrado recordes, incluindo em durabilidade. Por causa disso, algumas dessas novas perovskitas estão até previstas para chegar ao mercado este ano. Vamos conferir alguns dos avanços mais empolgantes na área e ver por nós mesmos se as perovskitas estão finalmente prontas para sua grande estreia.

It is the first time Iran has launched a direct military attack on Israel despite decades of hostility. \nThere's been calm over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in the wake of the barrage. Almost all the missiles were intercepted by Israel and the US. The UK and Jordan have also shot down drones. Air raid sirens sounded across Israel.

Haney’s career has been marked by determination, skill, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. His upcoming bout with Ryan Garcia on April 20, 2024, promises to be a clash of titans, and fans are eagerly awaiting this showdown.\n\nIn a recent episode, Haney took listeners on a tour of his opulent Las Vegas property, where he houses an impressive collection of cars valued at over 3 million dollars. Beyond the glitz and glamour, Haney delved into the heart of boxing. He candidly discussed how popularity, rather than pure skill, often dictates who earns the big paychecks in the sport.\n\nBut it’s Haney’s unique bond with his father that truly sets him apart. Unlike other father-son duos in boxing, their success hasn’t driven them apart; instead, it has brought them closer. Haney’s admiration for his father’s guidance and unwavering support shines through in every conversation.\n\nLastly, Haney shared his list of the top 5 boxers in the game today, along with his thoughts on who truly deserves a spot in the boxing Hall of Fame. His insights are a testament to his passion for the sport and his commitment to leaving a lasting legacy.\n\n\nPRESENTING SPONSORS\n\nNew Amsterdam Vodka\nFind your wins with New Amsterdam Vodka",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

There were 75 shell casings recovered from the scene, according to the report. The first officers at the scene began lifesaving measures, including applying tourniquets and chest seal bandages.\n\nSubscribe to FOX 10 Phoenix!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNjfNLnQYbjBEvnS8KFuyGQ?sub_confirmation=1 \n\n#fox10phoenix #southside #chicago #crime #massshooting\n\nFOX 10 Phoenix delivers breaking news, live events, politics, entertainment, business news and local stories from Phoenix, Arizona and across the nation.\n\nWatch more FOX 10 Phoenix on YouTube:\n\nArizona headlines: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPtshEuaekDdk3dtuBkjdJbJ\nNational headlines: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPtq-kkrH0cQ3ZIYpLj5MGVT\nRaw footage: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPt6sLbUHtU-fjr-RTh8O_ct",

                "description": "Chicago police released new details after a child was killed and 10 other people were wounded at a family gathering on the South Side Saturday night. \n\nOfficers responded to a Shotspotter alert in the 2000 block of West 52nd Street in the Back of the Yards neighborhood at 9:18 p.m. and found several victims with gunshot wounds. \n\nA witness told police that they saw a black sedan pull up and someone inside fired multiple shots into the crowd before fleeing southbound on Damen Avenue. \n\nA family was gathered for a birthday party outside when gunmen opened fire with assault rifles and handguns, according to a police report. There were 75 shell casings recovered from the scene, according to the report. The first officers at the scene began lifesaving measures, including applying tourniquets and chest seal bandages.\n\nSubscribe to FOX 10 Phoenix!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNjfNLnQYbjBEvnS8KFuyGQ?sub_confirmation=1 \n\n#fox10phoenix #southside #chicago #crime #massshooting\n\nFOX 10 Phoenix delivers breaking news, live events, politics, entertainment, business news and local stories from Phoenix, Arizona and across the nation.\n\nWatch more FOX 10 Phoenix on YouTube:\n\nArizona headlines: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPtshEuaekDdk3dtuBkjdJbJ\nNational headlines: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPtq-kkrH0cQ3ZIYpLj5MGVT\nRaw footage: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjk-Nxa5HqPt6sLbUHtU-fjr-RTh8O_ct"

Early attempts to reach it were primarily motivated by the search for a navigable route through the Arctic to Asia, known as the Northwest Passage. Later, explorers focused specifically on reaching the Pole itself. But for centuries, reaching it seemed impossible. The polar environment was extremely unforgiving. Located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, the North Pole is covered by a vast expanse of sea ice which constantly changes due to wind, ocean currents and seasonal melts. Explorers tried to reach the pole using ships, dogsleds, and even traveling by foot. The first verified, and officially recognized expedition to reach the North Pole didn’t occur until 1926 (although several explorers claimed to have reached it earlier). It was first reached using the airship Norge, which flew overhead, but did not land on the surface.  \n\nIn the late 1920’s, accomplished explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins became convinced that a submarine would provide the ultimate means of reaching the North Pole. A submarine could travel for extended periods beneath the ice, avoiding the extreme hazards above which had caused earlier expeditions to fail. Carrying the latest scientific equipment, the submarine’s crew could conduct valuable meteorological, oceanographic, biological, magnetic, and spectrographic experiments.\n\nWilkin’s submarine would be called the Nautilus. It was a retired WW1-era submarine that had been extensively modified by renowned Naval Architect Simon Lake. The Nautilus featured a heavily reinforced bow, a shock absorber and sledge runners to protect it from collision with sea ice. A diving compartment and airlock was also added to allow divers to explore the depths while the submarine remained submerged. Most importantly, the Nautilus was fitted with three ice drills, allowing the submarine to recharge batteries, refresh air and even allow the crew to exit while the submarine still remained below the ice. \n\nThe Nautilus and her crew of 20 men began their expedition to the North Pole in June of 1931. \nNone of them realized how grueling their journey would be, and almost immediately things began to go wrong.",

                "description": "Get Nebula for just $2.50 a month here: https://go.nebula.tv/mustard\n\nWatch More Mustard Videos & Support The Channel: https://nebula.tv/mustard\n\nThanks to Wesley Dobbs for providing logos on the Russian space mirror!  https://www.artstation.com/kingvangarh\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/MustardChannel\nMustard Merchandise: https://mustardchannel.com/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/MustardVideos\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Mustard-109952378202335\n\nFor centuries, the North Pole remained elusive. Early attempts to reach it were primarily motivated by the search for a navigable route through the Arctic to Asia, known as the Northwest Passage. Later, explorers focused specifically on reaching the Pole itself. But for centuries, reaching it seemed impossible. The polar environment was extremely unforgiving. Located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, the North Pole is covered by a vast expanse of sea ice which constantly changes due to wind, ocean currents and seasonal melts. Explorers tried to reach the pole using ships, dogsleds, and even traveling by foot. The first verified, and officially recognized expedition to reach the North Pole didn’t occur until 1926 (although several explorers claimed to have reached it earlier). It was first reached using the airship Norge, which flew overhead, but did not land on the surface.  \n\nIn the late 1920’s, accomplished explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins became convinced that a submarine would provide the ultimate means of reaching the North Pole. A submarine could travel for extended periods beneath the ice, avoiding the extreme hazards above which had caused earlier expeditions to fail. Carrying the latest scientific equipment, the submarine’s crew could conduct valuable meteorological, oceanographic, biological, magnetic, and spectrographic experiments.\n\nWilkin’s submarine would be called the Nautilus. It was a retired WW1-era submarine that had been extensively modified by renowned Naval Architect Simon Lake. The Nautilus featured a heavily reinforced bow, a shock absorber and sledge runners to protect it from collision with sea ice. A diving compartment and airlock was also added to allow divers to explore the depths while the submarine remained submerged. Most importantly, the Nautilus was fitted with three ice drills, allowing the submarine to recharge batteries, refresh air and even allow the crew to exit while the submarine still remained below the ice. \n\nThe Nautilus and her crew of 20 men began their expedition to the North Pole in June of 1931. \nNone of them realized how grueling their journey would be, and almost immediately things began to go wrong."

He’s a giant toy dog who was captured by Catnap and imprisoned in a jail cell… and his legs were tragically ripped off. His design and scene in the game is pretty creepy and insane, so after making our DIY animatronic Catnap, we knew a hanging Dog Day animatronic had to be next.\n\nWe started by making some fake walls in the style of theatrical flats to act as his jail cell. His frame was made of steel and powered by pneumatics, thanks to the help of Hallucinations Creations who make amazing pneumatic animatronic mechs for the haunted house industry. We used wire, duct tape, and foam to make the shape of his body and covered the whole thing in shaggy fur. His head was custom 3D modeled and 3D printed. The whole thing was animated with a prop controller from Purgatory Props.\n\nWe love how our real life DogDay turned out! He’s an awesome pneumatic prop and he's going to make the perfect companion to our growing collection of custom Halloween animatronics like our Catnap, Huggy Wuggy and Springtrap animatronics. Who do you want to see us make next? And where do we put this giant prop now?!\n\nThanks for watching and Stay Wicked, y’all!\n\n#DogDay\n#PoppyPlaytime\n#Animatronics",

He’s a giant toy dog who was captured by Catnap and imprisoned in a jail cell… and his legs were tragically ripped off. His design and scene in the game is pretty creepy and insane, so after making our DIY animatronic Catnap, we knew a hanging Dog Day animatronic had to be next.\n\nWe started by making some fake walls in the style of theatrical flats to act as his jail cell. His frame was made of steel and powered by pneumatics, thanks to the help of Hallucinations Creations who make amazing pneumatic animatronic mechs for the haunted house industry. We used wire, duct tape, and foam to make the shape of his body and covered the whole thing in shaggy fur. His head was custom 3D modeled and 3D printed. The whole thing was animated with a prop controller from Purgatory Props.\n\nWe love how our real life DogDay turned out! He’s an awesome pneumatic prop and he's going to make the perfect companion to our growing collection of custom Halloween animatronics like our Catnap, Huggy Wuggy and Springtrap animatronics. Who do you want to see us make next? And where do we put this giant prop now?!\n\nThanks for watching and Stay Wicked, y’all!\n\n#DogDay\n#PoppyPlaytime\n#Animatronics"
