This year, we’re making a life sized real Withered Foxy animatronic, complete with a full endoskeleton. The Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie is currently filming and we’ve been seeing all of these amazing BTS photos of the animatronics, and it inspired us to make our own.\n\nTo make Foxy we’re doing an Halloween animatronic makeover, and we started with a Pirate animatronic from Home Depot called Captain Cuts. He has a ton of servo motors to animate his face and head, and a great pirate swagger that should translate nicely to Foxy the Pirate. \n\nWe carved Foxy’s giant feet and the rest of his endoskeleton out of foam, weathered it, and painted it silver. His suit and head were mostly 3D printed and covered in fleece and faux suede. We had to completely disassemble Capt. Cut’s face and adapt all of the servo mounts to match Foxy’s proportions. \n\nIf you want to see more of our Halloween Decorations and Animatronics tutorials, we have a TON on our channel.\n\nFoxy is going to look great next to our custom Springtrap and Puppet animatronics. Maybe one day we’ll create enough FNAF animatronics to make Five Nights at Freddy’s in real life. That's a good idea, right…?\n\nUntil next time, Happy Halloween and Stay Wicked!\n\nOUR CAMERA/FILMING GEAR ►\nOur Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3PEaILC\nSecondary Camera: https://amzn.to/46jDrfF (or iPhone)\nMicrophones: https://amzn.to/3rBM5XO\nMost Used Lens: https://amzn.to/3LMWhng\nMain Tripod: https://amzn.to/46q8WV4\nLight #1: https://amzn.to/3Q0lVX5\nLight #2 (cheaper): https://amzn.to/3PJzBp0\nC-Stands: https://amzn.to/3LMamB8\nColored Lights (mounted): https://amzn.to/3PEKfgS\nColored Lights (handheld): https://amzn.to/3F1fJc3\nSoftbox: https://amzn.to/46zLTal\nSoftbox Lantern: https://amzn.to/46wtJ9x\nGimbal: https://amzn.to/3ZHgNv5\nCamera Bag (for travel): https://amzn.to/46cHdY1\n\n#FNAF\n#Animatronic\n#Halloween",

This year, we’re making a life sized real Withered Foxy animatronic, complete with a full endoskeleton. The Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie is currently filming and we’ve been seeing all of these amazing BTS photos of the animatronics, and it inspired us to make our own.\n\nTo make Foxy we’re doing an Halloween animatronic makeover, and we started with a Pirate animatronic from Home Depot called Captain Cuts. He has a ton of servo motors to animate his face and head, and a great pirate swagger that should translate nicely to Foxy the Pirate. \n\nWe carved Foxy’s giant feet and the rest of his endoskeleton out of foam, weathered it, and painted it silver. His suit and head were mostly 3D printed and covered in fleece and faux suede. We had to completely disassemble Capt. Cut’s face and adapt all of the servo mounts to match Foxy’s proportions. \n\nIf you want to see more of our Halloween Decorations and Animatronics tutorials, we have a TON on our channel.\n\nFoxy is going to look great next to our custom Springtrap and Puppet animatronics. Maybe one day we’ll create enough FNAF animatronics to make Five Nights at Freddy’s in real life. That's a good idea, right…?\n\nUntil next time, Happy Halloween and Stay Wicked!\n\nOUR CAMERA/FILMING GEAR ►\nOur Main Camera: https://amzn.to/3PEaILC\nSecondary Camera: https://amzn.to/46jDrfF (or iPhone)\nMicrophones: https://amzn.to/3rBM5XO\nMost Used Lens: https://amzn.to/3LMWhng\nMain Tripod: https://amzn.to/46q8WV4\nLight #1: https://amzn.to/3Q0lVX5\nLight #2 (cheaper): https://amzn.to/3PJzBp0\nC-Stands: https://amzn.to/3LMamB8\nColored Lights (mounted): https://amzn.to/3PEKfgS\nColored Lights (handheld): https://amzn.to/3F1fJc3\nSoftbox: https://amzn.to/46zLTal\nSoftbox Lantern: https://amzn.to/46wtJ9x\nGimbal: https://amzn.to/3ZHgNv5\nCamera Bag (for travel): https://amzn.to/46cHdY1\n\n#FNAF\n#Animatronic\n#Halloween"

            "description": "Support the channel by shopping through this link: https://amzn.to/3RIqU0u\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/d4a\nBecome a member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwosUnVH6AINmxtqkNJ3Fbg/join\nGrit: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3YSIPcvJsYbwGCDLNiIKA\nLink to the patent: https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/18585308/ifw/docs?application=\n\nJust a few days ago news has surfaced on the internet that Porsche has patented a revolutionary new six stroke engine which according to them has the power benefits of a two stroke engine but the durabtility and emissions cleanliness of a four stroke engine. \n\nAs you probably know traditional four stroke engines which powers virtually every combustion car, truck or motorcycle on the roads today gooes intake, compression, combustion and exhaust.\n\nPorsche new design adds one more combustion and more compression stroke into the mix and so the new engine goes: intake compression combustion compression combustion exhaust. \n\nThis relies on 100% existing technology. Gears, rod, crank, piston. Even the ports which are known as scavenging ports are ancient. Btw, this very arrangement with ports on one side and valves on the other is known as uniflow scavenging. Because the flow goes in a uniform direction through the cylinder. And this is very common on two stroke diesels in ships and locomotives. The six stroke also don’t make any serious problems for the camshafts. Instead of rotating at half the crankshaft speed, the camshafts will now rotate at one-third the crankshaft speed, so we just need a slightly larger cam gear and we also need an additional lobe on the exhaust come and that’s pretty much it, nothing complex. So there are really no novel mechanics in this which means that it doesn’t need heavy investments into research and development to get it to market. \n\nIt does make more power than a traditional four-stroke. If we observe the first 720 degrees of rotation we can see that we get only one combustion event, just like a traditional four-stroke. But if we observe the next 360 degrees we will see another combustion event starting at 720 degrees of rotation. This does not happen in the traditional four-stroke until we reach 1080 degrees of rotation.\n\nSo if we observe let’s say 7200 degrees of rotation, the traditional four-stroke will perform 10 combustion events. The six stroke will perform  13.34 combustion events. So that’s 33.4% more power than a traditional four-stroke. Now, it’s definitely not in two-stroke territory because a two stroke will perform 20 combustion events in 7200 degrees of rotation and that’s 20 equal, proper combustion events. Remember, on the six stroke, every other combustion event is a mix of exhaust gas and air and fuel which means that we’re probably not looking at a power increase of 33.4% but likely something closer to 25%. But 25% more power with existing technology and emissions cleanliness and durability of a traditional four stroke is still a very significant improvement and a very clever and rational way towards more power. \nSomething else this makes possible is to run very high boost pressure and still be relatively emissions-friendly. To run something like 3 bar boost pressure which is 45 psi you need to run very very rich. You make crazy power but you’re also sending some unburned fuel into the atmosphere which means crappy emissions. But in a six-stroke we would not send all that unburned fuel out. We would send just a bit of it out and the rest would be burned during the next combustion stroke. So potentially, big power and government approval. \n\n\nBut why would Porsche patent this now if sales of new combustion vehicles will be banned starting with 2035 in the EU and I believe some other parts of the world.?\n\nWell, here’s the thing, the EU is not fully banning sales of new combustion vehicles starting with 2035. \nOn the 25th of March of 2023 EU reached an agreement with Germany where it was agreed that sales of and registration of new ICE vehicles will be permitted after 2035, provided that those vehicles operate only on carbon-neutral fuels. \n\nSo what this patent means is that Porsche is taking preventive measures to ensure that it can produce high-power and emissions-friendly engines that can still fit inside the back of a 911 in case e-fuel production ramps up before 2035. By patenting this design Porsche ensures that nobody else can implement it without paying fees to them.\n\nSo will we see this engine in the future? Well, if e-fuel production does actually ramp up, I think it’s likely that Porsche will greenlight some sort of project. Will e-fuel be expensive? Probably. But I doubt that’s a major problem for Porsche buyers. \n\nA special thank you to my patrons:\nDaniel\nMarwan Hassan11\nPeter Della Flora\nBashuan\nAllan McKay\nvalkq\nZwoa Meda Beda\nToma Marini\nCole Philips\n\n#d4a #porsche #sixstroke\n\n00:00 How it works\n08:34 Benefits\n14: 34 Drawbacks\n19:01 Why now?",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 2 nights on Amtrak…\n2:03 Meet my mom :) \n3:03 Dramatic start\n7:35 day 2 9 hours in\n13:02 Tour of our tiny bunk room\n22:40 Fugitive onboard + police stop…\n29:30 day 3 - 31 hours in \n34:48 Neurologist/Epilepsy update\n37:49 bloops",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 2 nights on Amtrak…\n2:03 Meet my mom :) \n3:03 Dramatic start\n7:35 day 2 9 hours in\n13:02 Tour of our tiny bunk room\n22:40 Fugitive onboard + police stop…\n29:30 day 3 - 31 hours in \n34:48 Neurologist/Epilepsy update\n37:49 bloops"

Neighboring Newport, TN has had much more challenges along with I-40 near the North Carolina & Tennessee border.

We then drive into Gatlinburg Tennessee to see how bad the Gatlinburg flooding is and see the Gatlinburg crowd levels after hurricane helene.  Thankfully there was not too smoky mountain flooding and most of the major roads were able to remain open.  We also check out the Dollywood crowds and hopefully give you peace of mind about your upcoming visit!",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

This video captures the sheer power of the storm as it ravaged this iconic Florida fishing village, leaving behind destruction in its wake. Watch as storm surge waters flood the streets, tearing apart docks, businesses, and boats. See firsthand the impact on local landmarks, with debris strewn everywhere and once-thriving shops and restaurants left in ruins. Witness the heart of John’s Pass under siege from nature’s fury, illustrating the community’s resilience in the face of one of the most powerful hurricanes to strike the area.

ROBLOX DTI CODES\n\nIn this video, I will be showing you all of the newest Dress to Impress Codes for the NEWEST September 2024 Update in DTI! Be sure to leave a like and a subscribe if you enjoyed.\n\n⭐Discord Server:  https://discord.gg/ckXM3SDerp\n⭐Roblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/5177996/Blues-Squad#!/about\n⭐Roblox Profile: https://www.roblox.com/users/569518721/profile\n⭐Twitter: https://twitter.com/Blueqlow\n\n⭐ ROBLOX MERCH: \nShirts: https://www.roblox.com/catalog/18671742852/Blueqlow-250K-Merch\nPants: https://www.roblox.com/catalog/18774056302/Blueqlow-Pants\n\n➡️ Join this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6hQ9fEM9SvJiBHylJJcgnQ/join\n\nWhat is ROBLOX?\n\nROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, you to ­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\nAll of my videos follow YouTube's TOS.

            "description": "Thanks to Olay for sponsoring us & helping make this video come to life! You can check out Olay’s new cleansing melts here: https://www.Olay.com/CleansingMelts #ad\n\nSo as some of you guys might know, I am a bit of a historical fashion nerd - over the years, we’ve done a number of decade fashion videos about the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, *and* 00s, we’ve tried on vintage wedding dresses, and we have even gotten a full 18th century Colonial Williamsburg makeover.\n\nAnd whenever we go on these little journeys to the past, it’s always really fun when we’re able to have Tyler dress up as well to explore the decades with me (his 1980s Flock of Eagles haircut still comes to me in the sweetest of dreams).\n\nSo we decided to go full couples historical makeover - and do a whole video of them!

            "description": "🎵 Finally we’re back to who we’re meant to be 🎵\nHere's a sneak peek of the new song “We’re Back” from Disney’s #Moana2. Only in theaters November 27! \n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios’ epic animated musical “Moana 2” reunites Moana (voice of Cravalho) and Maui (voice of Johnson) three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced. Directed by David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller, and produced by Christina Chen and Yvett Merino, “Moana 2” features music by Grammy® winners Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear, Grammy nominee Opetaia Foa‘i, and three-time Grammy winner Mark Mancina. Jared Bush and Miller are writing the film, which is executive produced by Jennifer Lee, Bush and Johnson. \n\nThe film also features returning stars Rachel House (Moana’s Grandma, Tala), Temuera Morrison (Moana’s father, Chief Tui) and Nicole Scherzinger (Moana’s mother, Sina), as well as the voices of Hualālai Chung, David Fane and Rose Matafeo as Moana’s new crew members Moni, Kele and Loto, respectively. Awhimai Fraser voices mysterious new character Matangi; Gerald Ramsey plays Moana’s ancestor, Tautai Vasa; and Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda lends her voice to Moana’s adoring and adorable little sister, Simea.\n \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\n#moana2",
