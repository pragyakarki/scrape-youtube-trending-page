ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

By combining various effects, sound design, and AI technologies, I’ve crafted a cinematic experience that reimagines familiar worlds in bold and imaginative ways.

Thank you for your support — now let’s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. 🎬✨\n\n— In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story follows a fragile offshoot of the timeline created during the events of Avengers: Endgame, where Thanos survives not as a conqueror but as an exile who has deliberately abandoned power, ideology, and destiny in search of quiet absolution. Believing the universe has moved on without him, Thanos comes to understand that time itself does not forget, and that unresolved fractures from the Time Heist continue to destabilize reality across the multiverse. As these fractures resurface, his very existence becomes a threat to the fragile world he now inhabits, forcing him to confront the truth that retreat does not absolve responsibility. Torn between remaining a silent witness to collapse or reclaiming agency over the consequences he helped create, Thanos is pushed toward a final reckoning that reframes his role not as a tyrant chasing balance, but as a singular force capable of shaping what survives when inevitability returns.\n\n—  Subscribe to Teaser Universe 🎬\n—  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#doctordoom #marvel #doomsday\n\navengers doomsday trailer,avengers doomsday,avengers doomsday new trailer,doomsday trailer,avengers doomsday official trailer,doomsday wakanda trailer,doomsday wakanda teaser leak,doomsday teaser,doomsday x men trailer,doomsday teaser 4,doomsday trailer 4,doomsday leak,doomsday fantastic four teaser,wakanda doomsday trailer,wakanda doomsday trailer leaked,avengers doomsday teaser,avengers doomsday marvel trailer,x men avengers doomsday trailer leak",

Wir veranstalten außerdem jede Menge Gewinnspiele – NUR auf Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nWir sind ZURÜCK im Casino mit einer neuen Folge eurer Lieblings-YouTube-Serie „Wheel Wednesday“. Schreibt eure Spielidee in die Kommentare, ich werfe sie aufs Rad und drehe es! Danke fürs Zuschauen! Ich freue mich riesig über eure Unterstützung auf diesem Weg. Drückt mir die Daumen, und wir sehen uns in der nächsten Folge! Auf geht's!\n\nBrettski justierte die Kamera ein letztes Mal und grinste gequält. Seine Nervosität war kaum zu erkennen. Wieder ein Wheel Wednesday. Wieder ein Stapel ausgedruckter Zuschauerkommentare, ausgeschnitten und auf das riesige, sich drehende Rad neben ihm geklebt. Blackjack-Herausforderungen. Roulette-Versuche. Spielautomaten-Strafen, die ihm schon beim Lesen ein flaues Gefühl im Magen bereiteten. Diese Serie hatte ihn berühmt gemacht – und konnte ihn auch zerstören.\n\nEr klopfte dem Rad feierlich auf den Kopf. „Was auch immer es anzeigt“, murmelte er, „wir fahren mit.“\n\nDas Rad drehte sich schnell, das Klicken hallte lauter als der Lärm des Casinos um ihn herum. Brettski sah zu, wie die Kommentare verschwammen, bis – klick – klick – klick – es langsamer wurde. Dann blieb es stehen.\n\nSein Lächeln erstarrte.\n\n„Setz dein gesamtes Guthaben auf eine Blackjack-Hand … kein Teilen, kein Verdoppeln.“\n\nDas mulmige Gefühl in seinem Magen verstärkte sich noch, als er den Benutzernamen unter der Herausforderung erkannte.\n\nOnTiltNick.\n\nBrettski atmete scharf durch die Nase aus. Natürlich war es Nick. Sein Erzfeind hatte den Kommentar eingeschmuggelt, weil er genau wusste, wie der Wheel Wednesday funktionierte – er wusste, dass Brettski ihn nicht ignorieren konnte, er wusste, dass das Publikum von ihm verlangen würde, die Herausforderung anzunehmen. Es war nicht nur eine Herausforderung. Es war Sabotage.\n\nDer Dealer nickte ruhig, als Brettski seinen letzten Chip vor sich stapelte. Kameras zoomten heran. Der Chat explodierte. Seine Hände zitterten, als die Karten aufgedeckt wurden – eine erbärmliche Summe. Eine schwache.\n\nDer Dealer deckte seine offene Karte auf.\n\nStark.\n\nBrettski schluckte und zwang sich zu einem Grinsen in die Kamera. „Genau das wollte Nick“, sagte er leise. „Jetzt ist der Moment gekommen.“\n\nDer Dealer griff nach dem Kartenschlitten.\n\nDann stand alles still.\n\nEin Pitboss beugte sich vor und flüsterte etwas Dringendes. Die Augen des Dealers weiteten sich. Die Karten erstarrten mitten auf dem Tisch. Die Casinolichter flackerten ein- … zweimal.\n\nBrettski blickte direkt in die Kamera, als der Bildschirm schwarz wurde. Das Klicken des Rouletterads hallte leise hinter ihm wider.\n\nUnd die Hand – sein gesamtes Spielkapital – war noch immer nicht entschieden.\n\n#Spielautomaten #Blackjack #Glücksspiel #Casino #Baccarat #Roulette\n\nWer ist Brettski? Brettski ist ein professioneller Spieler, vergleichbar mit den alten Legenden Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot oder Lady Luck HQ! Doch im Gegensatz zu ihnen verfügt Brettski über jahrtausendealtes Wissen, das von den Ältesten überliefert wurde, und beherrscht Fähigkeiten wie Spielautomaten, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker und Baccarat. Brettskis Ziel als professioneller Spieler ist einfach: ganz Las Vegas zu beherrschen – mit dem Geld, das er durch Glücksspiel verdient.

                "description": "Unisciti al mio Discord per passare del tempo con me e la nostra community! Offriamo anche un sacco di giveaway SOLO su Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nSiamo TORNATI al Casinò, con un altro episodio della serie YouTube preferita da tutti, \"Wheel Wednesday\". Lasciate un commento con la vostra idea di gioco d'azzardo, io la lancio sulla ruota e la faccio GIRARE! Grazie per aver guardato! Apprezzo ognuno di voi per il supporto in questo viaggio. Auguratemi buona fortuna e ci vediamo alla prossima! Andiamo in guerra!\n\nBrettski aggiustò la telecamera un'ultima volta e abbozzò un sorriso che a malapena nascose il nervosismo che gli ronzava sotto la pelle. Un altro Wheel Wednesday. Un'altra pila di commenti degli spettatori stampati, ritagliati e attaccati con lo scotch sull'enorme ruota che girava accanto a lui. Sfide al Blackjack. Ave Maria alla Roulette. Punizioni alle slot machine che gli facevano stringere lo stomaco solo a leggerle. Questa è stata la serie che lo ha reso tale, e quella che avrebbe potuto distruggerlo.\n\nDò alla ruota un colpetto cerimoniale. \"Qualunque cosa capiti\", borbottò, \"giochiamo.\"\n\nLa ruota girava veloce, i clic echeggiavano più forti del rumore del casinò intorno a lui. Brettski guardò i commenti confondersi finché... clic... clic... clic... rallentò. Poi si fermò.\n\nIl suo sorriso si congelò.\n\n\"Scommetti tutto il tuo bankroll su una mano di blackjack... niente split, niente raddoppi.\"\n\nIl nodo allo stomaco gli si fece ancora più forte quando riconobbe il nome utente stampato sotto la sfida.\n\nOnTiltNick.\n\nBrettski espirò bruscamente dal naso. Certo che era Nick. Il suo arcinemico aveva infilato il commento sapendo esattamente come funzionava il Wheel Wednesday, sapendo che Brettski non poteva ignorarlo, sapendo che il pubblico gli avrebbe chiesto di portare a termine il compito. Non era solo una sfida. Era un sabotaggio.\n\nIl croupier annuì con calma mentre Brettski impilava fino all'ultima fiche davanti a lui. Le telecamere si avvicinarono. La conversazione esplose. Le sue mani tremavano mentre le carte uscivano: un totale orribile. Un totale debole.\n\nIl mazziere girò la sua carta scoperta.\n\nForte.\n\nBrettski deglutì, sforzandosi di sorridere all'obiettivo. \"Questo è ciò che Nick voleva\", disse a bassa voce. \"Questo è il momento.\"\n\nIl mazziere allungò la mano verso il sabot.\n\nPoi tutto si fermò.\n\nUn responsabile di sala si sporse, sussurrando qualcosa di urgente. Gli occhi del mazziere si spalancarono. Le carte si bloccarono a metà tavolo. Le luci del casinò tremolarono una... due volte.\n\nBrettski guardò dritto in camera mentre lo schermo diventava nero, il suono del ticchettio della ruota echeggiava debolmente dietro di lui.\n\nE la mano, l'intero bankroll, non era ancora stata decisa.\n\n#slot #blackjack #gioco d'azzardo #casinò #baccarat #roulette\n\nChi è Brettski? Brettski è un giocatore d'azzardo professionista, simile alle antiche leggende Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot o Lady Luck HQ! Tuttavia, a differenza di queste leggende, Brettski ha migliaia di anni di conoscenze antiche accumulate dagli anziani, in abilità come slot machine, roulette, blackjack, dadi, Bubble Craps, poker e baccarat. L'obiettivo di Brettski come giocatore d'azzardo professionista è semplice: possedere tutta Las Vegas, utilizzando i fondi guadagnati con il gioco d'azzardo.

                "description": "Junte-se ao meu Discord para conversar comigo e com a nossa comunidade! Também fazemos vários sorteios EXCLUSIVAMENTE no Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nEstamos de VOLTA ao Cassino, com mais um episódio da série favorita de todos no YouTube, \"Quarta-feira da Roda\". Você deixa um comentário com a sua ideia de aposta, eu coloco na roda e GIRE! Obrigado por assistir! Agradeço a cada um de vocês pelo apoio nessa jornada. Me desejem sorte e nos vemos no próximo episódio! Vamos à guerra!\n\nBrettski ajustou a câmera pela última vez e esboçou um sorriso que mal escondia o nervosismo que o consumia. Mais uma Quarta-feira da Roda. Mais uma pilha de comentários de espectadores impressos, recortados e colados na enorme roda giratória ao seu lado. Desafios de Blackjack. Apostas desesperadas na Roleta. Punições em máquinas caça-níqueis que só de ler já lhe davam um nó no estômago. Essa era a série que o havia consagrado — e a que poderia destruí-lo.\n\nEle deu uma batidinha cerimonial na roda. “Seja qual for o resultado”, murmurou ele, “vamos apostar”.\n\nA roleta girou rapidamente, os cliques ecoando mais alto que o barulho do cassino ao seu redor. Brettski observou os comentários se misturarem até que — clique — clique — clique — a velocidade diminuiu. E parou.\n\nSeu sorriso congelou.\n\n“Aposte toda a sua banca em uma mão de blackjack… sem dividir, sem dobrar.”\n\nO aperto no estômago aumentou ainda mais quando ele reconheceu o nome de usuário impresso abaixo do desafio.\n\nOnTiltNick.\n\nBrettski soltou um suspiro forte pelo nariz. Claro que era o Nick. Seu arqui-inimigo havia inserido o comentário sabendo exatamente como funcionava a Quarta-feira da Roleta — sabendo que Brettski não poderia ignorá-lo, sabendo que o público exigiria que ele cumprisse o desafio. Não era apenas um desafio. Era sabotagem.\n\nO crupiê assentiu calmamente enquanto Brettski empilhava todas as suas fichas. As câmeras deram um zoom. O chat explodiu. Suas mãos tremiam enquanto as cartas eram distribuídas — um total ruim. Um total fraco.\n\nO crupiê virou sua carta aberta.\n\nForte.\n\nBrettski engoliu em seco, forçando um sorriso para a câmera. \"Era isso que o Nick queria\", disse ele baixinho. \"Este é o momento.\"\n\nO crupiê levou a mão ao sapato.\n\nEntão tudo parou.\n\nUm supervisor de mesa se inclinou, sussurrando algo urgente. Os olhos do crupiê se arregalaram. As cartas congelaram no meio da mesa. As luzes do cassino piscaram uma vez... duas vezes.\n\nBrettski olhou diretamente para a câmera enquanto a tela escurecia, o som do clique da roleta ecoando fracamente atrás dele.\n\nE a mão — todo o seu dinheiro — ainda não havia sido decidida.\n\n#caça-níqueis #blackjack #apostas #cassino #bacará #roleta\n\nQuem é Brettski? Brettski é um jogador profissional, semelhante às antigas lendas Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot ou Lady Luck HQ! No entanto, ao contrário dessas lendas, Brettski possui milhares de anos de conhecimento ancestral acumulado pelos anciãos, em habilidades como caça-níqueis, roleta, blackjack, craps, bubble craps, pôquer e bacará. O objetivo de Brettski como jogador profissional é simples: dominar Las Vegas, usando os fundos obtidos com jogos de azar. Inscreva-se para apoiar sua jornada rumo à dominação mundial."

                "description": "Rejoignez mon serveur Discord pour discuter avec moi et notre communauté ! On organise aussi plein de concours EXCLUSIVEMENT sur Discord ! : https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nOn est de retour au Casino pour un nouvel épisode de « La Roue du Mercredi », la série YouTube préférée de tous. Laissez un commentaire avec votre idée de jeu, je la lance sur la roue et je la fais tourner ! Merci de regarder ! Je suis très reconnaissant de votre soutien. Souhaitez-moi bonne chance, et on se retrouve pour le prochain épisode ! Que la guerre commence !\n\nBrettski ajusta la caméra une dernière fois et esquissa un sourire qui dissimulait à peine la nervosité qui le tenaillait. Encore une « Roue du Mercredi ». Encore une pile de commentaires imprimés, découpés et collés sur l'immense roue qui tournait à côté de lui. Des défis au blackjack. Des coups de poker à la roulette. Des punitions aux machines à sous qui lui donnaient la nausée rien qu'à les lire. C'était la série qui l'avait fait grandir… et celle qui pouvait le détruire.\n\nIl donna un petit coup de pouce à la roue. « Peu importe sur quoi elle s'arrête », marmonna-t-il, « on joue. »\n\nLa roue tourna à toute vitesse, les cliquetis résonnant plus fort que le brouhaha du casino. Brettski vit les commentaires se mélanger jusqu'à ce que… clic… clic… clic… le rythme ralentisse. Puis s'arrête.\n\nSon sourire se figea.\n\n« Misez tout votre capital sur une main de blackjack… sans séparer, sans doubler. »\n\nUn nœud se forma dans son estomac lorsqu'il reconnut le pseudo imprimé sous le défi.\n\nOnTiltNick.\n\nBrettski expira bruyamment par le nez. Bien sûr que c'était Nick. Son ennemi juré avait glissé ce commentaire en sachant parfaitement comment fonctionnait le « Mercredi de la Roue » — sachant que Brettski ne pourrait pas l'ignorer, sachant que le public exigerait qu'il aille jusqu'au bout. Ce n'était pas juste un défi. C'était du sabotage.\n\nLe croupier hocha calmement la tête tandis que Brettski empilait tous ses jetons. Les caméras zoomèrent. Le chat s'enflamma. Ses mains tremblaient à la distribution des cartes — un total catastrophique. Une faible.\n\nLe croupier retourna sa carte.\n\nForte.\n\nBrettski déglutit, forçant un sourire devant l'objectif. « C'est ce que Nick voulait », murmura-t-il. « C'est le moment. »\n\nLe croupier prit le sabot.\n\nPuis tout s'arrêta.\n\nUn chef de table se pencha et chuchota quelque chose d'urgent. Les yeux du croupier s'écarquillèrent. Les cartes se figèrent au milieu de la table. Les lumières du casino vacillèrent une fois… deux fois.\n\nBrettski fixa la caméra tandis que l'écran devenait noir, le cliquetis de la roulette résonnant faiblement derrière lui.\n\nEt la main – toute sa bankroll – n'était toujours pas décidée.\n\n#machinesàsous #blackjack #jeuxdargent #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nQui est Brettski ? Brettski est un joueur professionnel, à l'instar des légendes Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot ou Lady Luck HQ ! Cependant, contrairement à ces légendes, Brettski possède un savoir ancestral millénaire, transmis par les anciens, et maîtrise des jeux tels que les machines à sous, la roulette, le blackjack, le craps, le bubble craps, le poker et le baccarat.

Kami juga mengadakan banyak giveaway HANYA di Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nKami KEMBALI ke Kasino, dengan episode lain dari serial YouTube favorit semua orang, “Wheel Wednesday”. Kalian tinggalkan komentar dengan ide perjudian kalian, saya akan memasukkannya ke roda dan MEMUTARNYA! Terima kasih telah menonton! Saya menghargai dukungan kalian semua dalam perjalanan ini. Doakan saya beruntung, dan sampai jumpa di episode selanjutnya! Mari kita berperang!\n\nBrettski menyesuaikan kamera untuk terakhir kalinya dan tersenyum lebar yang hampir tidak bisa menyembunyikan rasa gugup yang menggetarkan hatinya. Wheel Wednesday lainnya. Tumpukan komentar penonton lainnya dicetak, dipotong, dan ditempelkan ke roda berputar besar di sampingnya. Tantangan Blackjack. Taruhan Roulette. Hukuman mesin slot yang membuat perutnya menegang hanya dengan membacanya. Inilah serial yang membentuknya—dan yang juga bisa menghancurkannya.\n\nDia mengetuk roda itu dengan penuh hormat. “Apa pun yang muncul,” gumamnya, “kita akan ikut.”\n\nRoda berputar cepat, bunyi kliknya bergema lebih keras daripada suara kasino di sekitarnya. Brettski memperhatikan komentar-komentar itu bercampur menjadi satu hingga—klik—klik—klik—melambat. Lalu berhenti.\n\nSenyumnya membeku.\n\n“Pertaruhkan seluruh uangmu dalam satu putaran blackjack… tanpa split, tanpa double.”\n\nPerasaan tidak nyaman di perutnya semakin memburuk ketika ia mengenali nama pengguna yang tercetak di bawah tantangan itu.\n\nOnTiltNick.\n\nBrettski menghela napas tajam melalui hidungnya. Tentu saja itu Nick. Musuh bebuyutannya telah menyelipkan komentar itu dengan mengetahui persis bagaimana Wheel Wednesday bekerja—mengetahui Brettski tidak bisa mengabaikannya, mengetahui penonton akan menuntutnya untuk menindaklanjuti. Itu bukan hanya tantangan. Itu adalah sabotase.\n\nDealer mengangguk tenang saat Brettski menumpuk semua chip terakhir di depannya. Kamera memperbesar gambar. Obrolan meledak. Tangannya gemetar saat kartu-kartu keluar—total yang buruk. Total yang lemah.\n\nDealer membuka kartunya.\n\nHebat.\n\nBrettski menelan ludah, memaksakan senyum untuk kamera. “Ini yang diinginkan Nick,” katanya pelan. “Inilah momennya.”\n\nDealer meraih tumpukan kartu.\n\nLalu semuanya berhenti.\n\nSeorang pengawas meja kasino mencondongkan tubuh, membisikkan sesuatu yang mendesak. Mata dealer melebar. Kartu-kartu membeku di tengah meja. Lampu kasino berkedip sekali… dua kali.\n\nBrettski menatap langsung ke kamera saat layar menjadi hitam, suara putaran roda terdengar samar di belakangnya.\n\nDan kartu itu—seluruh modalnya—masih belum diputuskan.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nSiapa Brettski? Brettski adalah Penjudi Profesional, mirip dengan legenda lama Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, atau Lady Luck HQ!

Agradezco a todos por su apoyo en este viaje. ¡Deséenme suerte y nos vemos en la próxima! ¡Vamos a la guerra!\n\nBrettski ajustó la cámara una última vez y esbozó una sonrisa que apenas disimuló los nervios que le azotaban. Otro Miércoles de Rueda. Otra pila de comentarios de los espectadores impresos, recortados y pegados en la enorme ruleta giratoria a su lado. Retos de blackjack. Avemarías de ruleta. Castigos de tragamonedas que le revolvían el estómago con solo leerlos. Esta fue la serie que lo forjó, y la que podría destruirlo.\n\nDio un golpe ceremonial a la ruleta. “Donde caiga”, murmuró, “nosotros jugamos”.\n\nLa ruleta giraba rápido, los clics resonaban más fuerte que el ruido del casino a su alrededor. Brettski observó cómo los comentarios se mezclaban hasta que —clic—clic—clic—se ralentizó. Luego se detuvo.\n\nSu sonrisa se congeló.\n\n“Apuesta todo tu bankroll en una mano de blackjack… sin dividir, sin doblar”.\n\nEl nudo en el estómago se le hizo aún más profundo al reconocer el nombre de usuario impreso debajo del desafío.\n\nOnTiltNick.\n\nBrettski exhaló bruscamente por la nariz. Por supuesto que era Nick. Su archienemigo había dejado caer el comentario sabiendo exactamente cómo funcionaba el Miércoles de la Ruleta; sabiendo que Brettski no podía ignorarlo, sabiendo que el público le exigiría que lo cumpliera. No era solo un desafío. Era un sabotaje.\n\nEl crupier asintió con calma mientras Brettski apilaba hasta la última ficha frente a él. Las cámaras se acercaron. El chat explotó. Le temblaban las manos al ver las cartas: un total horrible. Una floja.\n\nEl crupier volteó su carta descubierta.\n\nFuerte.\n\nBrettski tragó saliva, forzando una sonrisa para la lente. \"Esto es lo que Nick quería\", dijo en voz baja. \"Este es el momento\".\n\nEl crupier tomó la baraja.\n\nEntonces todo se detuvo.\n\nUn jefe de sala se inclinó, susurrando algo urgente. El crupier abrió mucho los ojos. Las cartas se congelaron en medio de la mesa. Las luces del casino parpadearon una… dos veces.\n\nBrettski miró directamente a la cámara mientras la pantalla se oscurecía; el sonido del clic de la ruleta resonaba débilmente detrás de él.\n\nY la mano —todo su bankroll— aún no se había decidido.\n\n#tragamonedas #blackjack #juegos #casino #bacará #ruleta\n\n¿Quién es Brettski? ¡Brettski es un jugador profesional, similar a las antiguas leyendas Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot o Lady Luck HQ!

We also run a bunch of giveaways ONLY on Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nWe are BACK at the Casino, with yet another episode of everyone’s favorite YouTube series “Wheel Wednesday”. You leave a comment with your gambling idea, I throw it on the wheel and SPIN IT! Thank you for watching! I appreciate each and everyone of you supporting me on this journey. Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nBrettski adjusted the camera one last time and cracked a grin that barely hid the nerves buzzing under his skin. Another Wheel Wednesday. Another stack of viewer comments printed out, cut, and taped onto the massive spinning wheel beside him. Blackjack dares. Roulette hail-marys. Slot machine punishments that made his stomach tighten just reading them. This was the series that made him—and the one that could break him.\n\nHe gave the wheel a ceremonial tap. “Whatever it lands on,” he muttered, “we ride.”\n\nThe wheel spun fast, the clicks echoing louder than the casino noise around him. Brettski watched the comments blur together until—click—click—click—it slowed. Then stopped.\n\nHis smile froze.\n\n“Bet your entire bankroll on one hand of blackjack… no splits, no doubles.”\n\nThe pit in his stomach dropped even further when he recognized the username printed beneath the challenge.\n\nOnTiltNick.\n\nBrettski exhaled sharply through his nose. Of course it was Nick. His arch nemesis had slipped the comment in knowing exactly how Wheel Wednesday worked—knowing Brettski couldn’t ignore it, knowing the audience would demand he follow through. It wasn’t just a challenge. It was sabotage.\n\nThe dealer nodded calmly as Brettski stacked every last chip in front of him. Cameras zoomed in. Chat exploded. His hands shook as the cards came out—an ugly total. A weak one.\n\nThe dealer flipped his upcard.\n\nStrong.\n\nBrettski swallowed, forcing a grin for the lens. “This is what Nick wanted,” he said quietly. “This is the moment.”\n\nThe dealer reached for the shoe.\n\nThen everything stopped.\n\nA pit boss leaned in, whispering something urgent. The dealer’s eyes widened. The cards froze mid-table. The casino lights flickered once… twice.\n\nBrettski looked straight into the camera as the screen cut to black, the sound of the wheel’s clicking echoing faintly behind him.\n\nAnd the hand—his entire bankroll—still hadn’t been decided.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, or Lady Luck HQ!

How is it going today? Today we are going to be playing a new game about BEING A BABY!!! Yup, I am turning into a baby today but it will make sense like 2 minutes into the video haha. We are playing Goodnight Universe and this game looks like one of those games that will make you cry. You take the role of a baby that was just born and you have to navigate life as you observe your family but can’t really interact with anyone. Until one day when everything changes… haha! We are going to see how amazing the story of this game is, and if you guys want, we can try to get some endings and maybe secret endings if the game has any! Let’s have some fun and discover what happens! Join me on this amazing and emotional journey as we discover what happens when WE ARE A BABY!!!

I made a music video tribute to Asmongold — a song I built off the themes and vibes from one of his YouTube videos, mixed with references to his personality, memorable internet moments, and fan-favorite streamer lore.\n\nAsmongold (real name Zack Hoyt) isn’t just a streamer — he’s one of the most searched and watched personalities on YouTube and Twitch ever, beating out even huge names like Kendrick Lamar and iShowSpeed in search traffic in 2025 alone. He started out as a World of Warcraft streamer and grew into a content creator known for gameplay, reactions, commentary, and epic community moments, with millions of followers across platforms.\n\nThis tribute music video I made features fun visuals from his streams and clips, as well as cameos from creators and personalities who’ve shown up around his community: Skyebrows, Tectone, Brandon Herrera, Elon Musk, JD Vance, Smug Alana, Kirsche, Hasan, Frogan and more — because what’s a legend without his crew and fanbase?\n\nI also analyze some of the lyrics, which are built in the spirit of Asmongold’s energy — his no-BS reactions, gaming passion, internet culture influence, and even the jokes his community often makes about him online (like reacting to memes and moments from his streams). Whether you know him for WoW content, his reaction videos, or even some of the drama he’s weathered, this piece is a fun tribute to everything that’s made him iconic.\n\nThis music video isn’t serious — it’s pure love, creativity, and appreciation for a streamer who’s become part of internet culture. If you enjoy people-powered content like this, hit Like, Subscribe, and ring so you don’t miss more creative tributes, reactions, and fun videos!

Ia memulai karirnya sebagai streamer World of Warcraft dan berkembang menjadi kreator konten yang dikenal karena gameplay, reaksi, komentar, dan momen komunitas yang epik, dengan jutaan pengikut di berbagai platform.\n\nVideo musik penghormatan yang saya buat ini menampilkan visual yang menyenangkan dari siaran dan klipnya, serta penampilan singkat dari kreator dan tokoh yang muncul di komunitasnya: Skyebrows, Tectone, Brandon Herrera, Elon Musk, JD Vance, Smug Alana, Kirsche, Hasan, Frogan, dan banyak lagi — karena apa artinya seorang legenda tanpa kru dan penggemarnya?\n\nSaya juga menganalisis beberapa liriknya, yang dibangun sesuai dengan semangat dan energi Asmongold — reaksinya yang tanpa basa-basi, gairahnya bermain game, pengaruhnya terhadap budaya internet, dan bahkan lelucon yang sering dibuat komunitasnya tentang dirinya secara online (seperti bereaksi terhadap meme dan momen dari siarannya). Baik Anda mengenalnya karena konten WoW, video reaksinya, atau bahkan beberapa drama yang telah ia lalui, karya ini adalah penghormatan yang menyenangkan untuk semua hal yang telah membuatnya ikonik.\n\nVideo musik ini tidak serius — ini murni cinta, kreativitas, dan apresiasi untuk seorang streamer yang telah menjadi bagian dari budaya internet. Jika Anda menikmati konten yang digerakkan oleh orang-orang seperti ini, tekan Suka, Berlangganan, dan aktifkan notifikasi agar Anda tidak ketinggalan lebih banyak penghormatan kreatif, reaksi, dan video menyenangkan! Komentar di bawah: Apa momen atau penampilan Asmongold favorit ANDA dalam video ini?\n\n\nVideo musik penghormatan Asmongold, lagu asli Leaflit, cameo penghormatan Asmongold, Skyebrows, cameo Tectone, penghormatan kreator game Asmongold, cameo Elon Musk JD Vance, Smug Alana, referensi Kirsche, momen ikonik Asmon, video penghormatan untuk Asmongold, video penghormatan Asmongold, video musik penghormatan, lagu asli Leaflit, mashup komunitas Asmongold, penghormatan budaya game, cameo tokoh internet, MV penghormatan, video musik, penghormatan legenda streamer, lagu penghormatan Asmongold, MV Leaflit, penghormatan kreator internet, momen klasik Asmon, video musik penuh cameo\n\nJika Anda adalah pemilik video asli dan ingin video ini dihapus, silakan hubungi: Julio@angelssword.com\n\n#gaming #vtuber #reaction"

Thanks Raycon for sponsoring!\n\nElden Ring is almost 4 years old, which still feels insane to say. Before this game launched, my life looked completely different and in a lot of ways, Elden Ring helped shape everything that came after. So today, we’re going back to where it all started. The earliest playable version of Elden Ring on PC.\nThis isn’t the polished game we know today. Pre-nerf weapons, broken mechanics, insane bugs, performance issues, and some absolutely cursed exploits like flying Torrent, crazy skips, and prime Sword of Night and Flame. If you played Elden Ring at launch, this will bring back memories. And if you didn’t? This is your chance to see just how different the game really was on day one. Enjoy!\n\nI Climb.\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxXKGdzo7jk4DxjTywCTew/join\n\nSTAY NOTIFIED - https://discord.gg/PKED9UFnXE\n\nGET SKUMNUT MERCH HERE - https://skumnut-shop.fourthwall.com\n\nMaidens got you thirsty?
