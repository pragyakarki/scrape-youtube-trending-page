            "description": "This week on Angie Martinez IRL Podcast, Angie is coming to you live from one of the most zen places on earth… Kim Kardashian’s office. Kim has a “big life” full of tons of opinions but has somehow mastered remaining calm mentally and emotionally despite it all. She admits she doesn’t look at comments, is open to self-correction, and believes in the room for redemption but reveals that the robbery in Paris is what really shifted her values in a major way. \n\nEveryone is going through something in real life, Kim Kardashian included. In this episode, Kim shares how the memories of her own father help her keep it together for her kids and continue to be what leads her in her very complex co-parenting journey.  \n\nDespite all that’s happening around her, she makes time where there is often none, is dedicated to helping others, and admits to truly feeling at peace. Kim Kardashian is free, having fun, and enjoying dating, even if it means various forms of dating in the house. \n\nThis is an episode you won’t want to miss. \n\nWebsite: https://www.angiemartinez.com \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/angiemartinez (Follow) \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/angiemartinez (Follow) \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/officialangiemartinez (Like)",

                "description": "This week on Angie Martinez IRL Podcast, Angie is coming to you live from one of the most zen places on earth… Kim Kardashian’s office. Kim has a “big life” full of tons of opinions but has somehow mastered remaining calm mentally and emotionally despite it all. She admits she doesn’t look at comments, is open to self-correction, and believes in the room for redemption but reveals that the robbery in Paris is what really shifted her values in a major way. \n\nEveryone is going through something in real life, Kim Kardashian included. In this episode, Kim shares how the memories of her own father help her keep it together for her kids and continue to be what leads her in her very complex co-parenting journey.  \n\nDespite all that’s happening around her, she makes time where there is often none, is dedicated to helping others, and admits to truly feeling at peace. Kim Kardashian is free, having fun, and enjoying dating, even if it means various forms of dating in the house. \n\nThis is an episode you won’t want to miss. \n\nWebsite: https://www.angiemartinez.com \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/angiemartinez (Follow) \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/angiemartinez (Follow) \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/officialangiemartinez (Like)"

It has a twin turbo V6 with 660 horsepower, lots of weight saving carbon fibre, and a rapidly-deploying suspension drop system along with an active rear wing that is as functional as it is dramatic. But how does it stack up against a 2023 Corvette C8 Z06 ($164,505 as specced in the US, $189,027 in Canada) which is but a fraction of the cost and has a high-revving naturally aspirated V8?

                "description": "Spine surgery has me stuck in bed, so I'm building the world's first YouTuber theme park and raising money for children with critical illnesses. Every $1 counts so thank you for clicking the donate button on this screen to help Make-A-Wish Foundation grant the wishes of these kids.\n\nI just had one of the eight spinal tumors removed from my back, so I can't do a whole lot while I recover from surgery. But, with the help of my wife, Vy Qwaint, I think we can build a pretty awesome indoor family entertainment center for everybody to enjoy. Inside the adventure park we plan on having a trampoline park, video game arcade, zip line, ropes course, ninja warrior training courses, escape rooms, axe throwing, free roam Virtual Reality VR, retro barcade, climbing walls, restaurant, birthday party rooms, and a ton more fun stuff to do here in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nWe're gonna need a lot more help to get this FEC built by my birthday on March 10th so we need to hire some help. Vy interviews Burt and attempts to interview a guy name James but it doesn't go so well. The last candidate, Anne, we brought over to interview from bed. It was pretty awkward but it was a good test to see if she can handle working with crazy YouTubers.\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube\n\nMost royalty free background music is from Epidemic Sounds.

Plus, enjoy limited holiday events with special Rare Capsule sets and seasonal stages on into the new year!\n\nend of year post. This was a longer video which is all thanks to Matt! You can tell he worked on the video because the animation was good lol. I'm working on building a team to be able to make more videos and Matt has been a huge help in that effort. I'm still learning how to build a team at all so there may be some growing pains but it's exciting that it's happening.\n\nAnyway this video is about an experience I had last summer. My friend invited me to go farm sit and that was a great and rare opportunity just plopped on my lap so I decided I really wanted to go. And so I did! There was a lot of new experiences gained from the trip, and in this video was the most notable ones. Italy is a beautiful place with really tasty food. I am certainly going back some day. Either as a farmer or a tourist who knows.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this video. More to come. \n\nanimators: https://twitter.com/Thelaserbearguy and me\n\nThank you for watching.\n\nMERCH IS HERE:\nhttps://icecreamsandwich.store/\n📱 twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\n📷 instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/"

Jesus Trejo (Tacos Con Todo) is taste-testing holiday foods from around the world with the kids of Common Threads! Alvin Cailan (The Burger Show), Nicole Russell (Pizza Wars), and George Motz (Burger Scholar Sessions) are whipping up holiday leftover sandwiches! The much-anticipated Hot Ones Awards with Camera Guy Bill!

            "description": "I’ve just disembarked what may be the shortest and weirdest cruise in history on a ship that was planned to be scrapped in 2020. She was saved from the scrapyard by a new British cruise line and I booked a 3 night mini break onboard the ship. \n \nOur cruise was cancelled 4 hours after we boarded and in total we were onboard this ship for about 8 hours, and during that time we had more problems than we would usually on a full two week cruise. The way that everything was handled was so bizarre I honestly think I’m still in shock. \n \nWe boarded the ship in London Tilbury and were planning on heading to Bruges to the Christmas markets. Embarkation was pretty easy and despite the bad weather we were really excited to get onboard. \n \nI picked up my cruise card which is the thing you use to get into your room, to buy drinks, pretty much everything onboard it’s very important. But my friends Justin and Tristan were told that they’d have to get theirs onboard as they weren’t ready yet, no big deal we thought, that isn’t uncommon on a cruise for things to be a bit delayed. The problem was much bigger than that but at this point we didn’t realise how widespread the problem was. \n \nAs soon as we embarked the ship we were in the middle of this beautiful Atrum, the ship was decorated for Christmas and looked amazing. Despite the ship being from 1991 everything here looked very new and I hoped that the rest of the ship would be as nice as this area. I didn’t have particularly high expectations after reading review after review online about broken toilets, broken air conditioning but this area definitely surpassed what I had expected. \n\nCruise Buoys Vlog: https://youtu.be/k8gPqPTbFgw\nSail Away With Dan and Jay Tour: https://youtu.be/XBCVVW75SGk\n \nOne of my favourite things about cruising is that feeling when you first get onboard a cruise ship and you run around exploring as fast as you can. Looking back I’m so glad that I did because I wouldn’t have a chance to later. We found a big pub area called The Purple Turtle which I’ve since found out used to be a casino. In the UK we don’t gamble as much as other places so if a British cruise line buys an American or Australian ship, they normally replace the big casino with one thats much smaller. \n \nThe ship was originally launched in 1991 for Princess cruises as Regal Princess and spent most of her life as Pacific Dawn for P&O Australia. As I was wandering around the main public areas I thought wow Ambassador have done a great job renovating these spaces, I’ve since had a look at P&O Dawn ship reviews and I think I should be giving a lot of the credit to P&O instead of Ambassador because most of the inside spaces haven’t changed, even the picture frames are the same in the big lounges. Not that that’s a bad thing, they didn’t need to be changed, P&O did a great job with these areas when they refit the ship back in 2017. \n\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to exclusive perks like a weekly podcast and early ad free access to videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu4C8c3h9SKdkxnOwIAiHeA/join\n\n▶ Weekly Updates: http://EmmaCruises.com/News\n▶ Book a Cruise: https://EmmaCruises.com/Book-a-Cruise/\n\nLet’s Connect! \n▶ https://EmmaCruises.com/SocialLinks\n\n*** \n▶  Background World Map: https://emmacruises.com/map (Affiliate link)\n\nemma@emmacruises.com",
