Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black).

            "description": "Ashley Pointer | February 28, 2025\nThe morning that Bishop Marvin Sapp came to NPR, he told me that it was his kids who really emphasized how important it was for him to accept our invitation to perform: \"They told me, 'Dad, Tiny Desk is for the culture.' \"\n\nBacked by a four-piece band and a six-piece choir, Sapp transforms our office into a sanctuary, performing an 11-song medley of praise and worship hits that span more than three decades in music and ministry. From the moment his set begins, the spirit moves through the room, filling every corner with raw emotion, joy and reverence.\n\nFrom Sapp's early days with the trailblazing '90s gospel group Commissioned to penning anthems like \"Never Would Have Made It\" — a song that transcends church walls — his impact is woven into the fabric of Black culture. \"What's funny is, I saw some of y'all singing these songs, and y'all weren't even born when I recorded them,\" Sapp jokes, underscoring his intergenerational influence. Yet, despite his legendary status, Sapp took time after the performance to speak and pray with members of our audience, choosing ministry first, above all else.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I Believe\"\n\"Not the Time, Not the Place\"\n\"Grace and Mercy\"\n\"Perfect Peace\"\n\"Shout Unto God\"\n\"Here I Am\"\n\"Praise Him in Advance\"\n\"You Are God Alone\"\n\"He Has His Hands on You\"\n\"My Testimony\"\n\"The Best in Me\"\n\"Never Would Have Made It\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBishop Marvin Sapp: vocals\nCurtis Lindsey: keys, music director\nThaddeus Johnson: bass\nTavarius \"Varo\" Johnson: drums\nSam Mitchem: guitar\nChristina Michelle: background vocals\nGus Lacy: background vocals\nShaki Wilson: background vocals\nJarmone: background vocals\nA.

                "title": "Marvin Sapp: Tiny Desk Concert",
                "description": "Ashley Pointer | February 28, 2025\nThe morning that Bishop Marvin Sapp came to NPR, he told me that it was his kids who really emphasized how important it was for him to accept our invitation to perform: \"They told me, 'Dad, Tiny Desk is for the culture.' \"\n\nBacked by a four-piece band and a six-piece choir, Sapp transforms our office into a sanctuary, performing an 11-song medley of praise and worship hits that span more than three decades in music and ministry. From the moment his set begins, the spirit moves through the room, filling every corner with raw emotion, joy and reverence.\n\nFrom Sapp's early days with the trailblazing '90s gospel group Commissioned to penning anthems like \"Never Would Have Made It\" — a song that transcends church walls — his impact is woven into the fabric of Black culture. \"What's funny is, I saw some of y'all singing these songs, and y'all weren't even born when I recorded them,\" Sapp jokes, underscoring his intergenerational influence. Yet, despite his legendary status, Sapp took time after the performance to speak and pray with members of our audience, choosing ministry first, above all else.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I Believe\"\n\"Not the Time, Not the Place\"\n\"Grace and Mercy\"\n\"Perfect Peace\"\n\"Shout Unto God\"\n\"Here I Am\"\n\"Praise Him in Advance\"\n\"You Are God Alone\"\n\"He Has His Hands on You\"\n\"My Testimony\"\n\"The Best in Me\"\n\"Never Would Have Made It\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBishop Marvin Sapp: vocals\nCurtis Lindsey: keys, music director\nThaddeus Johnson: bass\nTavarius \"Varo\" Johnson: drums\nSam Mitchem: guitar\nChristina Michelle: background vocals\nGus Lacy: background vocals\nShaki Wilson: background vocals\nJarmone: background vocals\nA.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson",

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n►https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ ►https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n►https://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n►https://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson"

In this video, we unbox the new engine, bolt on the bell housing and transmission, and move the rear frame into position. Using the overhead crane, Kurtis carefully lowers the engine into place, but as expected, the existing mounts and saddle are in the way. Since we planned for this, we get all the measurements to design and 3D draw new parts before getting straight to work air arc gouging off the old mounts and saddle to make way for the new setup. While we’re at it, we also remove the rust-damaged plate in the articulation joint. With everything prepped and ground back, the engine bay and rear frame are now ready for the next stage of fabrication!\n\nIf you love heavy machinery rebuilds, fabrication, and machining, LIKE, SUBSCRIBE, and turn on NOTIFICATIONS so you don’t miss the next episode!\n\nWatch the full Franna Crane Project series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUzFN5xVei7UatVhlxlw3576rgwg2RTXf\n\nJoin our channel:\nWe upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!

            "description": "For the first time, Kevin Franke and his son Chad Franke, 20, are breaking their silence on the shocking child abuse scandal surrounding Ruby Franke and her controversial therapist, Jodi Hildebrandt. Kevin and Chad open up about the dark reality behind their once-popular YouTube channel, 8 Passengers, and how their lives were shattered by manipulation, abuse, and extreme parenting tactics.\n\nAt the peak of their fame, the Franke family had 2.5 million subscribers and earned $100,000 per month, but behind the scenes, a disturbing truth was unfolding. Ruby Franke’s extreme discipline methods—promoted by Hildebrandt—led to the eventual arrest and conviction of both women for felony child abuse, resulting in prison sentences of up to 30 years each in 2024.\n\nKevin Franke, who admits to feelings of guilt and regret, says much of the physical abuse was kept from him—especially during the year Ruby forced him to live apart from the family. He is now estranged from Ruby and filed for divorce in November 2023.\n\nThe family is telling their side of the story and reflecting on how they are rebuilding their lives after the horrific abuse that left them deeply traumatized. “I really hope [my mom] becomes a better person and truly tries to change,”says Chad, who currently has no contact with his mother. Watch the new Hulu docuseries, 'Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke', streaming February 27, for more on this story.\n\n* If you suspect child abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or 1-800-422-4453, or go to www.childhelp.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential. The hotline is available 24/7 in more than 170 languages. \n\nSubscribe to People ►► http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.

Ruby Franke’s extreme discipline methods—promoted by Hildebrandt—led to the eventual arrest and conviction of both women for felony child abuse, resulting in prison sentences of up to 30 years each in 2024.\n\nKevin Franke, who admits to feelings of guilt and regret, says much of the physical abuse was kept from him—especially during the year Ruby forced him to live apart from the family. He is now estranged from Ruby and filed for divorce in November 2023.\n\nThe family is telling their side of the story and reflecting on how they are rebuilding their lives after the horrific abuse that left them deeply traumatized. “I really hope [my mom] becomes a better person and truly tries to change,”says Chad, who currently has no contact with his mother. Watch the new Hulu docuseries, 'Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke', streaming February 27, for more on this story.\n\n* If you suspect child abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or 1-800-422-4453, or go to www.childhelp.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential. The hotline is available 24/7 in more than 170 languages. \n\nSubscribe to People ►► http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.

Led by Keenen Ivory Wayans, creator of In Living Color, they broke barriers in film, TV, and stand-up comedy, launching the careers of stars like Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx, and Jennifer Lopez. With a fearless approach to storytelling, Keenen and his siblings—Damon, Marlon, Shawn, and Kim—have created iconic works like Scary Movie, White Chicks, and The Wayans Bros. The next generation, including Damon Wayans Jr., is continuing the legacy, with Marlon starring in Respect and Air, and the family gearing up for a Scary Movie reboot in 2026.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to #BET! ►► http://bit.ly/1U0v9xG\n\nStream Black Culture with BET+.

But which will come out on top? Let’s take a closer look at the stats. \n\nStarting with the Bugatti, it’s the Chiron Super Sport, which comes with an 8-litre quad-turbo W16 that produces 1600hp and 1600Nm of torque. This power is sent to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, and the car weighs 1,995kg. Following several interior & exterior modifications, the car we have here is valued at £5,000,000.\n\nAlongside it, we have the Koenigsegg Jesko Attack. This is powered by a 5-litre twin-turbo V8, and this creates 1280hp and 1000Nm. This power is sent to the rear wheels only via a 9-speed multi-clutch gearbox, and it weighs a whole lot less than the Bugatti, tipping the scales at just 1,420kg! But just like the Chiron Super Sport, it has a price tag of £5,000,000. \n\nSo the Bugatti is well up on power, but it weighs half a tonne more than the Koenigsegg! Could the weight difference prove decisive?

Wir können es kaum erwarten, in den kommenden Monaten (und Jahren) mehr Inhalte für euch zu erstellen – als Nächstes 2 Videos, die wir in Malaysia gedreht haben!! \n\nHALLO FREUNDE und willkommen zu einem weiteren Video!! Diese Woche zeigen wir euch die Einzelheiten unseres gesamten Renovierungsprozesses für unser neues Studio/Büro!! Wir sind die letzten (8) Jahre planlos wie aufgescheuchte Hühner herumgerannt – und so haben wir endlich beschlossen, dass es an der Zeit ist, zu versuchen, unser Traumstudio/Büro zu bauen. Und weil wir große Fans von Renovierungsinhalten im HGTV-Stil sind, haben wir beschlossen, ein altes Lagerhaus von oben bis unten zu renovieren und den gesamten Prozess (auch von oben bis unten) zu dokumentieren.

This week we are going to be showing you guys the ins ands outs of our entire renovation process for our new studio/office!! We have been haphazardly running around like chickens with our heads cut off for the last (8) years - and so we finally decided it was time to attempt to make our dream studio/office. And because we are huge fans of HGTV-style renovation content, we decided to renovate an old warehouse from top to bottom and document the entire process (also top to bottom).

            "description": "The Chosen Season 5 in theaters March 28\n---\nI think I'm more excited to deliver this trailer than any we've done. Which isn't a coincidence because I feel the same way about Season Five as a whole. This is our most kick-butt content yet because we cover joy, pain, loyalty, betrayal, excitement, anger, sadness, and fear, sometimes within one episode.\n\nIt’s Holy Week, the most impactful and famous week in human history. Jerusalem is a powder keg with all of Jesus’ followers, enemies, and over a million Passover pilgrims packed into one small place. He shows sides of Himself we’ve never seen till now—turning over tables, literally cracking the whip, and weeping with heartbreak but also love. He also confuses His followers at every turn...and to what end?\n\nThe takeaway for you from this season: Can you believe and follow even when you don't understand?\n\nYes, it’s sad and heartbreaking because we’re getting closer to the cross, but we’re also going to get to see some of the most iconic and deeply moving moments from Scripture. The triumphal entry, the turning of the tables, the betrayal by Judas, and the Last Supper...all set against the biggest backdrop and sets we've ever used with a new widescreen format that demands to be seen on the big screen. But of course, we continue our obsession to humanize and authenticate everyone involved.\n\nThe table is set.

            "description": "Bobby Carter | February 20, 2025\nOn the morning of Leon Thomas' Tiny Desk concert, many NPR staffers assumed the show was postponed due to a snowstorm in the D.C. area. Not only did he proactively schedule his coast-to-coast flight but he was also 30 minutes early to the office. With his sophomore album, MUTT, Thomas has planted his flag as the most exciting artist in R&B music today. The Tiny Desk had to happen now; nothing would get in the way of divine timing.\n\nThomas was destined to be an entertainer — he's been doing it for most of his life. His parents were both musicians and introduced him to their world early on. As an actor, he appeared in multiple Broadway plays before becoming a staple on the Nickelodeon network. Under the tutelage of Babyface, he earned his chops as a writer and producer, eventually penning and producing big hits in R&B and hip-hop.\n\nHe opens this set with three songs from MUTT and closes with two from 2023's Electric Dusk, including \"Breaking Point,\" which he dedicates to his recently deceased grandfather, the opera singer John Anthony: \"This is one of his favorite songs.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"VIBES DON'T LIE\"\n\"YES IT IS\"\n\"MUTT\"\n\"Breaking Point\" \n\"Treasure In The Hills\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLeon Thomas: vocals, guitar\nChris Payton: guitar\nAli Roots: keys, piano\nJoe \"Jough\" Cleveland: bass\nQuintin \"Q\" Gulledge: drums\nTK: background vocals\nAyana Layli: background vocals\nSha'Leah Nikole: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Grace Raver\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #leonthomas",
