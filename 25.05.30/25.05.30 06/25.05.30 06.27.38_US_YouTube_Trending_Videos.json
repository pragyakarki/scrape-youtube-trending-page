Congratulations to Team Beast (@MrBeast, @MarkRober, @chandlerhallow, @StokesTwins, @rug, @Mar3LG, @NickNayersina, and @DVontayFriga) on winning verses Team Fede (@fedevigevani, @IbaiLlanos, @Fernanfloo, @JuegaGerman, @thatkidelvis, @RickyLimon, and @EladioCarrion).\n\n📱 FOLLOW MY SOCIALS 📱\n➽ Instagram - @MatthewBeem\n➽ Twitter - @MatthewBeem\n➽ TikTok - @MatthewBeem\n\nI’ve built secret gaming rooms to hide from my mom, my dad, my sister—even the police—but this time, I took it to a whole new level. MrBeast asked me to build a trophy for his massive YouTuber basketball tournament, but what he didn’t know is that I secretly built a hidden gaming room inside the trophy itself. And that’s not all. My friend Airrack had a bet to sneak into MrBeast’s warehouse without being caught… so we teamed up to make it happen.\n\nWith the help of my friends and Govee’s insane RGB lighting, we built one of the most over-the-top secret rooms ever—right under the nose of MrBeast’s team, security cameras, and millions of livestream viewers. You can also see the other side of this story in Airrack’s video: “I Hid in Famous YouTuber’s Videos… No One Noticed.” \n\nThis build had everything—stealth missions, disguises, 11-foot trophies, and a hidden room that lit up like a spaceship. The craziest part? MrBeast, Mark Rober, FaZe Rug, and a bunch of the biggest YouTubers on the planet were all just feet away with no idea what was really going on.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one!\nComment “I want a secret room!” so I can notice you.\n\nNot I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From The Police, But I Built a SECRET Free Store For Mr Beast, But I Built 5 SECRET Rooms You’d Never Find, But I Built a SECRET Bunk Bed in My Room, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room In School, But \nUnited States VS Spanish Creators!, But HABLA HISPANA VS ESTADOS UNIDOS 🏀, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Sister, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But I Hid in Famous YouTuber’s Videos… No One Noticed, But I Built a SECRET Room For MrBeast, But I Built a SECRET Pool in My Room, But I Spent 7 Days In Solitary Confinement or any other video like Topper Guild, MrBeast, Zhong, Fede Vigevani, Ben Azelart, thatkidelvis, Fernanfloo, Eladio Carrion, Marlon, Nick Nayersina, Ibai, Chandler Hallow, Mark Rober, Fede Vigevani, Stokes Twins, MrBeast, Ricky Limon, D'Vontay Friga, JuegaGerman, FaZe Rug or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) built a secret gaming room inside of MrBeast’s warehouse to hid Airrack during Fede’s YouTuber basketball tournament!",

MrBeast asked me to build a trophy for his massive YouTuber basketball tournament, but what he didn’t know is that I secretly built a hidden gaming room inside the trophy itself. And that’s not all. My friend Airrack had a bet to sneak into MrBeast’s warehouse without being caught… so we teamed up to make it happen.\n\nWith the help of my friends and Govee’s insane RGB lighting, we built one of the most over-the-top secret rooms ever—right under the nose of MrBeast’s team, security cameras, and millions of livestream viewers. You can also see the other side of this story in Airrack’s video: “I Hid in Famous YouTuber’s Videos… No One Noticed.” \n\nThis build had everything—stealth missions, disguises, 11-foot trophies, and a hidden room that lit up like a spaceship. The craziest part? MrBeast, Mark Rober, FaZe Rug, and a bunch of the biggest YouTubers on the planet were all just feet away with no idea what was really going on.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one!\nComment “I want a secret room!” so I can notice you.\n\nNot I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From The Police, But I Built a SECRET Free Store For Mr Beast, But I Built 5 SECRET Rooms You’d Never Find, But I Built a SECRET Bunk Bed in My Room, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room In School, But \nUnited States VS Spanish Creators!, But HABLA HISPANA VS ESTADOS UNIDOS 🏀, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Sister, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But I Hid in Famous YouTuber’s Videos… No One Noticed, But I Built a SECRET Room For MrBeast, But I Built a SECRET Pool in My Room, But I Spent 7 Days In Solitary Confinement or any other video like Topper Guild, MrBeast, Zhong, Fede Vigevani, Ben Azelart, thatkidelvis, Fernanfloo, Eladio Carrion, Marlon, Nick Nayersina, Ibai, Chandler Hallow, Mark Rober, Fede Vigevani, Stokes Twins, MrBeast, Ricky Limon, D'Vontay Friga, JuegaGerman, FaZe Rug or Airrack would make.

Você também pode ver o outro lado dessa história no vídeo do Airrack: \"Eu me escondi em vídeos de YouTubers famosos... Ninguém percebeu\".\n\nEsta construção tinha tudo: missões furtivas, disfarces, troféus de 3,3 metros e uma sala escondida que iluminava como uma nave espacial. A parte mais maluca?

            "description": "After 28,000 engine failures, GM is recommending thicker oil. Will it work?\nDo Thin Oils Damage Engines - https://youtu.be/IKdhgKUZhPA\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\n\nAfter over 28,000 reported engine failures, GM is recommending thicker oil as a potential solution — but is that really the answer? In this video, we take a deep dive into why so many GM 6.2L V8 (L87) engines are failing, what the actual root causes are, and why a simple oil change is being offered as a fix in some cases.\n\nWe’ll explore:\n1. The manufacturing flaws behind these widespread failures.\n2. How oil viscosity and the Stribeck Curve relate to engine wear.\n3. Whether thinner oils are causing damage in modern engines.\n4. If switching to a thicker oil could actually help protect your engine.\n\nThis isn’t just opinion — we’re digging into the data, published research, and real-world test results to understand the logic behind GM’s service bulletins and what it means for both affected vehicles and the broader debate around oil viscosity. If you’re curious about the science behind engine lubrication, the role of modern manufacturing, or just want to understand what oil you should be using, this video is for you.\n\nRelated Videos:\nDo Thin Oils Damage Engines - https://youtu.be/IKdhgKUZhPA\nGM Engine Recall Motor Oil Geek - https://youtu.be/pbEdr6Q6cKw\n\nReferences:\nNHTSA Recall Report - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCLRPT-25V274-1598.PDF\nGM Recall Details - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCRIT-25V274-6343.pdf\nGM Recall Details 2 - https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2025/RCRIT-25V274-5347.pdf\nHonda Oil Study (1999) -  https://doi.org/10.4271/1999-01-3468\nHonda Oil Study (2011) - https://doi.org/10.4271/2011-01-1247\nToyota Oil Study (2020) -  https://doi.org/10.4271/2020-01-1425\nLow Viscosity No Fuel Econ Improvement - https://doi.org/10.4271/2019-01-2241\nCorvette Track Prep - https://www.chevrolet.com/content/dam/chevrolet/na/us/english/index/vehicles/2020/performance/corvette-experience/02-pdf/02-pdf/2023%20Corvette%20Track%20Preparation%20Form_081722_v5.pdf\nStribeck Curve - https://profile.iitd.ac.in/~hirani/lec13.pdf\nSilverado Most Dependable - https://www.chevrolet.com/trucks/previous-year/silverado/1500\nJD Power Awards - https://www.jdpower.com/business/awards\n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\nRecommended Books & Car Products - http://amzn.to/2BrekJm\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA",

Will it work?\nDo Thin Oils Damage Engines - https://youtu.be/IKdhgKUZhPA\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\n\nAfter over 28,000 reported engine failures, GM is recommending thicker oil as a potential solution — but is that really the answer? In this video, we take a deep dive into why so many GM 6.2L V8 (L87) engines are failing, what the actual root causes are, and why a simple oil change is being offered as a fix in some cases.\n\nWe’ll explore:\n1. The manufacturing flaws behind these widespread failures.\n2. How oil viscosity and the Stribeck Curve relate to engine wear.\n3. Whether thinner oils are causing damage in modern engines.\n4. If switching to a thicker oil could actually help protect your engine.\n\nThis isn’t just opinion — we’re digging into the data, published research, and real-world test results to understand the logic behind GM’s service bulletins and what it means for both affected vehicles and the broader debate around oil viscosity.

Wait till you have a son\n\nSo why love anything, anything, anything at all?\nWhy love anything at all?\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\nThen why love anything at all?\n\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nAnything at all?\nAnything at all?\n\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\nThen why love anything, anything, anything at all?\nWhy love anything at all?\n\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\nWhy love\n(Why love)\nAnything at all?\n\n...........................................................\n\n\nCREW\n\nDirector/DP - Alex Palumbo https://www.instagram.com/alxpalumbo/\n\nExecutive Producer - Louis Coppola https://www.instagram.com/louis_coppola_/\n\nProducer- Cabell Moskal https://www.instagram.com/cabellmoskal/\n\n\nGaffer -  Jason Wain https://www.instagram.com/jasonwain/\n\nKey Grip - Jacob Anderson https://www.instagram.com/jayrobande/\n\nGrip - Wyatt Scruggs https://www.instagram.com/scruggswyatt/\n\nEdit - Alex Palumbo \n\nEdit - Jimmy Regular https://www.instagram.com/jimmyregular/\n\nColor - Alex Palumbo \n\nStudio Engineer - Dan Davis https://www.instagram.com/_danjosbanjo/\n\nStudio Engineer - Hank Bachara https://www.instagram.com/hank_iii/\n\nStudio - Southern Ground Nashville https://www.instagram.com/southerngroundnashville_/\n\n \n\nBAND\n\nGuitar - Kurt Ozan https://www.instagram.com/kurtozan251/\n\nDrums - Jake Sommers https://www.instagram.com/jakesommers7/\n\nKeys - Korey Hunt https://www.instagram.com/koreyhuntmusic/\n\nBass - Mat Maxwell https://www.instagram.com/mathewmaxwell/",

Luke Combs OUT NOW\n\nhttps://jonbellion.lnk.to/2Fe0Kg\nbeautifulmind.club\n\nWHY Lyrics \n\n(Jon)\nI’m scared to meet you,\n‘cause then I might know you\nAnd then once I know you, I might fall in love\nAnd once I’m in love, then my heart is wide open\nFor you to walk in, drop a bomb, blow it up\n\nSo why love anything, anything, anything at all?\nWhy love anything at all?\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\nThen why love anything at all?\n\n(Luke)\nStressed and strung out about things that could happen\nAnd I could move mountains with worry I’ve done\nSo I call my father and he started laughing\nHe said you think it’s bad now? Wait till you have a son\n\nSo why love anything, anything, anything at all?\nWhy love anything at all?\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\nThen why love anything at all?\n\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nWhy love?\nAnything at all?\nAnything at all?\n\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\nThen why love anything, anything, anything at all?\nWhy love anything at all?\n\nIf the higher I fly is the further I fall\nWhy love\n(Why love)\nAnything at all?\n\n...........................................................\n\n\nCREW\n\nDirector/DP - Alex Palumbo https://www.instagram.com/alxpalumbo/\n\nExecutive Producer - Louis Coppola https://www.instagram.com/louis_coppola_/\n\nProducer- Cabell Moskal https://www.instagram.com/cabellmoskal/\n\n\nGaffer -  Jason Wain https://www.instagram.com/jasonwain/\n\nKey Grip - Jacob Anderson https://www.instagram.com/jayrobande/\n\nGrip - Wyatt Scruggs https://www.instagram.com/scruggswyatt/\n\nEdit - Alex Palumbo \n\nEdit - Jimmy Regular https://www.instagram.com/jimmyregular/\n\nColor - Alex Palumbo \n\nStudio Engineer - Dan Davis https://www.instagram.com/_danjosbanjo/\n\nStudio Engineer - Hank Bachara https://www.instagram.com/hank_iii/\n\nStudio - Southern Ground Nashville https://www.instagram.com/southerngroundnashville_/\n\n \n\nBAND\n\nGuitar - Kurt Ozan https://www.instagram.com/kurtozan251/\n\nDrums - Jake Sommers https://www.instagram.com/jakesommers7/\n\nKeys - Korey Hunt https://www.instagram.com/koreyhuntmusic/\n\nBass - Mat Maxwell https://www.instagram.com/mathewmaxwell/"
