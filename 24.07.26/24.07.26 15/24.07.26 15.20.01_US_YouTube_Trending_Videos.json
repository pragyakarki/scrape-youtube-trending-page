            "description": "Wow, the new Corvette ZR1 is quite something. For a start, one thousand and sixty-four horsepower is nothing short of A LOT. In fact, it’s nearly 400 more than the Corvette Z06, and higher than the likes of the Ferrari SF90 XX, let alone hybrid-assisted hypercars such as the McLaren P1, LaFerrari and Porsche 918.\n\nAnd yet, all that power comes from a solitary 5.5-litre, twin-turbocharged V8, with not a jot of a hybrid system in sight.

            "description": "When you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you. Joker: Folie À Deux – only in theaters and IMAX, October 4. #JokerMovie #FilmedForIMAX \n\nFrom acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes “Joker: Folie À Deux,” the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Academy Award-winning “Joker,” which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.  The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar winner Lady Gaga (“A Star Is Born”).\n\n“Joker: Folie À Deux” finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (“The Banshees of Inisherin”) and Catherine Keener (“Get Out,” “Capote”), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from “Joker.”\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing “Joker,” directed “Joker: Folie À Deux” from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC.  The film was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner.  Lady Gaga served as music consultant.  The film’s executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg and Jason Ruder.\n\nWorking with Phillips behind the camera are his team from “Joker,” including Oscar-nominated director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberg, Oscar-nominated editor Jeff Groth, and composer Hildur Guđnadóttir, who won the Oscar for her work on the first film.  New to the team is Oscar-nominated costume designer Arianne Phillips (“Once Upon a Time in… Hollywood,” “Don’t Worry Darling”).  Ruder is the film’s executive music producer and the music supervisors are Randall Poster and George Drakoulias.  Casting is by Francine Maisler (the “Dune” films, “Challengers”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents A Joint Effort Production, A Film by Todd Phillips, “Joker: Folie À Deux.”  The film will be released worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, and will be only in theaters nationwide on October 4, 2024, and beginning internationally on 2 October, 2024.",

Cada um tem seu próprio motivo para perseguir as criaturas imundas que agora habitam os campos de petróleo e as minas abandonadas.\n\nOutrora uma paisagem de florestas verdejantes e penhascos rochosos, o Vale de Mamon agora imita seus habitantes, fétido e podre, que logo será o último palco de derramamento de sangue e batalhas.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nObtenha o Hunt Showdown na Steam: https://tinyurl.com/HuntSteamYouTube\n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/huntshowdown\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/huntshowdown\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/crytek\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@huntshowdownofficial\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/huntshowdown\n\n#HuntShowdown #Hunt"

У каждого из них своя причина охотиться на мерзких тварей, которые теперь населяют нефтяные поля и заброшенные шахты.\n\nНекогда здесь была зеленая местность с лесами и скалистыми утесами, но теперь Распадок Маммоны куда более похож на своих обитателей — зловещих и гнилых. Скоро это место станет новой сценой кровопролитных сражений.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nПолучайте Hunt: Showdown в Steam: https://tinyurl.com/HuntSteamYouTube\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/joinchat/ecRnbpKV4rQ0MGEy\nVK: https://vk.com/huntshowdownofficial\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/huntshowdown\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/huntshowdown\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/crytek\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@huntshowdownofficial\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/huntshowdown\n\n#HuntShowdown #Hunt #gaming"

Tengo una historia de construcción de los mejores proyectos de Bob Esponja en YouTube, incluyendo cuando construí la casa de Bob Esponja en mi patio trasero, cuando construí Fondo de Bikini en mi patio trasero, cuando construí el vagón de Bob Esponja Patty, cuando construí el cubo de Bob Esponja Chum y cuando mis amigos y yo sobrevivimos 24 horas en Fondo de Bikini.  Así que me emocioné muchísimo cuando Nickelodeon me pidió que construyera la estatua de Bob Esponja más grande del mundo para celebrar el 25 aniversario de Bob Esponja en los Kid's Choice Awards. Esta construcción ha sido una de las más difíciles que he hecho, pero no podría estar más contento con el resultado. A todos los asistentes a los Kid's Choice Awards les encantó.Esta construcción ha sido una de las más difíciles que he hecho, pero no podría estar más contento con el resultado. A todos los asistentes a los Kid's Choice Awards les encantó. Incluso pude cumplir mi sueño de conocer a los actores de doblaje de Bob Esponja y Arenita, Tom Kenny y Carolyn Lawrence. Fue un vídeo muy nostálgico y nos reímos mucho.

            "description": "#eastidahonews #yellowstone #explosion \n\nYELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK -- Biscuit Basin at Yellowstone National Park is temporarily closed following a massive explosion that was caught on camera Tuesday morning.\n\nThe \"localized hydrothermal explosion\" occurred near Sapphire Pool around 10:20 a.m., according to a news release from the park. Video on social media shows a large amount of black and white water shooting into the air at the geyser. The explosion appears to have originated near Black Diamond Pool, the park says.\n\nNobody was injured in the explosion and boardwalks in the area were significantly damaged. They, along with the parking lot at Biscuit Basin, are closed for safety reasons. \n\nThe basin is named for the unusual biscuit-like deposits that used to surround Sapphire Pool, according to the park's website. Following the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake, Sapphire Pool erupted, and the “biscuits” were blown away. It last erupted in 1991.\n\n\"Hydrothermal explosions occur when water suddenly flashes to steam underground, and they are relatively common in Yellowstone,\" the news release says. \"For example, Porkchop Geyser, in Norris Geyser Basin, experienced an explosion in 1989, and a small event in Norris Geyser Basin was recorded by monitoring equipment on Apr. 15, 2024. An explosion similar to that of today also occurred in Biscuit Basin on May 17, 2009.\"\n\nPark staff and the USGS is monitoring conditions and reopen the area once deemed safe, the news release says.\n\n\"Monitoring data show no changes in the Yellowstone region. Today’s explosion does not reflect activity within volcanic system, which remains at normal background levels of activity,\" the release says. \"Hydrothermal explosions like that of today are not a sign of impending volcanic eruptions, and they are not caused by magma rising towards the surface.\"\n\nEastIdahoNews.com will post updates as we learn more.",

Since rebranding as Meta in 2021, the trillion-dollar company, formerly known as Facebook, has been pouring billions into its long term bets on artificial intelligence and the metaverse. Meta’s latest push is a major play to open-source AI, in contrast to Google and Open AI. In an exclusive interview, Bloomberg’s Emily Chang sits down with Zuckerberg to discuss how the company’s newest AI model Llama 3.1 will shape the future of business, technology and society. She also visits his retreat in Lake Tahoe to talk about his personal evolution as a leader, and learns how to wake surf with Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.\n\n#ai #meta #markzuckerberg \n--------\nLike this video?
