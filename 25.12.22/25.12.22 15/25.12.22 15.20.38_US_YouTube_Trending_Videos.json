Dies ist ein Speedrun / Minecraft Speedrunner gegen einen Killer/Assassinen.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\nMusik ist von: ​⁠ @DreamProductions​⁠\n\n#MinecraftManhunt"

As Doom systematically targets symbols that anchor this world—including Steve Rogers—the Avengers are forced into their most precarious fight yet, confronting a threat that seeks not to conquer their universe, but to overwrite it entirely.

Reed Richards uncovers the scale of Doom’s operation, Strange warns of a multiverse being rebuilt in Doom’s image, and looming fractures push heroes and allies into uneasy alliances. With realities collapsing and Doom’s perfect world nearing completion, the Avengers must challenge not just an adversary, but the very rewriting of existence itself.\n\n—  Subscribe to Teaser Universe 🎬\n—  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com 📩\n\n#marvel #robertdowneyjr #doomsday",

            "description": "💻 Visit https://lumalabs.ai/filmspeak to try Ray 3 Modify!\n🎬 In this FilmSpeak video essay we discuss why the Avengers Doomsday trailer is bleak and points to the creatively bankrupt state of the MCU with the return of Chris Evans' Steve Rogers.\n🔔 SUBSCRIBE: https://youtube.com/filmspeak?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThe Avengers: Doomsday trailer is here — and it says a lot about the current state of the MCU… none of it good.\n\nIn this video, we break down why the Avengers: Doomsday trailer feels less like a bold new chapter and more like a desperate course correction. With Marvel bringing back Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, a character whose arc was definitively concluded in Avengers: Endgame, the film signals just how heavily the Marvel Cinematic Universe is leaning on nostalgia to stay afloat.\n\nSix years after Endgame, Marvel finds itself unable to generate excitement around new heroes, new teams, or new long-term storylines — forcing the studio to retreat into legacy characters and familiar emotional beats. Instead of building toward the future, Avengers: Doomsday plays like a legacy sequel designed to remind audiences why they once cared.\n\nWe explore how Marvel’s post-Endgame missteps led to this moment, why nostalgia has become the franchise’s primary storytelling tool, and what this trailer reveals about the creative and structural problems plaguing the MCU. Is Avengers: Doomsday a meaningful culmination… or proof that Marvel has run out of new ideas?\n\nGriffin (@griffschiller) gives you his Avengers Doomsday trailer reaction, Avengers Doomsday trailer breakdown, theories on Steve Rogers' hotly anticipated return to the Marvel and the MCU, and more about why Avengers Doomsday already sounds like it will suck.\n\n#avengersdoomsday #avengersdoomsdaytrailer #videoessay #steverogers #chrisevans #captainamerica #marvel #mcu #comic #film #analysis #doctordoom #robertdowneyjr #thor #avengers #podcast \n\nEdited by @ThatOneDoesntCount \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAlhR6RxXQux2LWok1cIL6w/join\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n🎞 Chapters 🎞\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n🎞 About Avengers: Doomsday 🎞\n\nDirected by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Michael Waldron and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Chris Hemsworth, Vanessa Kirby, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Letitia Wright, Paul Rudd, Wyatt Russell, Tenoch Huerta Mejía, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Simu Liu, Florence Pugh, Kelsey Grammer, Lewis Pullman, Danny Ramirez, Joseph Quinn, David Harbour, Winston Duke, Hannah John-Kamen, Tom Hiddleston, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, and Robert Downey Jr. In the film, the Avengers, Wakandans, Fantastic Four, New Avengers, and the X-Men team up to face Doctor Doom (Downey).\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n▶️ About FilmSpeak ◀️\n\nWelcome to FilmSpeak hosted by Griffin Schiller, where the conversation continues after the credits.

With Marvel bringing back Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, a character whose arc was definitively concluded in Avengers: Endgame, the film signals just how heavily the Marvel Cinematic Universe is leaning on nostalgia to stay afloat.\n\nSix years after Endgame, Marvel finds itself unable to generate excitement around new heroes, new teams, or new long-term storylines — forcing the studio to retreat into legacy characters and familiar emotional beats. Instead of building toward the future, Avengers: Doomsday plays like a legacy sequel designed to remind audiences why they once cared.\n\nWe explore how Marvel’s post-Endgame missteps led to this moment, why nostalgia has become the franchise’s primary storytelling tool, and what this trailer reveals about the creative and structural problems plaguing the MCU. Is Avengers: Doomsday a meaningful culmination… or proof that Marvel has run out of new ideas?\n\nGriffin (@griffschiller) gives you his Avengers Doomsday trailer reaction, Avengers Doomsday trailer breakdown, theories on Steve Rogers' hotly anticipated return to the Marvel and the MCU, and more about why Avengers Doomsday already sounds like it will suck.\n\n#avengersdoomsday #avengersdoomsdaytrailer #videoessay #steverogers #chrisevans #captainamerica #marvel #mcu #comic #film #analysis #doctordoom #robertdowneyjr #thor #avengers #podcast \n\nEdited by @ThatOneDoesntCount \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAlhR6RxXQux2LWok1cIL6w/join\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n🎞 Chapters 🎞\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n🎞 About Avengers: Doomsday 🎞\n\nDirected by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Michael Waldron and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Chris Hemsworth, Vanessa Kirby, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Letitia Wright, Paul Rudd, Wyatt Russell, Tenoch Huerta Mejía, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Simu Liu, Florence Pugh, Kelsey Grammer, Lewis Pullman, Danny Ramirez, Joseph Quinn, David Harbour, Winston Duke, Hannah John-Kamen, Tom Hiddleston, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, and Robert Downey Jr. In the film, the Avengers, Wakandans, Fantastic Four, New Avengers, and the X-Men team up to face Doctor Doom (Downey).\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n▶️ About FilmSpeak ◀️\n\nWelcome to FilmSpeak hosted by Griffin Schiller, where the conversation continues after the credits.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”).

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

            "description": "Join my Discord to hang out with me and our community! We also run a bunch of giveaways ONLY on Discord!: https://discord.gg/nFXfAeHakY\n\nWe are BACK at the Casino with… and I know it’s a spoiler… AN ACTUAL GAMBLING WIN ON THE CHANNEL BABY! THE LOSS STREAK IS DEAD, LET’S FIRE! Thank you for watching! I appreciate each and everyone of you supporting me on this journey. Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nBrettski hadn’t slept the night before. A month-long losing streak had hollowed him out—thirty straight days of bad hands, dead spins, and dealers who never seemed to bust. Ten thousand dollars sat in his account, the last of it. Not a bankroll anymore. A lifeline.\n\nThe casino doors slid open and swallowed him whole.\n\nHe started small. Too small. A few blackjack hands. Loss. A slot pull for nostalgia. Loss. His chest tightened. This was how it always began—death by a thousand paper cuts. He stood up, paced, told himself he was done. Then he saw it: an empty high-limit table, green felt pristine, dealer bored.\n\n“One hand,” he muttered.\n\nHe shoved out five grand. The pit boss raised an eyebrow. The cards came out slow. Brettski had twenty. Dealer showed a six. The dealer flipped… busted.\n\nA pulse of electricity hit him. He pressed it. Ten grand out now. Murmurs behind him. Cameras subtly angled closer. The cards flew. Another win. And another.\n\nSuddenly, the streak snapped—violently. Blackjack turned into roulette. Roulette into baccarat. Every move felt reckless, instinctive, wrong. And every move hit. Chips stacked so high they wobbled. Strangers filmed. Security hovered.\n\nIn under an hour, ten thousand became one hundred. Then two.\n\nBrettski laughed for the first time in weeks. His hands shook as the cage confirmed it: $247,000.\n\nHe should’ve cashed out. He knew that. Everyone knew that.\n\nThen the dealer leaned in and said quietly, “You’re on a heater. Tables don’t like to be embarrassed.”\n\nAt that exact moment, his phone buzzed. A single text from an unknown number:\n\n**“Don’t leave. You haven’t won yet.”**\n\nThe lights above the table flickered.\n\nAnd the dealer began to shuffle again.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination.",
