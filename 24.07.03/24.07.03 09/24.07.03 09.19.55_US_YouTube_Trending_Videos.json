We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.\n\nBobby Carter | June 28, 2024\nWe conclude 2024’s Black Music Month celebration at the Tiny Desk with the catalyst for the all-female lineup, SWV. Year after year, I’ve begged who I consider the greatest girl group ever to come play the Desk. Like the other Black women we’ve hosted this month, SWV has yet to receive the proper acknowledgment for its influence over the past three decades. There was a moment, similar to the sing-along portion of Chaka Khan’s show, when Coko, Taj and Lelee were taken aback while the audience kept the party going after the band stopped playing “I’m So Into You.”\n\nSisters With Voices originated in the church before the group started recording R&B music. It broke through in the 1990s, a decade that was the pinnacle of girl groups. In a landscape including En Vogue, TLC, Xscape and dozens more, SWV remained in front of the pack, topping the charts, amassing gold and platinum plaques and breaking new ground in music, style and sexual liberation. Before playing “You’re The One,” Lelee introduced the song, reminding us that they “kinda took a beating for the team because our music was a little risqué.”\n\nAs a new appreciation for ’90s R&B has emerged over the past several years, SWV has reigned supreme. Watching the audience sway and sing to songs like “Weak” and “Rain,” I’m reminded of the lasting quality of SWV that continues to connect us.\n\nSET LIST\n“I'm So Into You”\n“Right Here (Human Nature Radio Mix)”\n“You're the One”\n“You're Always On My Mind”\n“Rain”\n“Weak”\n“Anything (Old Skool Radio Version)”\n\nMUSICIANS\nCoko: vocals\nTaj: vocals\nLelee: vocals\nE.

Make sure to check them out here! 🕺🏻 https://www.rwlasvegas.com/\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! You asked and we're here to deliver - a second installment of us attempting to eat at every celebrity chef's restaurant on the Vegas strip!!

It’s an animatronic puppet that sits in a music box that you have to keep winding up. If you let the music run out, it attacks!\n\nTo bring the puppet from FNAF to life, we sculpted its body out of foam and 3D printed its mask. The mask was then textured and painted while the body was covered in a scratchy black velvet. To achieve its classic jumpscare, we built a pneumatic scissor mech that quickly pushes it 3 feet forwards and we hid a secret pneumatic in its chest to make its arms reach forward as it jumps.\n\nThis was a really fun DIY FNAF animatronic to make and the best part was we got to test it out and scare a TON of kids with it! We love making scary halloween animatronics, so let us know who you want to see next!\n\n#FNAF\n#Animatronics\n#FiveNightsAtFreddys",

It’s an animatronic puppet that sits in a music box that you have to keep winding up. If you let the music run out, it attacks!\n\nTo bring the puppet from FNAF to life, we sculpted its body out of foam and 3D printed its mask. The mask was then textured and painted while the body was covered in a scratchy black velvet. To achieve its classic jumpscare, we built a pneumatic scissor mech that quickly pushes it 3 feet forwards and we hid a secret pneumatic in its chest to make its arms reach forward as it jumps.\n\nThis was a really fun DIY FNAF animatronic to make and the best part was we got to test it out and scare a TON of kids with it! We love making scary halloween animatronics, so let us know who you want to see next!\n\n#FNAF\n#Animatronics\n#FiveNightsAtFreddys"

                "description": "92%ers we are back with another episode of New Heights sponsored by Crown Royal. \n\nIn this episode, we are live from the Passyunk Avenue Bar in London, England! \n\nBefore we get into what you all have been waiting for we have to tie up one last Beer Bowl loose end, Travis breaks down his weekend in Nashville golfing with Wayne Gretzky and attending Tight End U, and Jason how his charity golf outing almost got derailed by some Philly hecklers. \n\nThen we gotta talk about it. Jason recaps his first night attending the Eras tour, explains why holding a beer with your teeth isn’t a big deal, and what meeting the Royal family was like. \n\nAnd finally, because this is our London Special, the guys also take a “London Slang Quiz,” revive “Player’s As” with figures from the Revolutionary War, answer some No Dumb Questions about playing overseas, and sample some authentic British cuisine throughout the episode. \n\nWe will be back with more New Heights every Wednesday during the offseason so make sure you’re subscribed to our YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don’t miss a single episode and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show. \n\nIf you’d like to contribute to New Heights Show & Tell, please send your items to: New Heights PO Box 251799.

            "description": "Watch as we give our Franna crane winch a complete transformation! First things first we’re getting everything cleaned up using the hotwash for the internal planetary gears and blasting the plates clean with our dustless blaster. But this rebuild isn't just about shining up old parts. We'll be machining brand new components for the cable tension adjuster, starting with making the bosses and shaft with our lathe before drilling and tapping holes for the grub screws in our milling machine. We also countersink the spring arm plates to give a seamless fit for the bolts. With the new parts ready, it's welding time! We'll weld the adjuster plates and bosses together and while the welds cool, we’ll begin meticulously re-assembling the winch. We start with carefully assembling all the planetary gears before they get installed back into the winch drum. Then the plates get bolted in place, before the rebuilt hydraulic motor gets installed and finally, the brand-new cable tensioner takes its place. And just like that, the once-tired winch is reborn! To finish it all off, we'll give it a fresh coat of paint, making it look (and function) as good as new!

            "description": "In this video, Mike tells Rich Evans to watch The Acolyte. Not because Mike and Rich love a Star Wars™.... I mean, perhaps somewhere deep down in their cold, dead hearts they still do? But Mike asks Rich to watch The Acolyte because Mike knows Rich is one of the most honest, unbiased people he's ever met. Rich will tell it like it is. He’ll never sugar-coat anything. Now, this video is less about The Acolyte and more about the culture war surrounding it. After Ghostbusters 2016, they felt we were all past this as human beings. A movie or show is good or bad based on the quality and nothing else. Mike saw the figurative streets set on fire after the “Lesbian Witch” episode and his curiosity was piqued. What is this? What’s all the fuss? Then there is the now famous \"R2D2 is a lesbian\" clip. NOW Mike is REALLY interested because he always considered R2D2 to be straight or maybe bi. \n\nAll this madness stems from one thing tearing us all apart: Politics. Specifically identity politics. This show has become the figurative rope in a tug-of-war match between people that don’t want certain things in their Star War and people that do. Mike and Rich really don’t give two shits. They wanted to step back and look at this whole circus (note to editor: find more circus music) and comment on why it is happening now and what we all can do to prepare for the future (invest in canned foods and shotguns). We harbor no ill will towards anyone on the internet whose content we’ve referenced. From those that produce content complaining about The Acolyte and those that defend it. Everyone has a right to their ppinion and free speech on this topic and that includes us. We wanted to look at this whole situation, analyze it, discuss how we got here and possibly offer solutions. This world has become an unbearable nightmare and I want my ashes shot into a black hole. Part of me hopes that a huge solar flare from the sun reaches Earth and knocks out everything that runs on electricity. Then we can all then stop and listen to the sounds of nature. Get off social media for a while. See the beauty of this world we all share together... and then think about how outrageous it is that they called R2D2 a lesbian!!!!!!",
