            "description": "On Thursday, June 27th, 2024, at an airfield in Örebro, Sweden, a Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut driven by factory test driver, Markus Lundh, completed several new world records for a fully homologated production vehicle.\n\nIn one acceleration, from stand still, up to 412.72 km/h and back down again, the Jesko Absolut managed to take the following production car records:\n \n0-400-0 km/h in 27.83 seconds. That's 0.98 seconds faster than the 28.81sec record for the same run set in 2023 by the Koenigsegg Regera at the same airfield. The Jesko Absolut's minimal downforce design (Cd of just 0.278) helped the car achieve the 0-400 km/h sprint section of the run in a mere 18.82 seconds (vs. 20.68s for Regera). \n \n0-250-0 mph in 28.27 seconds. That´s 1.33 seconds faster than the Regera's 2023 record. The 0-250 mph sprint was achieved in 19.20 seconds.\n \nThe Jesko Absolut was driven in standard, as-delivered form except for a roll cage fitted for driver protection, plus a One:1 seat favoured by the driver. It was running on E85 fuel and shod with Michelin Cup2 R tires. Times were recorded and verified using industry-standard timing equipment from Racelogic with verification of the data by Racelogic Ltd HQ.\n\n\n\n\n\nShop Koenigsegg Gear:\nhttps://gear.koenigsegg.com\n\nFollow KOENIGSEGG:\nhttps://www.koenigsegg.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/koenigsegg\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/koenigsegg\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KoenigseggAutomotiveAB\n\nAn In-House Koenigsegg Production\n\nLicense:\nKoenigsegg\nwww.koenigsegg.com\nMusicbed SyncID:MB01PZO8IIERFEW\n\n#Koenigsegg #JeskoAbsolut #WorldRecord",

Known for standout performances, the octet have turned storytelling into a full musical experience. The eight members of ATEEZ are HONGJOONG, SEONGHWA, YUNHO, YEOSANG, SAN, MINGI, WOOYOUNG, and JONGHO. Their group name stood for ‘everything teenagers need from A to Z’, and has since evolved alongside their fans (named ATINY) to become ‘everything you need from A to Z’. Establishing themselves as top artists early on in their career with a sold out global tour only four months after their debut, they continue to break their own records. In 2024, they dominated on the global stage, taking over festivals around the world with performances at Coachella (US) and Summer Sonic (JPN), even set to headline at Mawazine (MAR). With a unique narrative that starts from the very first release in the ‘TREASURE’ album series and continues through the ‘FEVER’ and ‘THE WORLD’ masterpieces, taking a turn into a new universe with the start of the ‘GOLDEN HOUR’ series, the group combines bestseller narratives with personalized music that speaks to their generation. The pirates of the high K-pop seas ATEEZ have made their mark as a million seller group, topping the Billboard 200 with multiple releases.\n\n＜ATEEZ SNS＞\nOfficial Platform : https://ateez.kqent.com/\nATEEZ Official X : https://twitter.com/ATEEZofficial\nATEEZ Official Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/ATEEZ_official_/\nATEEZ Official TikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@ateez_official_\nATEEZ Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/ATEEZofficial\n\n＜KQ SNS＞\nKQ Official Homepage : https://kqent.com/\nKQ Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/kqent\nKQ Official X : https://x.com/kqent\nKQ Official Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/kqent/   \n\nBE:FIRST / Music Video - Playlist -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbnrvWONK6FdEWKeXArhrUMu53Xb7ruxl\n\nBE:FIRST / Streaming \nhttps://befirst.lnk.to/Streaming\n\n#BF_ATEEZ_HushHush\n#BESTINY\n#BEFIRST \n#ATEEZ\n#HushHush\n#BMSG\n#BME\n#BESTY\n#BEFIRSTXBESTY",

Known for standout performances, the octet have turned storytelling into a full musical experience. The eight members of ATEEZ are HONGJOONG, SEONGHWA, YUNHO, YEOSANG, SAN, MINGI, WOOYOUNG, and JONGHO. Their group name stood for ‘everything teenagers need from A to Z’, and has since evolved alongside their fans (named ATINY) to become ‘everything you need from A to Z’. Establishing themselves as top artists early on in their career with a sold out global tour only four months after their debut, they continue to break their own records. In 2024, they dominated on the global stage, taking over festivals around the world with performances at Coachella (US) and Summer Sonic (JPN), even set to headline at Mawazine (MAR). With a unique narrative that starts from the very first release in the ‘TREASURE’ album series and continues through the ‘FEVER’ and ‘THE WORLD’ masterpieces, taking a turn into a new universe with the start of the ‘GOLDEN HOUR’ series, the group combines bestseller narratives with personalized music that speaks to their generation. The pirates of the high K-pop seas ATEEZ have made their mark as a million seller group, topping the Billboard 200 with multiple releases.\n\n＜ATEEZ SNS＞\nOfficial Platform : https://ateez.kqent.com/\nATEEZ Official X : https://twitter.com/ATEEZofficial\nATEEZ Official Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/ATEEZ_official_/\nATEEZ Official TikTok : https://www.tiktok.com/@ateez_official_\nATEEZ Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/ATEEZofficial\n\n＜KQ SNS＞\nKQ Official Homepage : https://kqent.com/\nKQ Official Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/kqent\nKQ Official X : https://x.com/kqent\nKQ Official Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/kqent/   \n\nBE:FIRST / Music Video - Playlist -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbnrvWONK6FdEWKeXArhrUMu53Xb7ruxl\n\nBE:FIRST / Streaming \nhttps://befirst.lnk.to/Streaming\n\n#BF_ATEEZ_HushHush\n#BESTINY\n#BEFIRST \n#ATEEZ\n#HushHush\n#BMSG\n#BME\n#BESTY\n#BEFIRSTXBESTY"

            "description": "After nearly 7 months away, we're finally back at our cabin in the woods! Thanks to AG1 for sponsoring this video. Head to https://drinkag1.com/eamonandbec for a special offer 💜 \n\nSubscribe to our podcast! Weekly episodes coming soon:\nhttps://youtube.com/@REROOTwithEamonandBec?si=if-TsNUT6o5Gbstk\n\n\nMake sure you also check out our friends @RayaandLouis  They make amazing travel content with their little family. Their episode from their time with us at the cabin is now live here: \n\nWe moved out to our cabin in the woods 4 years ago & every time summer comes around we forget just how much work it is to open the cabin for the \"season\" after our harsh Canadian winter. So, we get to work installing water lines, tidying the grounds and rescuing our floating docks. Craziest part is that we have a 7 month old joining us this time making us much, MUCH less productive 😜  Would you live at our cabin in the Canadian winter? Summer? or year round?\n\nWe're Eamon & Bec ((and Oso) and now Frankie!!). We once lived very minimally out of vans #vanlife but happily moved into the woods during the pandemic #cabinlife . When we found out we were going to have a baby we decided to also rent an apartment in the city so we can be surrounded by support and love!",

                "description": "After nearly 7 months away, we're finally back at our cabin in the woods! Thanks to AG1 for sponsoring this video. Head to https://drinkag1.com/eamonandbec for a special offer 💜 \n\nSubscribe to our podcast! Weekly episodes coming soon:\nhttps://youtube.com/@REROOTwithEamonandBec?si=if-TsNUT6o5Gbstk\n\n\nMake sure you also check out our friends @RayaandLouis  They make amazing travel content with their little family. Their episode from their time with us at the cabin is now live here: \n\nWe moved out to our cabin in the woods 4 years ago & every time summer comes around we forget just how much work it is to open the cabin for the \"season\" after our harsh Canadian winter. So, we get to work installing water lines, tidying the grounds and rescuing our floating docks. Craziest part is that we have a 7 month old joining us this time making us much, MUCH less productive 😜  Would you live at our cabin in the Canadian winter? Summer? or year round?\n\nWe're Eamon & Bec ((and Oso) and now Frankie!!). We once lived very minimally out of vans #vanlife but happily moved into the woods during the pandemic #cabinlife . When we found out we were going to have a baby we decided to also rent an apartment in the city so we can be surrounded by support and love!"

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents.

            "description": "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.\n\nBobby Carter | June 28, 2024\nWe conclude 2024’s Black Music Month celebration at the Tiny Desk with the catalyst for the all-female lineup, SWV. Year after year, I’ve begged who I consider the greatest girl group ever to come play the Desk. Like the other Black women we’ve hosted this month, SWV has yet to receive the proper acknowledgment for its influence over the past three decades. There was a moment, similar to the sing-along portion of Chaka Khan’s show, when Coko, Taj and Lelee were taken aback while the audience kept the party going after the band stopped playing “I’m So Into You.”\n\nSisters With Voices originated in the church before the group started recording R&B music. It broke through in the 1990s, a decade that was the pinnacle of girl groups. In a landscape including En Vogue, TLC, Xscape and dozens more, SWV remained in front of the pack, topping the charts, amassing gold and platinum plaques and breaking new ground in music, style and sexual liberation. Before playing “You’re The One,” Lelee introduced the song, reminding us that they “kinda took a beating for the team because our music was a little risqué.”\n\nAs a new appreciation for ’90s R&B has emerged over the past several years, SWV has reigned supreme. Watching the audience sway and sing to songs like “Weak” and “Rain,” I’m reminded of the lasting quality of SWV that continues to connect us.\n\nSET LIST\n“I'm So Into You”\n“Right Here (Human Nature Radio Mix)”\n“You're the One”\n“You're Always On My Mind”\n“Rain”\n“Weak”\n“Anything (Old Skool Radio Version)”\n\nMUSICIANS\nCoko: vocals\nTaj: vocals\nLelee: vocals\nE.
