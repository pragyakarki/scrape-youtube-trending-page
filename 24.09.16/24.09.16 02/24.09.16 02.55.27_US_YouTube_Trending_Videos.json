            "description": "Mexican superstar and pound-for-pound great Canelo Álvarez delivered another virtuoso performance by dropping the previously unbeaten Edgar Berlanga on his way to defending his unified WBC, WBA and WBO Super Middleweight World Championships via unanimous decision as Canelo Promotions presented a Mexican Independence Day Weekend extravaganza headlining a PBC Pay-Per-View available on Prime Video Saturday night from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n \n\"I did good. Now what are they gonna say? They said I don't fight young fighters. They always talk, but I'm the best fighter in the world,” said Canelo.\n \nIn the latest edition of the historic boxing rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico, Canelo (62-2-2, 39 KOs) sent his legion of fans into a frenzy early as he connected on a perfect left hook midway through round three that sent Berlanga (22-1, 17 KOs) to the mat. Berlanga was able to make it through the round and tried to impose his physicality on Canelo, with the two getting tied up, trading low blows and nearly hitting the canvas in a tense moment during round five.\n \n\"I got a little angry with his tactics, but I'm Mexican man,” said Canelo. “It means a lot to fight on this day. It's an honor to represent my country on this day.”\n \n\"I'm upset because at the end of the day I'm a winner,” said Berlanga. “I fought a legend tonight and did my best to represent Puerto Rico. We're fighters and we try to throw our opponent off their game. I took his best shot and I knew I could take his punches and return them. I could have jabbed a lot more, but I was in there with a legend.”\n \nUsing the ring generalship that’s made him a future Hall of Famer, Canelo continued to control the action, turning up the heat in the later rounds, landing 16 power shots in round eight and 20 in round ten, according to CompuBox. The punch stats reflected Canelo’s dominance throughout the 12 rounds, as he out landed Berlanga 201 to 119.\n \n\"My experience and my talent was the difference,” said Canelo. “It's about hard work and intelligence. It's everything together. If you have talent, you need discipline as well.”\n \nBerlanga remained game throughout, continuing to throw punches and look for openings, even as Canelo broke him down with his varied attack. In the end, Canelo’s 49% connect rate on power punches buoyed him to victory by scores of 118-109 twice and 117-110.\n \n\"A lot of people say we can't, but we can,” said Canelo “Las Vegas is like a second home for Mexicans. We are warriors and we never give up. I’m going to rest and then I'm going to decide what's next.\"\n\n#CaneloBerlanga #Canelo #Berlanga\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

Gravir l'Everest, un idéal qui semblait hors de portée mais qu'il a rendu possible en suivant plusieurs étapes. Le premier pas est de rêver, le deuxième est de partager ce rêve avec ses proches, car cela crée une responsabilité et un engagement. Ensuite, il faut se plier à une discipline rigoureuse, essentielle pour surmonter les obstacles et se renforcer mentalement. L'importance de l'entourage est soulignée : on ne réalise pas un grand rêve seul, mais en équipe, en s'entourant de personnes qui apportent des perspectives et des énergies complémentaires.

                "description": "Devenir alpiniste et gravir l’Everest en 1 an, jour pour jour ? C’est mon rêve ! Moi, un jeune YouTuber de 21 ans qui ne pratique pas de sport. \nPendant 1 an, vous allez me suivre dans ce documentaire pour découvrir tout mon changement de vie afin d'atteindre ce rêve. \nJ'espère sincèrement que ce documentaire vous impactera autant qu'il a impacté ma vie. \n\nKaizen\" est une philosophie de progression continue, consistant à s'améliorer chaque jour, pas à pas. Gravir l'Everest, un idéal qui semblait hors de portée mais qu'il a rendu possible en suivant plusieurs étapes. Le premier pas est de rêver, le deuxième est de partager ce rêve avec ses proches, car cela crée une responsabilité et un engagement. Ensuite, il faut se plier à une discipline rigoureuse, essentielle pour surmonter les obstacles et se renforcer mentalement. L'importance de l'entourage est soulignée : on ne réalise pas un grand rêve seul, mais en équipe, en s'entourant de personnes qui apportent des perspectives et des énergies complémentaires. Enfin, Kaizen c'est combattre ses peurs et agir malgré le doute. Chaque rêve est un chemin de progrès constant, où l’important est de devenir meilleur que soi-même, chaque jour.\n\nMerci à mes partenaires air up, Nike, Deezer, Fitness Park, Erborian, Les Produits Laitiers, Orange, et Therm-ic de m’avoir accompagné et soutenu dans ce projet fou !\n\nUn Documentaire de Inoxtag, Basile Monnot, Samy Bouyssié, Quentin Eiden\nRéalisateur: Basile Monnot\nProduit par Inoxtag\nProducteur exécutif: Samy Bouyssié\n\nChef-Monteur: Quentin Eiden\nChef d’expédition: Mathis Dumas\nCompositeur & directeur musical: Emilien “Mim” Berneaux\nProduction exécutive: IDZ Prod (Webedia Group)"

Dive in with us as we go through the process of taking the Leroy body down to 1/16 scale, and creating a prototype RC body to fit the 1970 Chevy Chevelle mini no prep drag car by Losi from Horizon Hobby. Through 3d scanning using Creaform, 3d printing and some random materials, we finish the Leroy Replica RC Body. We then take it to the Freedom Factory to present it to @CleetusM  to get his thoughts. We're thrilled about not only the Leroy Body making a debut soon, but also excited to see where things go with the RC Body. Hope you enjoy the video. Thanks for your support!

This is the first episode of many.\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dream.shop\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt 2: TITAN TAKEDOWN. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is a massive, near invincible TITAN, being controlled by a real life human projected into the game using our custom fusion technology, instead of multiple hunters. This is the toughest challenge I have faced yet. I'm excited to see how this goes over the coming months.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. \n\nThe TITAN theme music is custom scored by Dream & PmBata. Will hopefully be custom sound tracking all the future videos so anyone can feel free to react! (this has two non-custom songs in it, but not during the hunt)\n\nIf this video somehow gets 1,000,000 likes we'll announce the date of the next episode early.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.

            "description": "People across the country tuned into the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, where both candidates were looking for a knockout to kickstart the 2024 presidential election season. \r\n\r\nSome of those who tuned in included students from Dickinson College in Cumberland County. The school partnered with its student senate to host a watch party, which student body president Andrew Garcia says allowed students from both sides of the political spectrum to come together for proactive discussions.\r\n\r\n“Everyone has different beliefs, especially with elections,” Garcia said. \"So, by having everyone have a shared space to watch it you can have different opinions, and if you do it in a safe way it's very conducive.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the most important topics for students going into the debate included gun control, immigration and abortion.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/presidential-debate-watch-party-dickinson-college-kamala-harris-donald-trump/521-b172702b-13c7-4030-9e86-4b850e448b38\r\n\r\nWPMT-FOX43's YouTube channel is a hub for the best of FOX43 News and its investigative reports, top headlines, and digital exclusive content: youtube.com/c/fox43 SUBSCRIBE: youtube.com/c/fox43",

Life as you know it can change in an instant and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters and road unknown.\n\nThe cancer journey is complex, scary and unpredictable for everyone, especially those closest to you.\n\nWith humility, it also brings you face to face with your own vulnerabilities in a way you have never considered before, and with that, a new perspective on everything.\n\nThis time has above all reminded William and me to reflect and be grateful for the simple yet important things in life, which so many of us often take for granted. Of simply loving and being loved. \n\nDoing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus. Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes.\n\nI am however looking forward to being back at work and undertaking a few more public engagements in the coming months when I can.\n\nDespite all that has gone before I enter this new phase of recovery with a renewed sense of hope and appreciation of life.\n\nWilliam and I are so grateful for the support we have received and have drawn great strength from all those who are helping us at this time. Everyone’s kindness, empathy and compassion has been truly humbling.\n\nTo all those who are continuing their own cancer journey – I remain with you, side by side, hand in hand. Out of darkness, can come light so let that light shine bright.\n\n🎬 by Will Warr https://www.instagram.com/willwarr",
