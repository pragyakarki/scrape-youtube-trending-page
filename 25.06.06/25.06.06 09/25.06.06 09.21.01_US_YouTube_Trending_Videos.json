Watch the #WickedForGood trailer now  🧹🫧\n\nPre-save ‘Wicked: For Good – The Soundtrack’ at https://wickedthesoundtrack.com\n-----\nTikTok: tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook: FACEBOOK.com/wickedmovie \nX: x.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram: instagram.com/wickedmovie\nOfficial Site: www.wickedmovie.com\n\nAnd now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend …\n\nLast year’s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. \n\nDirected once again by award-winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda’s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba’s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award® nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars® for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

            "description": "Today we're speedrunning Phineas and Ferb games, and some of these are suprisingly amazing for speedruns\n\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\nWatch live at: https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nGame timestamps:\n0:00 Agent P: Strikes Back\n5:31 Perry Widgets\n9:04 Transport-inators of Doom\n19:53 Gadget Golf\n22:44 Heroes of Danville\n24:53 Tower-inator\n28:55 Agent P: Rebel Spy\n35:53 Dimension of Doom\n42:50 Escape from Mole-Tropolis\n49:24 Gadget Golf Winter Holiday Edition\n\nFor this video I tried speedrunning every Phineas and Ferb flash games that I could get working, and had a speedrun leaderboard. Unfortunately though I couldn't get the game called Droid Masters to work so couldn't add that one in. I also did the speedrun for Agent P: Return of the Platypus, but it's way too similar to Rebel Spy so I left it out\n\nAlso since I just did webgames, let me know if I should try speedrunning something like Across the 2nd Dimension at some point!\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #PhineasAndFerb #Speedrun",

On this NBA Finals Preview Episode, LeBron James and Steve Nash break down why this Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers series might be the most compelling Finals matchup in years.\n\nLeBron gives insight to Tyrese Haliburton's mindset from their time together on Team USA at the Paris Olympics, and Steve praises his offensive initiation and passing. The conversation dives into how Hali’s pace, vision, and unpredictability fuel Indiana’s offense—and how T.J.

She circled back around toward Shadow and Jackie’s favorite roost tree…\n\nGizmo watched the whole thing from right beside Sunny. She looked completely fascinated and kept her eyes on Sunny flying away from the nest.\n…and a bit later, our awesome camera operatiors were able to find Sunny, perching near the top of the roost tree (upper center on the screen) – watch closely and her practice flapping will show you where she is. \n\nSunny may return to the nest…Jackie and Shadow’s previous eaglets have all done that. It is all up to her at this point. But in any case, Jackie and Shadow will be keeping an eye on Sunny, bringing her food, guarding her and teaching her all that she needs to know to be out in the world. All while they also continue taking care of Gizmo.

When we first started learning this game, they may have been having a rough time with it, but there is a point where this game clicks for you when you get far enough into the game, and this is one of the reasons that we gave it such a review score on the channel once this game really clicked. That's when the fun starts happening in this game, and you have to play enough to really get to that point and really understand some of the mechanics of that.

Realizing the weight of what he put his son through, Dexter sets out for New York City, determined to find him and make things right. But closure won’t come easy. When Miami Metro’s Angel Batista (David Zayas) arrives with questions, Dexter realizes his past is catching up to him fast. As father and son navigate their own darkness in the city that never sleeps, they soon find themselves deeper than they ever imagined—and that the only way out is together.\n\nSubscribe for More!: https://www.youtube.com/@Dexter\n\nFollow Dexter:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DexterOnShowtime\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sho_dexter\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dexteronshowtime\nX: https://twitter.com/SHO_Dexter",

Hall is back in Dexter: Resurrection, premiering July 11th on the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME plan.\n\n#DexterResurrection #Dexter #Showtime #ParamountPlus\n\nParamount+ is here! Stream all your favorite shows now on Paramount+. Try it FREE at https://bit.ly/3qyOeOf\n\nDEXTER: RESURRECTION, a continuation of DEXTER®: NEW BLOOD, takes place weeks after Dexter Morgan (Hall) takes a bullet to the chest from his own son, as he awakens from a coma to find Harrison (Jack Alcott) gone without a trace. Realizing the weight of what he put his son through, Dexter sets out for New York City, determined to find him and make things right. But closure won’t come easy. When Miami Metro’s Angel Batista (David Zayas) arrives with questions, Dexter realizes his past is catching up to him fast. As father and son navigate their own darkness in the city that never sleeps, they soon find themselves deeper than they ever imagined—and that the only way out is together.\n\nSubscribe for More!: https://www.youtube.com/@Dexter\n\nFollow Dexter:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DexterOnShowtime\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sho_dexter\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dexteronshowtime\nX: https://twitter.com/SHO_Dexter"

            "description": "In his ring return, Charlo dominated throughout, showing off his trademark jab early and often (44 total jabs landed), while peppering in straight right hands and left hooks off his signature punch. Charlo scored his first of three knockdowns in round three, hurting LaManna with a straight right before sending him down with a left hook.\n \nThe Houston-native struck again in round four, landing another left hook that forced LaManna to buckle and take a knee. While referee Mark Nelson originally ruled no knockdown, that decision was overturned on video review between rounds.\n \nCharlo returned to his dominance in the fifth frame, this time delivering a laser right hand that put LaManna down for the third time. Although LaManna was able to make it to the bell, he was worse for wear, leading to the referee stopping the bout on advice from the ringside physician.  \n \n\"I'm just looking to stay well-known and relevant,” said Charlo. “No more dark places and keep my head straight. I just want to encourage everyone in the world, keep God first, keep God first.”\n \n\"It is what it is, I did the best I could,” said LaManna. “The doctors are here for a reason and they made their decision. I'm disappointed, but it's boxing…Charlo was sharper than I expected. I expected him to come out guns blazing a little more. He's a two-time world champion for a reason. He has a great, heavy jab and he did what he had to do.\"\n\n#CharloLaManna #JermallCharlo #Boxing \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

                "description": "In his ring return, Charlo dominated throughout, showing off his trademark jab early and often (44 total jabs landed), while peppering in straight right hands and left hooks off his signature punch. Charlo scored his first of three knockdowns in round three, hurting LaManna with a straight right before sending him down with a left hook.\n \nThe Houston-native struck again in round four, landing another left hook that forced LaManna to buckle and take a knee. While referee Mark Nelson originally ruled no knockdown, that decision was overturned on video review between rounds.\n \nCharlo returned to his dominance in the fifth frame, this time delivering a laser right hand that put LaManna down for the third time. Although LaManna was able to make it to the bell, he was worse for wear, leading to the referee stopping the bout on advice from the ringside physician.  \n \n\"I'm just looking to stay well-known and relevant,” said Charlo. “No more dark places and keep my head straight. I just want to encourage everyone in the world, keep God first, keep God first.”\n \n\"It is what it is, I did the best I could,” said LaManna. “The doctors are here for a reason and they made their decision. I'm disappointed, but it's boxing…Charlo was sharper than I expected. I expected him to come out guns blazing a little more. He's a two-time world champion for a reason. He has a great, heavy jab and he did what he had to do.\"\n\n#CharloLaManna #JermallCharlo #Boxing \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 what's Rovos Rail? \n01:46 Day 1: train station & boarding\n05:15 day 2: full train tour\n13:50 Zimbabwe boarder \n17:30 Day 3: our Deluxe Suite tour\n24:28 no cell phones allowed\n26:23 Zimbabwe excursion!\n28:29 Day 4 train safari through Hwange Park\n31:36 game drive!\n34:25 this makes me lol\n36:07 Day 5: swimming above Victoria Falls\n41:09 bloops",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 what's Rovos Rail? \n01:46 Day 1: train station & boarding\n05:15 day 2: full train tour\n13:50 Zimbabwe boarder \n17:30 Day 3: our Deluxe Suite tour\n24:28 no cell phones allowed\n26:23 Zimbabwe excursion!\n28:29 Day 4 train safari through Hwange Park\n31:36 game drive!\n34:25 this makes me lol\n36:07 Day 5: swimming above Victoria Falls\n41:09 bloops"

            "description": "This is the definitive review of the new, 1064-hp C8 Corvette ZR1, together with every previous-generation ZR1 (the C4, C6, and C7.) Also featuring the Lamborghini Revuelto, Ferrari 296 GTS and Ferrari SF90. Starring Jason Cammisa and Randy Pobst, the episode also includes drag races and track battles with the C4 Corvette ZR-1, the C6 ZR1, and the C7 ZR1, as well as a Ferrari 348 Serie Speciale.\n\n===\nINSURANCE QUOTE: Visit https://hagerty.com/jason\n\nSPECIAL THANKS to Falcon Car Rental!   https://falconcarrental.com\nUse coupon code HAGERTY for: \n5% off a 1- to 6-day rental!\n20% off a 7- to 27-day rental!\n35% off any rental 28 days or longer!\n===\n\nThe brand new 2025 and 2026 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 packs a 1064-hp punch from its twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter LT7 V-8. It wears the largest turbochargers ever fitted to a production passenger-car engine. This flat-plane-crank V-8 shares its architecture with the Corvette Z06's naturally aspirated LT6,. Cammisa's non-ZTK-package test car has the optional aero kit, but not the track suspension and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tires from the Z06. Instead, it's wearing Michelin Pilot Sport 4S (PS4S) tires with a more livable suspension to take its place as the do-everything Corvette.\n\nAnd it starts with speed — through the quarter-mile, we recorded 9.8 seconds at 146 mph, making this (by a significant margin) the quickest two-wheel drive car we've ever tested. \n\nThe ZR1 badge means \"King of the Hill\" in Corvette-speak, and was invented as a competition package for the C3 Corvette. In 1989, the 1990 Corvette ZR-1 debuted as the first to wear the badge — and was immediately called The Corvette From Hell. It was the fastest accelerating car in the land, and the second-fastest car you could buy in America. But it wasn't a one-trick pony, breaking records for lap times, lateral grip, and braking distances by using technology to improve its performance. Its 5.7-liter LT5 engine was designed by Lotus, built by Mercury Marine, and featured 4 camshafts and 32 valves — something no Corvette had until the LT6/LT7 Gemini twins in the C8. \n\nIn this episode, we race the C4 ZR-1 against the mid-engine Ferrari of the moment, the 348 (and a Serie Speciale, to boot.) The performance wasn't even close — the Ferrari is a magnificent piece of engineering, but the Corvette beat it in every measure. \n\n15 years later came the C6 Corvette ZR1, known internally initially as the Blue Devil. It featured a supercharged 6.2-liter LS9 V-8 that made 638 hp. Once again, the ZR1 badge stood for bandwidth, meaning the ZR1 did it all: it once again broke records for handling and braking, and lap times to boot, with a Laguna Seca lap record set by our very own, SCCA Hall of Fame race-car driver, and cohost Randy Pobst.\n\nThe C7 Corvette ZR1, which came 10 full years later, was born into a different time, where Ferraris had gained turbochargers and got serious about speed. The C7 ZR1 used the 6.2-liter LT5, supercharged to 755 hp, to keep pace with the newly turbocharged mid-engine Ferraris, specifically the 488. In trying to keep up, the C7 proved difficult to handle, and spelled the end of the front-engine Corvette.\n\nThe C8 is an entirely different animal, and with its mid-mounted, flat-plane-crankshaft V-8 and mandatory dual-clutch automatic, closely resembles Ferrari's recipe. Which, now, Lamborghini is copying with the forthcoming Temerario. So, to all those saying the C8 is an American Ferrari, Jason suggests it's far more like an American Lamborghini — complete major power and brash looks. \n\nAnd besides, Ferrari has moved away, with the 296 GTB and GTS using a 120-degree V-6 in place of the high-revving flat-plane-crank V-8 that Ferrari invented. \n\nSo how does the C8 ZR1 stack up? Watch and find out: 3 drag races, multiple power slides, drifts, burnouts, and even some low-speed city driving. We cover it all on this award-winning ICONS series.\n\n\nContact us:\nSuggestions and feedback - videoquestions@hagerty.com\nPress inquiries - press@hagerty.com\nPartnership requests - partnerships@hagerty.com",

Er verfügt über die größten Turbolader, die je in einem Serien-Pkw-Motor verbaut wurden. Dieser V8-Motor mit flacher Kurbelwelle hat die gleiche Architektur wie der LT6-Saugmotor der Corvette Z06. Cammisas Testwagen ohne ZTK-Paket verfügt über das optionale Aerodynamik-Kit, jedoch nicht über das Rennstreckenfahrwerk und die Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R-Reifen der Z06. Stattdessen ist er mit Michelin Pilot Sport 4S-Reifen (PS4S) und einem komfortableren Fahrwerk ausgestattet und nimmt damit seinen Platz als Allround-Corvette ein.\n\nUnd das fängt schon bei der Geschwindigkeit an: Auf der Viertelmeile maßen wir 9,8 Sekunden bei 235 km/h. Damit ist dieser Wagen (mit deutlichem Abstand) das schnellste zweiradgetriebene Auto, das wir je getestet haben. Das ZR1-Emblem bedeutet in der Corvette-Sprache „King of the Hill“ und wurde als Wettbewerbspaket für die C3 Corvette entwickelt. 1989 debütierte die Corvette ZR-1 (Modelljahr 1990) als erste mit diesem Emblem – und wurde sofort als „Corvette aus der Hölle“ bezeichnet. Sie war das am schnellsten beschleunigende Auto der USA und das zweitschnellste, das man in Amerika kaufen konnte. Doch sie war kein Eintagsfliegenfahrzeug: Dank leistungssteigernder Technologie brach sie Rekorde bei Rundenzeiten, Seitenführung und Bremswegen. Ihr 5,7-Liter-LT5-Motor wurde von Lotus entwickelt und von Mercury Marine gebaut und verfügte über vier Nockenwellen und 32 Ventile – etwas, das bis zu den LT6/LT7-Gemini-Zwillingen in der C8 keine Corvette besaß.\n\nIn dieser Folge treten wir mit dem C4 ZR-1 gegen den damaligen Mittelmotor-Ferrari 348 (und noch dazu gegen einen Serie Speciale) an. Die Leistung war nicht einmal annähernd vergleichbar – der Ferrari ist eine großartige Ingenieursleistung, aber die Corvette übertraf ihn in jeder Hinsicht.\n\n15 Jahre später erschien die C6 Corvette ZR1, intern zunächst als „Blue Devil“ bekannt. Sie verfügte über einen aufgeladenen 6,2-Liter-LS9-V8 mit 638 PS. Auch hier stand das ZR1-Emblem für Bandbreite, was bedeutete, dass die ZR1 alles konnte: Sie brach erneut Rekorde in puncto Handling, Bremsen und Rundenzeiten, darunter einen Rundenrekord in Laguna Seca, aufgestellt von unserem eigenen SCCA Hall of Fame-Rennfahrer und Co-Moderator Randy Pobst.\n\nDie C7 Corvette ZR1, die volle 10 Jahre später erschien, stammte aus einer anderen Zeit, in der Ferraris Turbolader hatten und es ernst meinten mit der Geschwindigkeit. Die C7 ZR1 nutzte den 6,2-Liter-LT5, aufgeladen auf 755 PS, um mit den neuen turbogeladenen Mittelmotor-Ferraris, insbesondere dem 488, mithalten zu können. Beim Versuch, mitzuhalten, erwies sich die C7 als schwer zu handhaben und bedeutete das Ende der Corvette mit Frontmotor.\n\nDie C8 ist ein ganz anderes Kaliber und ähnelt mit ihrem mittig montierten V8-Motor mit Flat-Plane-Kurbelwelle und der obligatorischen Doppelkupplungsautomatik stark dem Ferrari-Rezept. Dieses kopiert Lamborghini nun mit dem kommenden Temerario. Allen, die also sagen, die C8 sei ein amerikanischer Ferrari, sagt Jason, sie sei viel mehr ein amerikanischer Lamborghini – mit voller Power und einem knalligen Look.\n\nUnd außerdem hat sich Ferrari davon abgewandt: Der 296 GTB und der GTS verwenden einen 120-Grad-V6 anstelle des von Ferrari erfundenen, hochdrehenden V8-Motors mit Flat-Plane-Kurbelwelle.\n\nWie schlägt sich der C8 ZR1? Schauen Sie rein und finden Sie es heraus: drei Drag Races, mehrere Powerslides, Drifts, Burnouts und sogar langsame Stadtfahrten.

                "description": "Ini adalah ulasan definitif dari C8 Corvette ZR1 baru bertenaga 1064 hp, bersama dengan setiap ZR1 generasi sebelumnya (C4, C6, dan C7). Juga menampilkan Lamborghini Revuelto, Ferrari 296 GTS, dan Ferrari SF90. Dibintangi oleh Jason Cammisa dan Randy Pobst, episode ini juga mencakup balapan drag dan pertarungan trek dengan C4 Corvette ZR-1, C6 ZR1, dan C7 ZR1, serta Ferrari 348 Serie Speciale.\n\n===\nPENAWARAN ASURANSI: Kunjungi https://hagerty.com/jason\n\nUcapan terima kasih khusus kepada Falcon Car Rental! https://falconcarrental.com\nGunakan kode kupon HAGERTY untuk:\n\nDiskon 5% untuk sewa 1 hingga 6 hari!\nDiskon 20% untuk sewa 7 hingga 27 hari!\nDiskon 35% untuk sewa 28 hari atau lebih!\n===\n\nChevrolet Corvette ZR1 2025 dan 2026 yang baru memiliki tenaga 1064 hp dari mesin V-8 LT7 5,5 liter twin-turbocharged. Mobil ini menggunakan turbocharger terbesar yang pernah dipasang pada mesin mobil penumpang produksi. Mesin V-8 flat-plane-crank ini memiliki arsitektur yang sama dengan mesin LT6 naturally aspirated milik Corvette Z06. Mobil uji Cammisa yang tidak menggunakan paket ZTK memiliki aero kit opsional, tetapi tidak memiliki suspensi lintasan dan ban Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R dari Z06. Sebagai gantinya, mobil ini menggunakan ban Michelin Pilot Sport 4S (PS4S) dengan suspensi yang lebih nyaman untuk menggantikan posisinya sebagai Corvette serba bisa.\n\nDan itu dimulai dengan kecepatan — sepanjang seperempat mil, kami mencatat 9,8 detik pada 146 mph, menjadikan ini (dengan selisih yang signifikan) mobil berpenggerak dua roda tercepat yang pernah kami uji. \n\nLencana ZR1 berarti \"Raja Bukit\" dalam bahasa Corvette, dan diciptakan sebagai paket kompetisi untuk C3 Corvette. Pada tahun 1989, Corvette ZR-1 tahun 1990 memulai debutnya sebagai yang pertama memakai lencana tersebut — dan langsung disebut The Corvette From Hell. Itu adalah mobil dengan akselerasi tercepat di negeri itu, dan mobil tercepat kedua yang dapat Anda beli di Amerika. Namun, itu bukan kuda poni satu trik, memecahkan rekor untuk waktu putaran, cengkeraman lateral, dan jarak pengereman dengan menggunakan teknologi untuk meningkatkan kinerjanya. Mesin LT5 berkapasitas 5,7 liternya dirancang oleh Lotus, dibuat oleh Mercury Marine, dan memiliki 4 camshaft dan 32 katup — sesuatu yang tidak dimiliki Corvette hingga mesin kembar LT6/LT7 Gemini di C8. \n\nDalam episode ini, kami akan memacu C4 ZR-1 melawan Ferrari bermesin tengah saat ini, 348 (dan juga Serie Speciale). Performanya bahkan tidak mendekati — Ferrari adalah hasil rekayasa yang luar biasa, tetapi Corvette mengalahkannya dalam segala hal. \n\n15 tahun kemudian muncul C6 Corvette ZR1, yang awalnya dikenal secara internal sebagai Blue Devil. Mobil ini memiliki mesin LS9 V-8 berkapasitas 6,2 liter supercharged yang menghasilkan 638 hp. Sekali lagi, emblem ZR1 melambangkan bandwidth, yang berarti ZR1 melakukan semuanya: sekali lagi memecahkan rekor untuk pengendalian dan pengereman, dan juga waktu putaran, dengan rekor putaran Laguna Seca yang dibuat oleh pembalap mobil SCCA Hall of Fame kami sendiri, dan pembawa acara bersama Randy Pobst.\n\nC7 Corvette ZR1, yang hadir 10 tahun kemudian, lahir di masa yang berbeda, saat Ferrari telah mendapatkan turbocharger dan menjadi serius soal kecepatan. C7 ZR1 menggunakan LT5 6,2 liter, dengan supercharger hingga 755 hp, untuk mengimbangi Ferrari bermesin tengah yang baru dilengkapi turbocharger, khususnya 488. Dalam upaya untuk mengimbangi, C7 terbukti sulit dikendalikan, dan menandai berakhirnya Corvette bermesin depan.\n\nC8 adalah mobil yang sama sekali berbeda, dan dengan V-8 poros engkol bidang datar yang dipasang di tengah dan transmisi otomatis kopling ganda yang wajib, sangat mirip dengan resep Ferrari. Yang sekarang ditiru Lamborghini dengan Temerario yang akan datang. Jadi, bagi mereka yang mengatakan C8 adalah Ferrari Amerika, Jason menyarankan bahwa mobil itu jauh lebih mirip Lamborghini Amerika — tenaga yang sangat besar dan tampilan yang mencolok. \n\nSelain itu, Ferrari telah beralih haluan, dengan 296 GTB dan GTS menggunakan V-6 120 derajat sebagai pengganti V-8 flat-plane-crank berkecepatan tinggi yang diciptakan Ferrari. \n\nJadi, bagaimana perbandingan C8 ZR1? Saksikan dan temukan: 3 balapan drag, beberapa power slide, drift, burnout, dan bahkan beberapa pengendaraan di kota dengan kecepatan rendah.

Ele possui os maiores turbocompressores já instalados em um motor de carro de passeio de produção. Este V-8 com virabrequim plano compartilha sua arquitetura com o LT6 naturalmente aspirado do Corvette Z06. O carro de teste da Cammisa, sem o pacote ZTK, possui o kit aerodinâmico opcional, mas não a suspensão de pista e os pneus Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R do Z06. Em vez disso, ele usa pneus Michelin Pilot Sport 4S (PS4S) com uma suspensão mais confortável para assumir seu lugar como o Corvette multifuncional.\n\nE começa com a velocidade — no quarto de milha, registramos 9,8 segundos a 235 km/h, tornando este (por uma margem significativa) o carro com tração nas duas rodas mais rápido que já testamos.\n\nO emblema ZR1 significa \"Rei da Colina\" na linguagem da Corvette e foi inventado como um pacote de competição para o Corvette C3. Em 1989, o Corvette ZR-1 de 1990 estreou como o primeiro a ostentar o emblema — e foi imediatamente chamado de \"O Corvette do Inferno\". Era o carro com a aceleração mais rápida do país e o segundo carro mais rápido que você poderia comprar nos Estados Unidos. Mas não era um carro de um truque só, quebrando recordes de tempos de volta, aderência lateral e distâncias de frenagem usando tecnologia para melhorar seu desempenho. Seu motor LT5 de 5,7 litros foi projetado pela Lotus, construído pela Mercury Marine e contava com 4 eixos de comando e 32 válvulas — algo que nenhum Corvette tinha até os gêmeos Gemini LT6/LT7 no C8.\n\nNeste episódio, competimos com o C4 ZR-1 contra a Ferrari de motor central do momento, a 348 (e uma Série Especial, para completar). O desempenho não chegou nem perto — a Ferrari é uma obra de engenharia magnífica, mas o Corvette a superou em todos os aspectos.\n\n15 anos depois, surgiu o C6 Corvette ZR1, conhecido internamente inicialmente como Blue Devil. Ele contava com um motor V-8 LS9 de 6,2 litros superalimentado que gerava 638 cv. Mais uma vez, o emblema ZR1 representava largura de banda, o que significava que o ZR1 fazia de tudo: mais uma vez quebrou recordes de dirigibilidade e frenagem, além de tempos de volta, com um recorde de volta em Laguna Seca estabelecido por nosso próprio piloto de corrida do Hall da Fama da SCCA e co-apresentador Randy Pobst.\n\nO C7 Corvette ZR1, que surgiu 10 anos depois, nasceu em uma época diferente, em que as Ferraris ganharam turbocompressores e levaram a velocidade a sério. O C7 ZR1 usava o motor LT5 de 6,2 litros, superalimentado a 755 cv, para acompanhar as Ferraris com motor central recém-turbo, especificamente a 488. Na tentativa de acompanhar, o C7 se mostrou difícil de controlar e significou o fim do Corvette com motor dianteiro.\n\nO C8 é um animal totalmente diferente e, com seu V-8 de virabrequim plano central e câmbio automático de dupla embreagem obrigatório, assemelha-se muito à receita da Ferrari. Que, agora, a Lamborghini está copiando com o próximo Temerario. Então, para todos aqueles que dizem que o C8 é uma Ferrari americana, Jason sugere que ele é muito mais parecido com uma Lamborghini americana — potência total e visual ousado.\n\nE, além disso, a Ferrari se afastou, com o 296 GTB e o GTS usando um V-6 de 120 graus no lugar do V-8 de alta rotação com virabrequim plano que a Ferrari inventou.\n\nEntão, como o C8 ZR1 se sai?

It wears the largest turbochargers ever fitted to a production passenger-car engine. This flat-plane-crank V-8 shares its architecture with the Corvette Z06's naturally aspirated LT6,. Cammisa's non-ZTK-package test car has the optional aero kit, but not the track suspension and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tires from the Z06. Instead, it's wearing Michelin Pilot Sport 4S (PS4S) tires with a more livable suspension to take its place as the do-everything Corvette.\n\nAnd it starts with speed — through the quarter-mile, we recorded 9.8 seconds at 146 mph, making this (by a significant margin) the quickest two-wheel drive car we've ever tested. \n\nThe ZR1 badge means \"King of the Hill\" in Corvette-speak, and was invented as a competition package for the C3 Corvette. In 1989, the 1990 Corvette ZR-1 debuted as the first to wear the badge — and was immediately called The Corvette From Hell. It was the fastest accelerating car in the land, and the second-fastest car you could buy in America. But it wasn't a one-trick pony, breaking records for lap times, lateral grip, and braking distances by using technology to improve its performance. Its 5.7-liter LT5 engine was designed by Lotus, built by Mercury Marine, and featured 4 camshafts and 32 valves — something no Corvette had until the LT6/LT7 Gemini twins in the C8. \n\nIn this episode, we race the C4 ZR-1 against the mid-engine Ferrari of the moment, the 348 (and a Serie Speciale, to boot.) The performance wasn't even close — the Ferrari is a magnificent piece of engineering, but the Corvette beat it in every measure. \n\n15 years later came the C6 Corvette ZR1, known internally initially as the Blue Devil. It featured a supercharged 6.2-liter LS9 V-8 that made 638 hp. Once again, the ZR1 badge stood for bandwidth, meaning the ZR1 did it all: it once again broke records for handling and braking, and lap times to boot, with a Laguna Seca lap record set by our very own, SCCA Hall of Fame race-car driver, and cohost Randy Pobst.\n\nThe C7 Corvette ZR1, which came 10 full years later, was born into a different time, where Ferraris had gained turbochargers and got serious about speed. The C7 ZR1 used the 6.2-liter LT5, supercharged to 755 hp, to keep pace with the newly turbocharged mid-engine Ferraris, specifically the 488. In trying to keep up, the C7 proved difficult to handle, and spelled the end of the front-engine Corvette.\n\nThe C8 is an entirely different animal, and with its mid-mounted, flat-plane-crankshaft V-8 and mandatory dual-clutch automatic, closely resembles Ferrari's recipe. Which, now, Lamborghini is copying with the forthcoming Temerario. So, to all those saying the C8 is an American Ferrari, Jason suggests it's far more like an American Lamborghini — complete major power and brash looks. \n\nAnd besides, Ferrari has moved away, with the 296 GTB and GTS using a 120-degree V-6 in place of the high-revving flat-plane-crank V-8 that Ferrari invented. \n\nSo how does the C8 ZR1 stack up? Watch and find out: 3 drag races, multiple power slides, drifts, burnouts, and even some low-speed city driving. We cover it all on this award-winning ICONS series.\n\n\nContact us:\nSuggestions and feedback - videoquestions@hagerty.com\nPress inquiries - press@hagerty.com\nPartnership requests - partnerships@hagerty.com"

Una vez más, la insignia ZR1 representaba la capacidad de respuesta, lo que significa que el ZR1 lo hizo todo: volvió a batir récords de manejo y frenado, y además, de tiempos de vuelta, con un récord de vuelta en Laguna Seca establecido por nuestro propio piloto de carreras miembro del Salón de la Fama de la SCCA y copresentador, Randy Pobst.\n\nEl C7 Corvette ZR1, que llegó 10 años después, nació en una época diferente, donde los Ferrari habían incorporado turbocompresores y se habían tomado muy en serio la velocidad. El C7 ZR1 utilizaba el motor LT5 de 6.2 litros, sobrealimentado a 755 hp, para seguir el ritmo de los nuevos Ferraris con motor central turboalimentado, específicamente el 488. Al intentar mantener el ritmo, el C7 demostró ser difícil de manejar y significó el fin del Corvette con motor delantero.\n\nEl C8 es un animal completamente diferente, y con su V-8 central con cigüeñal plano y la obligatoria transmisión automática de doble embrague, se asemeja mucho a la receta de Ferrari. Lamborghini lo copia ahora con el próximo Temerario. Así que, a todos aquellos que dicen que el C8 es un Ferrari americano, Jason sugiere que se parece mucho más a un Lamborghini americano: potencia total y un aspecto imponente.\n\nAdemás, Ferrari se ha distanciado de eso, y los 296 GTB y GTS utilizan un V-6 de 120 grados en lugar del V-8 de cigüeñal plano y altas revoluciones que inventó Ferrari.\n\n¿Qué tal se compara el C8 ZR1? Mira y descúbrelo: 3 carreras de aceleración, múltiples derrapes, derrapes, quemados de gasolina e incluso conducción urbana a baja velocidad.

                "description": "Questa è la recensione definitiva della nuova Corvette ZR1 C8 da 1064 CV, insieme a tutte le ZR1 di generazione precedente (C4, C6 e C7). Presenti anche la Lamborghini Revuelto, la Ferrari 296 GTS e la Ferrari SF90. Con Jason Cammisa e Randy Pobst, l'episodio include anche gare di accelerazione e sfide in pista con la Corvette ZR-1 C4, la C6 ZR1 e la C7 ZR1, oltre a una Ferrari 348 Serie Speciale.\n\n===\nPREVENTIVO ASSICURATIVO: Visita https://hagerty.com/jason\n\nUN RINGRAZIAMENTO SPECIALE a Falcon Car Rental! https://falconcarrental.com\nUsa il codice coupon HAGERTY per:\n5% di sconto su un noleggio da 1 a 6 giorni!\n20% di sconto su un noleggio da 7 a 27 giorni!\nSconto del 35% su qualsiasi noleggio di almeno 28 giorni!\n===\n\nLa nuovissima Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 2025 e 2026 eroga 1064 CV grazie al suo motore V8 LT7 biturbo da 5,5 litri. Monta i turbocompressori più grandi mai montati su un motore di serie per autovetture. Questo V8 a albero piatto condivide l'architettura con il motore LT6 aspirato della Corvette Z06. L'auto di prova di Cammisa, senza pacchetto ZTK, monta il kit aerodinamico opzionale, ma non le sospensioni da pista e gli pneumatici Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R della Z06. Monta invece pneumatici Michelin Pilot Sport 4S (PS4S) con sospensioni più confortevoli, per sostituirsi alla Corvette tuttofare.\n\nE inizia con la velocità: nel quarto di miglio, abbiamo registrato 9,8 secondi a 235 km/h, rendendola (con un margine significativo) l'auto a due ruote motrici più veloce che abbiamo mai testato.\n\nIl logo ZR1 significa \"Re della Collina\" nel linguaggio Corvette, ed è stato inventato come pacchetto da competizione per la Corvette C3. Nel 1989, la Corvette ZR-1 del 1990 debuttò come prima a portare il logo, e fu immediatamente soprannominata \"La Corvette dell'Inferno\". Era l'auto con l'accelerazione più rapida del paese e la seconda più veloce che si potesse acquistare in America. Ma non era un cavallo di razza, che batteva record per tempi sul giro, aderenza laterale e spazi di frenata utilizzando la tecnologia per migliorare le sue prestazioni. Il suo motore LT5 da 5,7 litri era progettato da Lotus, costruito da Mercury Marine e presentava 4 alberi a camme e 32 valvole, una caratteristica che nessuna Corvette aveva fino ai gemelli LT6/LT7 Gemini della C8.\n\nIn questa puntata, mettiamo a confronto la C4 ZR-1 con la Ferrari a motore centrale del momento, la 348 (e una Serie Speciale, per giunta). Le prestazioni non erano nemmeno lontanamente paragonabili: la Ferrari è un magnifico capolavoro di ingegneria, ma la Corvette la superava sotto ogni punto di vista.\n\n15 anni dopo arrivò la C6 Corvette ZR1, inizialmente conosciuta internamente come Blue Devil. Montava un motore LS9 V8 sovralimentato da 6,2 litri che erogava 638 CV. Ancora una volta, il logo ZR1 stava per \"ampiezza di banda\", il che significa che la ZR1 ha fatto tutto: ha battuto ancora una volta i record di maneggevolezza e frenata, e anche i tempi sul giro, con un record sul giro a Laguna Seca stabilito dal nostro pilota della SCCA Hall of Fame e co-conduttore Randy Pobst.\n\nLa C7 Corvette ZR1, arrivata 10 anni dopo, nacque in un'epoca diversa, in cui le Ferrari avevano acquisito i turbocompressori e avevano preso sul serio la velocità. La C7 ZR1 montava il motore LT5 da 6,2 litri, sovralimentato a 755 CV, per tenere il passo con le nuove Ferrari a motore centrale turbo, in particolare la 488. Nel tentativo di tenere il passo, la C7 si dimostrò difficile da gestire e decretò la fine delle Corvette a motore anteriore.\n\nLa C8 è una bestia completamente diversa e, con il suo V8 centrale con albero motore piatto e il cambio automatico a doppia frizione obbligatorio, ricorda da vicino la ricetta Ferrari. Che, ora, Lamborghini sta copiando con la prossima Temerario. Quindi, a tutti coloro che dicono che la C8 è una Ferrari americana, Jason suggerisce che è molto più simile a una Lamborghini americana: potenza assoluta e look sfacciato.\n\nE inoltre, la Ferrari si è allontanata, con la 296 GTB e GTS che utilizzano un V6 a 120° al posto del V8 con albero motore piatto ad alti regimi inventato dalla Ferrari.\n\nQuindi, come si posiziona la C8 ZR1? Guarda e scopri: 3 gare di accelerazione, molteplici power slide, drift, burnout e persino un po' di guida in città a bassa velocità. Affrontiamo tutto questo in questa pluripremiata serie ICONS.\n\nContattaci:\nSuggerimenti e feedback - videoquestions@hagerty.com\nRichieste stampa - press@hagerty.com\nRichieste di partnership - partnerships@hagerty.com"

On y retrouve également la Lamborghini Revuelto, la Ferrari 296 GTS et la Ferrari SF90. Avec Jason Cammisa et Randy Pobst, l'épisode propose également des courses d'accélération et des batailles sur circuit avec les Corvette ZR-1 C4, C6 ZR1 et C7 ZR1, ainsi qu'une Ferrari 348 Série Spéciale.\n\n===\nDEVIS D'ASSURANCE : Consultez https://hagerty.com/jason\n\nUN GRAND REMERCIEMENT à Falcon Car Rental ! https://falconcarrental.com\nUtilisez le code promo HAGERTY pour :\n5 % de réduction sur une location de 1 à 6 jours !\n20 % de réduction sur une location de 7 à 27 jours !\n35 % de réduction sur toute location de 28 jours ou plus !\n===\n\nLa toute nouvelle Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 2025 et 2026 développe 1 064 chevaux grâce à son V8 LT7 biturbo de 5,5 litres. Elle est équipée des plus gros turbocompresseurs jamais installés sur un moteur de voiture de série. Ce V8 à vilebrequin plat partage son architecture avec le LT6 atmosphérique de la Corvette Z06. La voiture d'essai de Cammisa, sans pack ZTK, bénéficie du kit aérodynamique optionnel, mais pas de la suspension de piste ni des pneus Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R de la Z06. Elle est chaussée de pneus Michelin Pilot Sport 4S (PS4S) avec une suspension plus souple, ce qui lui confère le statut de Corvette polyvalente.\n\nEt cela commence par la vitesse : sur le quart de mile, nous avons enregistré 9,8 secondes à 235 km/h, ce qui en fait (de loin) la voiture à deux roues motrices la plus rapide que nous ayons jamais testée.\n\nLe badge ZR1 signifie « Roi de la Colline » en langage Corvette et a été inventé pour équiper la Corvette C3 de compétition. En 1989, la Corvette ZR-1 de 1990 a été la première à arborer ce badge et a immédiatement été surnommée « La Corvette des Enfers ». C'était la voiture la plus rapide du pays, et la deuxième voiture la plus rapide du marché américain. Mais elle n'avait pas qu'un seul atout : elle a battu des records de temps au tour, d'adhérence latérale et de distances de freinage grâce à la technologie pour améliorer ses performances. Son moteur LT5 de 5,7 litres, conçu par Lotus et construit par Mercury Marine, comportait 4 arbres à cames et 32 soupapes, un atout qu'aucune Corvette ne possédait avant les bicylindres Gemini LT6/LT7 de la C8.\n\nDans cet épisode, nous affrontons la C4 ZR-1 face à la Ferrari à moteur central du moment, la 348 (et une Serie Speciale, en prime). Les performances étaient loin d'être au rendez-vous : la Ferrari est une magnifique pièce d'ingénierie, mais la Corvette la surpassait sur tous les plans.\n\nQuinze ans plus tard, la Corvette ZR1 C6, initialement connue en interne sous le nom de Blue Devil, était lancée. Elle était équipée d'un V8 LS9 suralimenté de 6,2 litres développant 638 ch. Une fois de plus, le logo ZR1 était synonyme de bande passante, signifiant que la ZR1 a tout donné : elle a une fois de plus battu des records de tenue de route, de freinage et de temps au tour, avec un record du tour à Laguna Seca établi par notre pilote de course intronisé au Temple de la renommée du SCCA et co-présentateur, Randy Pobst.\n\nLa Corvette ZR1 C7, arrivée dix ans plus tard, est née à une époque différente, où les Ferrari avaient adopté les turbocompresseurs et misaient sérieusement sur la vitesse. La C7 ZR1 utilisait le LT5 de 6,2 litres, suralimenté à 755 ch, pour rivaliser avec les Ferrari à moteur central turbocompressé, notamment la 488. Dans sa tentative de rivaliser, la C7 s'est avérée difficile à maîtriser et a sonné le glas de la Corvette à moteur avant.\n\nLa C8 est une toute autre bête. Avec son V8 central à vilebrequin plat et sa boîte automatique à double embrayage obligatoire, elle ressemble beaucoup à la recette de Ferrari. Lamborghini copie désormais cette recette avec la prochaine Temerario. Alors, à tous ceux qui prétendent que la C8 est une Ferrari américaine, Jason suggère qu'elle ressemble beaucoup plus à une Lamborghini américaine : une puissance impressionnante et une allure audacieuse.\n\nDe plus, Ferrari a changé de cap, avec les 296 GTB et GTS utilisant un V6 à 120 degrés au lieu du V8 à vilebrequin plat à haut régime inventé par Ferrari.\n\nAlors, comment se comporte la C8 ZR1 ? Regardez et découvrez : 3 courses d'accélération, de multiples dérapages, des dérapages, des burnouts et même de la conduite urbaine à basse vitesse.
