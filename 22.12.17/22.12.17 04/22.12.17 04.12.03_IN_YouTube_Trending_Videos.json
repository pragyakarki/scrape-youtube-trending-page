            "description": "India’s Hip-Hop superstars Ikka, Dino James & Badshah come together to channel their inner hopeless romanticism on ‘Woh.’ The track captures the immense hurt, emotions and male vulnerability which comes at the backdrop of a heartbreak. ‘Woh’ is one of the very few records which portray a man’s emotions with evocative honesty and reveals the softer side of him. Dino James pens down the difficulties behind missing someone that he has loved. He feels helpless and apologetic. Ikka feels his heart sinking as he is incapable of fixing the broken relationship and cannot deal with the heartache anymore. Badshah’s verse starts by asserting that it is okay for a man to break down and go through the gut-wrenching feeling of a fleeting romance. ‘Woh’ is an extremely personal track which is bound to shake you if you have ever loved someone.\n\nStream Now on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/track/1QUU43rTDMnGl4xyaIfsYN\nRecord Label - Def Jam India / Universal Music\n\n#Ikka #DinoJames #Badshah \n\n🎧 Audio Credits:\n➟ Track: WOH\n➟ Artist & Lyrics: Ikka x Dino James x Badshah\n➟ Music Producer: Aakash\n➟ Mixing & Mastering: Abhishek Ghatak\n \n🎬 Video Credits\n➟ Presented by Jimmy Enterprises\n➟ Produced by Shark & Ink Studios c/o Arjun Shah\n➟ Director - Himanshu Nisha Tyagi\n➟ Production Agency - Shareef Punndith Films\n➟ Executive Producers - Ashish Soni & Vivek B.

Music Producers: Aakash\n➟ Mixing & Mastering: Abhishek Ghatak\n➟ Lyric Video by: Flevi Harris for Neofox

Ikka]\n\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nAb uska pata nahi\nDil me jo rehta tha uski baaton ke\nAfsanay likhne baitha\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Chorus: Ikka]\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\nAb uska pata nahi\nDil me jo rehta tha uski baaton ke\nAfsanay likhne baitha\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Verse 1: Dino James]\n\nHa maine kari ye khata, liya mera side\nGalti chhupa ke, saare black ko kiya white\nMere bina she is dying, failaun main afwayein\nKaafi saara kehna, par pta nhi tu kahan hai\nJaise miss mai karu, baby you miss me kya?\nMere b'day mе beta tune wish nahi kiya\nDino Strong hai bta, ye tujhе kisne kaha\nKhair ab to jhelna padega, pain ye hisse ka\nKya purane apni chats ko tu karti hogi read\nKya tu type karke messages karti hogi delete\nKya tu bhi puchna chahti hai ki \"kaisa hai tu D\"\nKya tu bhi try kar rhi hai, are you trying to reach?\nTere Khayal me nahi hu, par tu khyal rakhna\nD sath me nahi thoda malal rakhna\nJo bhi tha mere pass vo hua exhaust\nVapis pyaar karne ki karu majal ab na, haan\n\n[Chorus: Ikka]\n\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Verse 2: Ikka]\n\nKhayal tera dil se mitaya nahi abhi\nTu gayi phir dil ye lagaya nahi kabhi\nBewafa maine tujhko bhulaya nahi abhi\nPyaar kiya bas tujhe ginwaya nahi kabhi\nBas gini barsaate or tere diye gam\nDil maane na ye baat ki ab sath nahi hum\nBhole baba thoda karo in kashton ko kam\nMere sath kaali raat or ek puri bottle Rum\nPuri Raat nahi sober, daaru badi pee hai\nYe jo mohabbat khayalo me hi jee hai\nHum to mare ja rhe hai milno ko\nKya tune bhi milne ki koshish kabhi ki hai?\nMeri yaad me tu royi, roti khayi tune nahi hai\nDosto ko bola mere baare bura nahi hai\nChhod ke tu gayi par banda khada vahi hai\nGalat bas hum woh to ladki hai to sahi hai\n\n[Chorus: Ikka]\n\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Verse 3: Badshah]\n\nYeah, jo dikhe na vo dard nahi kya?\nMahol ye sard nahi kya?\nAansun na dekhe aankhein hai kiski\nJo rota hai vo mard nahi kya?\nYe bata mujhe ki kon nahi rota\nMain hamare kamre me nahi sota\nLight band TV on nahi hota\nMain hu old school mujhse move on nahi hota\nJaane woh kaha gyi\nPehle bhi lade hai ye pehli dafa nahi\nPar kabhi aisi hui woh khafa nahi\nGalti hai meri, woh bewafa nahi (Woh bewafa nahi)\nMaine aisa kyu kiya\nPichle mahine cancel har show kiya\nKal flight me yuhi bethe bethe ro diya\nTere jane pe pata chala maine kya kho diya\n\n[Chorus: Ikka]\n\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\nAb uska pata nahi\nDil me jo rehta tha uski baaton ke\nAfsane likhne betha\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Outro: Dino James]\n\nRahu mai jese\nDooba dooba dooba sa\nSoona soona soona sa\nBhoola bhoola bhoola sa\nTere bin\n\nRahu mai jese\nDooba dooba dooba sa\nSoona soona soona sa\nBhoola bhoola bhoola sa\nTere bin\n\nLagu mai jese\nDooba dooba dooba sa\nSoona soona soona sa\nBhoola bhoola bhoola sa\nTere bin\n\nRahu mai jese\nDooba dooba dooba sa\nSoona soona soona sa\nBhoola bhoola bhoola sa\nTere

Ikka]\n\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nAb uska pata nahi\nDil me jo rehta tha uski baaton ke\nAfsanay likhne baitha\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Chorus: Ikka]\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\nAb uska pata nahi\nDil me jo rehta tha uski baaton ke\nAfsanay likhne baitha\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Verse 1: Dino James]\n\nHa maine kari ye khata, liya mera side\nGalti chhupa ke, saare black ko kiya white\nMere bina she is dying, failaun main afwayein\nKaafi saara kehna, par pta nhi tu kahan hai\nJaise miss mai karu, baby you miss me kya?\nMere b'day mе beta tune wish nahi kiya\nDino Strong hai bta, ye tujhе kisne kaha\nKhair ab to jhelna padega, pain ye hisse ka\nKya purane apni chats ko tu karti hogi read\nKya tu type karke messages karti hogi delete\nKya tu bhi puchna chahti hai ki \"kaisa hai tu D\"\nKya tu bhi try kar rhi hai, are you trying to reach?\nTere Khayal me nahi hu, par tu khyal rakhna\nD sath me nahi thoda malal rakhna\nJo bhi tha mere pass vo hua exhaust\nVapis pyaar karne ki karu majal ab na, haan\n\n[Chorus: Ikka]\n\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Verse 2: Ikka]\n\nKhayal tera dil se mitaya nahi abhi\nTu gayi phir dil ye lagaya nahi kabhi\nBewafa maine tujhko bhulaya nahi abhi\nPyaar kiya bas tujhe ginwaya nahi kabhi\nBas gini barsaate or tere diye gam\nDil maane na ye baat ki ab sath nahi hum\nBhole baba thoda karo in kashton ko kam\nMere sath kaali raat or ek puri bottle Rum\nPuri Raat nahi sober, daaru badi pee hai\nYe jo mohabbat khayalo me hi jee hai\nHum to mare ja rhe hai milno ko\nKya tune bhi milne ki koshish kabhi ki hai?\nMeri yaad me tu royi, roti khayi tune nahi hai\nDosto ko bola mere baare bura nahi hai\nChhod ke tu gayi par banda khada vahi hai\nGalat bas hum woh to ladki hai to sahi hai\n\n[Chorus: Ikka]\n\nHum to doobe hain\nUnki tasveeron me mile sukoon nahi\nUnke bin nindon me\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\nKya yaad mujhe bhi karti hogi woh?\n\n[Verse 3: Badshah]\n\nYeah, jo dikhe na vo dard nahi kya?\nMahol ye sard nahi kya?\nAansun na dekhe aankhein hai kiski\nJo rota hai vo mard nahi kya?\nYe bata mujhe ki kon nahi rota\nMain hamare kamre me nahi sota\nLight band TV on nahi hota\nMain hu old school mujhse move on nahi hota\nJaane woh kaha gyi\nPehle bhi lade hai ye pehli dafa nahi\nPar kabhi aisi hui woh khafa nahi\nGalti hai meri, woh bewafa

This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Shailesh Lodha), is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble.

Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu.
