ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

(Eh, eh, eh)\n\n[Verso 4]\nQué bonito chingarte y más rico y de noche\nUn palito en el aire y privado pa' Londres\nDiferentes mujeres de varios sabores\nNomás no te me aloques\nMujeriego y coqueto, tengo mil amores\nDe hace tiempo te busco, mas no sé ni en dónde\nSi me quieres, tendrás que aguantar los rumores\nNomás no te me aloques\n\n[Outro]\nEy\nFuerza Regida\nJajaja\n¿Ah?\nJaja\n\n#FuerzaRegida #TuSancho"

I say this bc im not thirsty for views on this channel, i wont clickbait, i wont force content, and i wont bring sponsors in on this channel and bring you guys more ads than you already watch. I upload on this channel strictly out of love. this leads to barebones no bs content on this channel. Just like NBA 2KLABs, which is a huge reason why i love that channel and what we do over there.  \n\n\nI specialize in Dribbling and offensive Movement. I Also won DPOY and money in competitive pro am leagues. i no longer play competitively as i just look to have the most fun possible playing casually for the most part. I give in depth tutorials and gameplay tips through my experiences playing NBA 2K over the years. with these YouTube Videos, i intend to make you guys better at the game so you can maximize your enjoyment playing this basketball game while cutting out the gimmicks. at the end of the day we just want to have a good time. \n\n\n2k25,2k 25,nba 2k25,nba2k25,nba 2k 25,nba2k 25,2k25 news,2k25 park,2k25 city,madden 25,2k25 parks,2k25 leaks,nba 2k25 pc,nba 2k25 new,nba 2k25 ps4,nba 2k25 ps5,2k25 builder,nba 2k25 news,nba 2k25 leak,2k25 trailer,nba 2k25 city,2k25 pro play,nba 2k25 park,nba 2k25 game,2k25 myplayer,2k25 gameplay,2k25 my career,nba 2k25 mynba,nba 2k25 cover,2k25 mycareer,mycareer 2k25,nba 2k25 leaks,nba 2k25 build,nba 2k25 badges. nba 2k25 nba 2k25 my career nba 2k25 gameplay nba 2k25 builder nba 2k25 news nba 2k25 trailer nba 2k25 demo nba 2k25 myteam nba 2k25 park nba 2k25 my player builder nba 2k25 rant nba 2k25 arcade edition nba 2k25 archetypes nba 2k25 android download nba 2k25 anthony Edwards nba 2k25 auction house nba 2k25 all star edition nba 2k25 allen Iverson nba 2k25 android nba 2k25 all city nba 2k25 ad angel reese nba 2k25 anthony edwards nba 2k25 nba 2k25 a'ja Wilson all nba 2k25 news nba 2k25 badges nba 2k25 bronny james nba 2k25 build nba 2k25 build system nba 2k25 breakdown nba 2k25 best build nba 2k25 badgeplug nba 2k25 best jumpshot nba 2k25 best dribble moves bronny james nba 2k25 best nba 2k25 build build nba 2k25 before you buy nba 2k25 builder nba 2k25 nba 2k25 cap breaker nba 2k25 current gen nba 2k25 cover nba 2k25 city nba 2k25 career mode nba 2k25 chris Smoove nba 2k25 classic teams nba 2k25 caitlin clark nba 2k25 crossplay chris smoove nba 2k2 caitlin clark nba 2k25 celtics nba 2k25 nba 2k25 dribble tutorial nba 2k25 dribble moves nba 2k25 dribbling nba 2k25 dallas mavericks nba 2k25 defense nba 2k25 dunk nba 2k25 dunk contest nba 2k25 early access nba 2k25 edition nba 2k25 early nba 2k25 early gameplay nba 2k25 everything we know nba 2k25 early tip off everything we know about nba 2k25 nba 2k25 hall of fame edition nba 2k25 my career ep 1 nba 2k25 flightreacts nba 2k25 face scan nba 2k25 face creation nba 2k25 features nba 2k25 franchise mode \n\n#nba2k25bestbuild #2k25bestbuild #2k25dribbletutorial #nba2k25dribbletutorial #2k25bestdribblemoves #2k25bestanimations #nba2k25bestanimations #nba2k25bestdribblemoves\n\nNBA 2K LABS DISCOUNT - https://www.nba2klab.com?fpr=koza42 OR CODE KOZA\nTWITCH LIVE STREAMS - https://www.twitch.tv/koza2k\nKICK LIVE STREAMS - https://kick.com/koza2k\n\nMUSIC BY -  https://ncs.io/\nMUSIC BY - PRODUCTION CRATE\n\nSong: Dosi & Aisake - Cruising [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds\nFree Download/Stream: http://ncs.io/Cruising\nWatch: http://ncs.lnk.to/CruisingAT/youtube\n\nSong: sumu - apart [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds\nFree Download/Stream: http://ncs.io/apart\nWatch: http://ncs.lnk.to/apartAT/youtube\n\nSong: Zaug - 8 Rounds [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds\nFree Download/Stream: http://ncs.io/8rounds\nWatch: http://ncs.lnk.to/8roundsAT/youtube",

I say this bc im not thirsty for views on this channel, i wont clickbait, i wont force content, and i wont bring sponsors in on this channel and bring you guys more ads than you already watch. I upload on this channel strictly out of love. this leads to barebones no bs content on this channel. Just like NBA 2KLABs, which is a huge reason why i love that channel and what we do over there.  \n\n\nI specialize in Dribbling and offensive Movement. I Also won DPOY and money in competitive pro am leagues. i no longer play competitively as i just look to have the most fun possible playing casually for the most part. I give in depth tutorials and gameplay tips through my experiences playing NBA 2K over the years. with these YouTube Videos, i intend to make you guys better at the game so you can maximize your enjoyment playing this basketball game while cutting out the gimmicks. at the end of the day we just want to have a good time. \n\n\n2k25,2k 25,nba 2k25,nba2k25,nba 2k 25,nba2k 25,2k25 news,2k25 park,2k25 city,madden 25,2k25 parks,2k25 leaks,nba 2k25 pc,nba 2k25 new,nba 2k25 ps4,nba 2k25 ps5,2k25 builder,nba 2k25 news,nba 2k25 leak,2k25 trailer,nba 2k25 city,2k25 pro play,nba 2k25 park,nba 2k25 game,2k25 myplayer,2k25 gameplay,2k25 my career,nba 2k25 mynba,nba 2k25 cover,2k25 mycareer,mycareer 2k25,nba 2k25 leaks,nba 2k25 build,nba 2k25 badges. nba 2k25 nba 2k25 my career nba 2k25 gameplay nba 2k25 builder nba 2k25 news nba 2k25 trailer nba 2k25 demo nba 2k25 myteam nba 2k25 park nba 2k25 my player builder nba 2k25 rant nba 2k25 arcade edition nba 2k25 archetypes nba 2k25 android download nba 2k25 anthony Edwards nba 2k25 auction house nba 2k25 all star edition nba 2k25 allen Iverson nba 2k25 android nba 2k25 all city nba 2k25 ad angel reese nba 2k25 anthony edwards nba 2k25 nba 2k25 a'ja Wilson all nba 2k25 news nba 2k25 badges nba 2k25 bronny james nba 2k25 build nba 2k25 build system nba 2k25 breakdown nba 2k25 best build nba 2k25 badgeplug nba 2k25 best jumpshot nba 2k25 best dribble moves bronny james nba 2k25 best nba 2k25 build build nba 2k25 before you buy nba 2k25 builder nba 2k25 nba 2k25 cap breaker nba 2k25 current gen nba 2k25 cover nba 2k25 city nba 2k25 career mode nba 2k25 chris Smoove nba 2k25 classic teams nba 2k25 caitlin clark nba 2k25 crossplay chris smoove nba 2k2 caitlin clark nba 2k25 celtics nba 2k25 nba 2k25 dribble tutorial nba 2k25 dribble moves nba 2k25 dribbling nba 2k25 dallas mavericks nba 2k25 defense nba 2k25 dunk nba 2k25 dunk contest nba 2k25 early access nba 2k25 edition nba 2k25 early nba 2k25 early gameplay nba 2k25 everything we know nba 2k25 early tip off everything we know about nba 2k25 nba 2k25 hall of fame edition nba 2k25 my career ep 1 nba 2k25 flightreacts nba 2k25 face scan nba 2k25 face creation nba 2k25 features nba 2k25 franchise mode \n\n#nba2k25bestbuild #2k25bestbuild #2k25dribbletutorial #nba2k25dribbletutorial #2k25bestdribblemoves #2k25bestanimations #nba2k25bestanimations #nba2k25bestdribblemoves\n\nNBA 2K LABS DISCOUNT - https://www.nba2klab.com?fpr=koza42 OR CODE KOZA\nTWITCH LIVE STREAMS - https://www.twitch.tv/koza2k\nKICK LIVE STREAMS - https://kick.com/koza2k\n\nMUSIC BY -  https://ncs.io/\nMUSIC BY - PRODUCTION CRATE\n\nSong: Dosi & Aisake - Cruising [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds\nFree Download/Stream: http://ncs.io/Cruising\nWatch: http://ncs.lnk.to/CruisingAT/youtube\n\nSong: sumu - apart [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds\nFree Download/Stream: http://ncs.io/apart\nWatch: http://ncs.lnk.to/apartAT/youtube\n\nSong: Zaug - 8 Rounds [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds\nFree Download/Stream: http://ncs.io/8rounds\nWatch: http://ncs.lnk.to/8roundsAT/youtube"

            "description": "We are BACK at the Casino, doing the BIGGEST Group Pull on Slots EVER.  We’ve got Lady Luck HQ, TheBigJackpot, omfg_slots, and myself risking THOUSANDS.  8 People versus the High-Limit slots room, let’s CRUSH it for millions of dollars! Thank you all so much for liking, subscribing, and dropping your thoughts in the comments. Even if you’re roasting me—I still love you. You’re all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war.\n\nSpecial shoutout to @LadyLuckHQ @TheBigJackpot ​⁠@JackpotJonny @omfg_slots for the collab\n\nBrettski adjusted his lucky hat as he stepped into the neon glow of the Grand Royale Casino. Beside him, YouTube’s slot royalty had assembled: Lady Luck, exuding calm confidence; Raja, grinning with anticipation; OMFG\\_Slots, live-streaming every step; and Jackpot Johnny, already cracking jokes. Together, they pooled \\$12,000 for the wildest group slot session of their lives.\n\nThe target? One. Million. Dollars.\n\nThey started on high-limit Dragon Link. The reels spun like wildfire. Raja landed a \\$3,000 bonus early, electrifying the group. OMFG\\_Slots screamed into his mic, “THIS IS IT!” But ten spins later, the machine turned cold. They moved to Buffalo Gold, then Lightning Cash — wins and losses see-sawed like a rollercoaster.\n\nAt \\$7,000 left, Lady Luck whispered, “One machine. One bet. Max volume.” Jackpot Johnny nodded toward a \\$250/spin Cleopatra II in the High-Limit Room. “That one. Feels cursed. I like it.”\n\nThey fed \\$4,000 in. Dead spins. Nerves frayed. On the last \\$250 spin, BOOM — bonus triggered.\n\nFree spins exploded with multipliers. Cheers erupted as the balance climbed: \\$5,000… \\$20,000… then a full screen of Cleopatras with 6x multiplier. The machine froze. Lights flashed. A slot attendant ran over.\n\n“You just hit \\$986,000.”\n\nOMFG\\_Slots dropped his phone. Brettski stared in disbelief. “We’re \\$14,000 from a million.”\n\nJohnny grinned. “One more spin?”\n\nLady Luck hesitated. “It’s not smart…”\n\nBut Raja was already walking toward *The Vault*, an exclusive machine known for huge jackpots — and huge losses.\n\nThey pooled \\$10,000. One spin. Brettski pushed the button.\n\nThe reels spun.\n\nOne symbol…\n\nTwo symbols…\n\nThen — the screen glitched.\n\nThe machine powered off.\n\nA siren blared.\n\nSecurity swarmed.\n\nThe manager approached with a grim face.\n\n“Step away from the machine. We need to talk.”\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED…**\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination.",

            "description": "roblox is DISGUSTING... (Schlep Roblox Lawsuit Drama EXPLAINED)\n\nSo recently Roblox Drama YouTuber Schlep known for his Pred Catching series on Roblox 'To Catch a Robloxian', where he collaborates with Ruben Sim, Jidion and more, was BANNED off of Roblox and THREATENED with a Lawsuit after Schlep received a CEASE AND DESIST from the Roblox Corporation. The Roblox Schlep Lawsuit / Ban Drama has gone VIRAL with many Large YouTuber's covering the Schlep Roblox Moderation Situation such as Charlie / MoistCritical, KreekCraft, Ruben Sim, Jidion and others. Roblox is now THREATENING to BAN other Roblox YouTubers including myself with their new HORRIBLE roblox moderation policies which Schlep had called them out for before. Since my last video Roblox RESPONDED by Octodupling down trying to justify them banning schlep using the worst reasoning possible. In this video I talk about how Legal channels are now covering the situation including roblox's brand new moderation \n\nMake sure to Leave a LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to help as many people as possible be made aware and informed/educated on this situation!

(Schlep Roblox Lawsuit Drama EXPLAINED)\n\nSo recently Roblox Drama YouTuber Schlep known for his Pred Catching series on Roblox 'To Catch a Robloxian', where he collaborates with Ruben Sim, Jidion and more, was BANNED off of Roblox and THREATENED with a Lawsuit after Schlep received a CEASE AND DESIST from the Roblox Corporation. The Roblox Schlep Lawsuit / Ban Drama has gone VIRAL with many Large YouTuber's covering the Schlep Roblox Moderation Situation such as Charlie / MoistCritical, KreekCraft, Ruben Sim, Jidion and others. Roblox is now THREATENING to BAN other Roblox YouTubers including myself with their new HORRIBLE roblox moderation policies which Schlep had called them out for before. Since my last video Roblox RESPONDED by Octodupling down trying to justify them banning schlep using the worst reasoning possible.
