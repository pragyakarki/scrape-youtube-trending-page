            "description": "As new questions arise about Boeing’s troubled 737 Max jet, FRONTLINE and The New York Times update an award-winning investigation into the design, oversight and production of a plane that was involved in two crashes that killed 346 people.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​\n\nIn October 2018, a Boeing 737 Max passenger jet crashed shortly after takeoff off the coast of Indonesia. Five months later, following an eerily similar flight pattern, another 737 Max 8 went down in Ethiopia. Everyone on board the flights died.\n\n\"Boeing's Fatal Flaw\" tells the inside story of what led up to the crashes — revealing how intense market pressure and failed oversight contributed to tragic deaths and a catastrophic crisis for one of the world’s most iconic industrial names.\n\nThis updated documentary also examines what’s happened since the original film first aired in 2021, including the January 2024 Alaska Airlines incident where a panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max jet’s body midair, and how Boeing has responded.\n\nExplore additional reporting related to \"Boeing’s Fatal Flaw\" on our website: \nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/boeings-fatal-flaw/\n\n#Documentary #Boeing #737Max #AirlineSafety\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.

He would two-putt for birdie.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh\r\n\r\nThe PGA TOUR’s Florida swing continues as Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club & Lodge hosts the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard. This event is the second of three player-hosted invitationals (along with Tiger Woods’ The Genesis Invitational and Jack Nicklaus’ the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday). ­World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler will be in the field this week. The American has gone T4-1-T15 in his last three Arnold Palmer Invitational starts and hasn’t finished worse than T17 in his last five TOUR starts – including three straight top-10s. Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up in Florida this week. He’s had past success here claiming victory in 2018 and finishing runner-up two years ago. The Northern Irishman has also made nine out of nine cuts and claimed six top-10s previously in this event. Reigning FedExCup champion Viktor Hovland is also back in action this week. Hovland last teed it up at The Genesis Invitational where he finished tied for 19th. He has recorded back-to-back top-10 results at Bay Hill, including a runner-up in 2022.

According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” said Mann. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024.\n \nDisney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, “Inside Out 2” releases only in theaters Summer 2024.",

I really want to go home\nAnd all these beautiful people are making me feel like a fugly little gnome\n\nDanny: I feel the same way\nTom: Really?\nDanny: Yeah, I hate parties\nTom: I hate them too\nMichelle: Play some music!\nTom: Oy, I’m not the goddamn DJ, Michelle!

            "description": "You might remember the legendary song and meme sensation that was crab rave. Well imagine if the creator of that song became a game dev and made a video game where you Claw your way across exotic islands combining fluid movement with fast paced combat to become a Crab Champion in this third person shooter with roguelike elements. Ok you don't need to imagine the game is here and its called Crab Champions. However this is a special game. Unlike most games the developer of this one really wants you to actually break their game. This game wants to be broken. So what makes crab champions so special. This game features stats and skills that can be stacked and modified in a way that lets the player manipulate the gameplay to exploit, glitch and bug your way to becoming overpowered. In this video I will showcase a god mode immortality glitch, an infinite money glitch and an infinite damage glitch. All that and more because this game is oh so perfect for an exploiter like The Spiffing Brit! \n\nYou can currently grab Crab Champions On a steam sale here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/774801/Crab_Champions/\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:46 - Starting our run\n04:15 - Exploiting the shops!\n06:06 - Science with Spiff!\n08:06 - Improving our luck even further\n11:12 - The final biome!\n14:45 - Defeat the boss!\n16:38 - Machine gun crab\n21:29 - Science with Spiff S01E02\n23:43 - The return of King Skull!\n24:19 - Outro & Thanks for Watching!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts.

                "description": "You might remember the legendary song and meme sensation that was crab rave. Well imagine if the creator of that song became a game dev and made a video game where you Claw your way across exotic islands combining fluid movement with fast paced combat to become a Crab Champion in this third person shooter with roguelike elements. Ok you don't need to imagine the game is here and its called Crab Champions. However this is a special game. Unlike most games the developer of this one really wants you to actually break their game. This game wants to be broken. So what makes crab champions so special. This game features stats and skills that can be stacked and modified in a way that lets the player manipulate the gameplay to exploit, glitch and bug your way to becoming overpowered. In this video I will showcase a god mode immortality glitch, an infinite money glitch and an infinite damage glitch.

He’s a giant monstrous purple cat-like creature who roams the halls of Playcare - and he’s AWESOME. He has glowing eyes and has the ability to breathe out a hallucinogenic red gas. As soon as we saw him, we knew we had to turn him into a huge custom animatronic. \n\nWe made the frame of our Catnap animatronic with PVC pipes and built up the shape of his body using wires and duct tape. Catnap’s giant head was custom sculpted out of XPS foam, and his whole body was covered in short purple fur. His back arches up and down with the help of a wiper motor, his head turns side to side using a servo. and he even breathes out red smoke (aka Poppy Gas) thanks to a hidden microfogger in his chest.\n\nWe love how our real life Catnap turned out! He’s going to make to the perfect companion to our animatronic Huggy Wuggy and Springtrap animatronics. Who do you want to see us make next?\n\nThanks for watching and Stay Wicked, y’all!\n\n#CatNap \n#PoppyPlaytime\n#Animatronics",

He’s a giant monstrous purple cat-like creature who roams the halls of Playcare - and he’s AWESOME. He has glowing eyes and has the ability to breathe out a hallucinogenic red gas. As soon as we saw him, we knew we had to turn him into a huge custom animatronic. \n\nWe made the frame of our Catnap animatronic with PVC pipes and built up the shape of his body using wires and duct tape. Catnap’s giant head was custom sculpted out of XPS foam, and his whole body was covered in short purple fur. His back arches up and down with the help of a wiper motor, his head turns side to side using a servo. and he even breathes out red smoke (aka Poppy Gas) thanks to a hidden microfogger in his chest.\n\nWe love how our real life Catnap turned out! He’s going to make to the perfect companion to our animatronic Huggy Wuggy and Springtrap animatronics. Who do you want to see us make next?\n\nThanks for watching and Stay Wicked, y’all!\n\n#CatNap \n#PoppyPlaytime\n#Animatronics"

            "title": "Why US elections only give you two choices",
            "description": "We don’t like the two-party system. So why do we have it?\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nAmerica’s two-party system is widely hated. Very few Americans think the two major parties do an adequate job representing us, and most say more parties are needed. But when it comes time to vote, very few of us actually vote for third-party candidates. Often, this is explained as either a failure of will (we’d have third parties if more people would just vote for them), or a conspiracy (the political and media establishments suppress third-party candidates and ideas).\n\nAnd it’s not that those things aren’t true. But there’s a much simpler explanation, and it’s the very basic rule governing almost every single one of our elections: Only one person can win. If you’re American, that probably sounds utterly reasonable: what the hell other kinds of elections even are there? But the answer is: lots. Winner-take-all elections (also called plurality voting, or “first past the post”) are actually a practice that most advanced democracies left behind long ago — and they’re what keep us from having more political options.\n\nEven if you’re not sold on the need for more parties in the US, though, scratch the surface of “only one person can win” a little and you start to see how it actually produces perverse results within the two-party system as well. It’s a big part of why the political parties have moved farther apart from each other, and it leaves about half of the country without any political representation at all.

                "description": "We don’t like the two-party system. So why do we have it?\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nAmerica’s two-party system is widely hated. Very few Americans think the two major parties do an adequate job representing us, and most say more parties are needed. But when it comes time to vote, very few of us actually vote for third-party candidates. Often, this is explained as either a failure of will (we’d have third parties if more people would just vote for them), or a conspiracy (the political and media establishments suppress third-party candidates and ideas).\n\nAnd it’s not that those things aren’t true. But there’s a much simpler explanation, and it’s the very basic rule governing almost every single one of our elections: Only one person can win. If you’re American, that probably sounds utterly reasonable: what the hell other kinds of elections even are there? But the answer is: lots. Winner-take-all elections (also called plurality voting, or “first past the post”) are actually a practice that most advanced democracies left behind long ago — and they’re what keep us from having more political options.\n\nEven if you’re not sold on the need for more parties in the US, though, scratch the surface of “only one person can win” a little and you start to see how it actually produces perverse results within the two-party system as well. It’s a big part of why the political parties have moved farther apart from each other, and it leaves about half of the country without any political representation at all.
