            "description": "When you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you. Joker: Folie À Deux – only in theaters and IMAX, October 4. #JokerMovie #FilmedForIMAX \n\nFrom acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes “Joker: Folie À Deux,” the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019’s Academy Award-winning “Joker,” which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.  The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar winner Lady Gaga (“A Star Is Born”).\n\n“Joker: Folie À Deux” finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (“The Banshees of Inisherin”) and Catherine Keener (“Get Out,” “Capote”), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from “Joker.”\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing “Joker,” directed “Joker: Folie À Deux” from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC.  The film was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner.  Lady Gaga served as music consultant.  The film’s executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg and Jason Ruder.\n\nWorking with Phillips behind the camera are his team from “Joker,” including Oscar-nominated director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberg, Oscar-nominated editor Jeff Groth, and composer Hildur Guđnadóttir, who won the Oscar for her work on the first film.  New to the team is Oscar-nominated costume designer Arianne Phillips (“Once Upon a Time in… Hollywood,” “Don’t Worry Darling”).  Ruder is the film’s executive music producer and the music supervisors are Randall Poster and George Drakoulias.  Casting is by Francine Maisler (the “Dune” films, “Challengers”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents A Joint Effort Production, A Film by Todd Phillips, “Joker: Folie À Deux.”  The film will be released worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, and will be only in theaters nationwide on October 4, 2024, and beginning internationally on 2 October, 2024.",

Now, years have passed and despite rumours of the struggling theme park finally closing down in 2024, they defied all expectations and indeed re-opened... however they did so in a very bizarre state.

Oscar-nominated, singular creative visionary Tim Burton and Oscar nominee and star Michael Keaton reunite for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the long-awaited sequel to Burton’s award-winning Beetlejuice.  \n\nKeaton returns to his iconic role alongside Oscar nominee Winona Ryder (Stranger Things, Little Women) as Lydia Deetz and two-time Emmy winner Catherine O’Hara (Schitt$ Creek, The Nightmare Before Christmas) as Delia Deetz, with new cast members Justin Theroux (Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi, The Leftovers), Monica Bellucci (Spectre, The Matrix films), Arthur Conti (House of the Dragon) in his feature film debut, with Emmy nominee Jenna Ortega (Wednesday, Scream VI) as Lydia’s daughter, Astrid, and Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (Poor Things, At Eternity’s Gate).\n\nBeetlejuice is back!  After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River.  Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened.  With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice's name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.\n\nBurton, a genre unto himself, directs from a screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (Wednesday), story by Gough & Millar and Seth Grahame-Smith (The LEGO® Batman Movie), based on characters created by Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson.  The film’s producers are Marc Toberoff, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Tommy Harper and Burton, with Sara Desmond, Katterli Frauenfelder, Gough, Millar, Brad Pitt, Larry Wilson, Laurence Senelick, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary, Anthony Tittanegro, Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg executive producing.\n\nBurton’s creatives behind the scenes includes director of photography Haris Zambarloukos (Meg 2: The Trench, Murder on the Orient Express); such previous and frequent collaborators as production designer Mark Scruton (Wednesday), editor Jay Prychidny (Wednesday), Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood (Alice in Wonderland, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Sleepy Hollow), Oscar-winning creature effects and special makeup FX creative supervisor Neal Scanlan (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and Oscar-nominated composer Danny Elfman (Big Fish, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman); and Oscar-winning hair and makeup designer Christine Blundell (Topsy-Turvy).\n\nA Warner Bros.

Enter coupon code searchparty for 4 months EXTRA at https://surfshark.deals/searchparty\n\nThe Olympics are in a crisis – no one wants to host the Games anymore. After decades of fierce competitions, only 2 cities ended up in contention for the 2024 Games; Paris and LA. Worried that no one would bid for 2028, the Olympics gave them both a Games. This video will use economic data, archive, and expert analysis to explain how the most prestigious sporting event in the world got too far over its skis and how it plans to get cities interested in hosting again.\n\nSpecial thanks to Andrew Zimbalist.\n\nWelcome to Search Party!\nSearch Party is a new, independent, video news show that combines experienced journalism and visual design to decode the most complex stories in international sports and geopolitics.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: https://www.youtube.com/@Search-Party\n\nBecome a Search Party Original member today: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7KbIaEOuY7H2j-cvhJ3mYA/join\n\nAbout:\nSearch Party is led and produced by Sam Ellis, a journalist, director, editor, and animator based in New York City.

Enter coupon code searchparty for 4 months EXTRA at https://surfshark.deals/searchparty\n\nThe Olympics are in a crisis – no one wants to host the Games anymore. After decades of fierce competitions, only 2 cities ended up in contention for the 2024 Games; Paris and LA. Worried that no one would bid for 2028, the Olympics gave them both a Games. This video will use economic data, archive, and expert analysis to explain how the most prestigious sporting event in the world got too far over its skis and how it plans to get cities interested in hosting again.\n\nSpecial thanks to Andrew Zimbalist.\n\nWelcome to Search Party!\nSearch Party is a new, independent, video news show that combines experienced journalism and visual design to decode the most complex stories in international sports and geopolitics.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: https://www.youtube.com/@Search-Party\n\nBecome a Search Party Original member today: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7KbIaEOuY7H2j-cvhJ3mYA/join\n\nAbout:\nSearch Party is led and produced by Sam Ellis, a journalist, director, editor, and animator based in New York City.

            "description": "Maia Stern | July 17, 2024\nTrey Anastasio is no stranger to the Tiny Desk, having performed a solo set in 2015. Bassist Mike Gordon and drummer Jon Fishman also performed for our Tiny Desk (home) concert series in 2020 with guitarist Leo Kottke. And now, finally, we get a full Phish Tiny Desk concert.\n\nThe set began with “Sigma Oasis,” which included a little musical reference to the All Things Considered theme song. The band continued with “Evolve,” a track from its 16th studio album released last week. Before the band’s final song, Anastasio and Gordon warmed up their fingers on tiny trampolines, which likely had the uninitiated scratching their heads. But for fans of this band, it was a clear signal of what was coming next: “You Enjoy Myself,” a song that dates back to the band’s beginnings and can safely be called a Phish classic. In live performances, the jam segment features choreographed bouncing, and the band brought that spectacle right into our office.\n\nAfter, the band ended its set and swerved out slowly through the crowd, singing while giving out high fives. But the audience's applause didn’t stop, so Phish came back out and played two bonus tracks: “Sample in a Jar” and “Chalk Dust Torture.” “When we started the band, we used to practice in a room exactly this size… it was probably smaller,” Anastasio shared. What a gift to get to watch Phish perform in a similarly sized room 41 years later.\n\nSET LIST\n“Sigma Oasis”\n“Evolve”\n“You Enjoy Myself”\n“Sample in a Jar”\n“Chalk Dust Torture”\n\nMUSICIANS\nTrey Anastasio: guitar, lead vocals\nMike Gordon:  bass, vocals\nJon Fishman: drums, vocals\nPage McConnell: keys, vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer/Director: Maia Stern \nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.
