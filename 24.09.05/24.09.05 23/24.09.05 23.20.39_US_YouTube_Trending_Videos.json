Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time.\n\nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge.\n\nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival!

            "description": "Marlon Wayans joins Shannon Sharpe at Club Shay Shay for an honest conversation about life, comedy, and family. Marlon, the youngest of the Wayans siblings, reflects on growing up as the \"butt\" of his family's jokes. He shares how his childhood was shaped by his mom's hands-on approach and his father's strict religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness. He talks about how his mom foresaw New York real estate's value skyrocketing and recounts wearing hand-me-downs from his brothers—a habit he's kept up even today.\n\nMarlon dives deep into his upbringing, recalling how different his family was from others in the neighborhood because they had both a mother and a father. He recounts having legendary entertainers like Eddie Murphy and Robert Townsend visit his home, and how he was writing sketches from a young age. Marlon also discusses the tension with his father over attending a performance arts high school and eventually leaving Howard University because of his experience with professors treating him differently due to In Living Color.\n\nHe opens up about his career in comedy, from his early auditions for his brother's movie Mo' Money to the creation of The Wayans Bros TV show with his brother Shawn. Marlon reflects on his family being labeled with nepotism despite their immense talent and discusses the challenges they faced with networks, including their decision to leave In Living Color when NBC attempted to blackball his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans. He gives credit to Keenen's talent-spotting abilities, noting how Keenen discovered major stars like Tommy Davidson, Jim Carrey, and Jennifer Lopez, and he reminisces about the legendary four-year run of In Living Color, which even led to the invention of the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nMarlon shares stories about his experiences in Hollywood, like working with Eddie Murphy on Norbit, his close friendship with Tupac Shakur during the filming of Above the Rim, and how the tragic deaths of Tupac and Biggie impacted him. He discusses the origins of The Wayans Bros show and remembers some of their best guests, including Bernie Mac, whom they helped elevate to stardom.\n\nHe gets into the complexities of Hollywood, discussing his family's challenges with the Weinstein brothers and how they were cheated out of a fair deal for the Scary Movie franchise. He reflects on the impact of being a visionary Black entertainer and the importance of coming together to create rather than tear each other down.\n\nMarlon talks about some of the iconic moments in his career, such as the making of White Chicks, which he describes as the hardest movie he's ever done. He responds to claims from Mo'Nique that White Chicks stole her baby powder joke, and addresses criticism about Black actors wearing dresses in Hollywood. He also shares his unique approach to comedy, stating that he doesn't write his jokes but performs spontaneously, \"like Jay-Z in the booth.\"\n\nIn a more personal segment, Marlon opens up about his relationship with his daughter and the difficulties of accepting her transition. He discusses his desire to have another child in his 50s, his reluctance to get married, and how he plans to be a different father this time around.\n\nTune in to this episode of Club Shay Shay for a raw and insightful conversation with Marlon Wayans, filled with laughter, love, and some unexpected revelations.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #marlonwayans #wayansbros \n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

                "title": "Marlon Wayans' Hollywood Stories & Mo'Nique Saying The Wayans Bros Stole Her Joke In White Chicks",
                "description": "Marlon Wayans joins Shannon Sharpe at Club Shay Shay for an honest conversation about life, comedy, and family. Marlon, the youngest of the Wayans siblings, reflects on growing up as the \"butt\" of his family's jokes. He shares how his childhood was shaped by his mom's hands-on approach and his father's strict religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness. He talks about how his mom foresaw New York real estate's value skyrocketing and recounts wearing hand-me-downs from his brothers—a habit he's kept up even today.\n\nMarlon dives deep into his upbringing, recalling how different his family was from others in the neighborhood because they had both a mother and a father. He recounts having legendary entertainers like Eddie Murphy and Robert Townsend visit his home, and how he was writing sketches from a young age. Marlon also discusses the tension with his father over attending a performance arts high school and eventually leaving Howard University because of his experience with professors treating him differently due to In Living Color.\n\nHe opens up about his career in comedy, from his early auditions for his brother's movie Mo' Money to the creation of The Wayans Bros TV show with his brother Shawn. Marlon reflects on his family being labeled with nepotism despite their immense talent and discusses the challenges they faced with networks, including their decision to leave In Living Color when NBC attempted to blackball his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans. He gives credit to Keenen's talent-spotting abilities, noting how Keenen discovered major stars like Tommy Davidson, Jim Carrey, and Jennifer Lopez, and he reminisces about the legendary four-year run of In Living Color, which even led to the invention of the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nMarlon shares stories about his experiences in Hollywood, like working with Eddie Murphy on Norbit, his close friendship with Tupac Shakur during the filming of Above the Rim, and how the tragic deaths of Tupac and Biggie impacted him. He discusses the origins of The Wayans Bros show and remembers some of their best guests, including Bernie Mac, whom they helped elevate to stardom.\n\nHe gets into the complexities of Hollywood, discussing his family's challenges with the Weinstein brothers and how they were cheated out of a fair deal for the Scary Movie franchise. He reflects on the impact of being a visionary Black entertainer and the importance of coming together to create rather than tear each other down.\n\nMarlon talks about some of the iconic moments in his career, such as the making of White Chicks, which he describes as the hardest movie he's ever done. He responds to claims from Mo'Nique that White Chicks stole her baby powder joke, and addresses criticism about Black actors wearing dresses in Hollywood. He also shares his unique approach to comedy, stating that he doesn't write his jokes but performs spontaneously, \"like Jay-Z in the booth.\"\n\nIn a more personal segment, Marlon opens up about his relationship with his daughter and the difficulties of accepting her transition. He discusses his desire to have another child in his 50s, his reluctance to get married, and how he plans to be a different father this time around.\n\nTune in to this episode of Club Shay Shay for a raw and insightful conversation with Marlon Wayans, filled with laughter, love, and some unexpected revelations.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #marlonwayans #wayansbros \n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West. \n \nThe film also stars Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n \nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots), and a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman). \n \nDirected by acclaimed filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 26, 2025.\n \nWicked is produced by Marc Platt (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar® nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are David Nicksay, Stephen Schwartz and Jared LeBoff. \n \nBased on the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked is adapted for the screen by the stage production’s book writer Winnie Holzman and by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The Broadway stage musical is produced by Universal Stage Productions, Marc Platt, the Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone.",

I upload on this channel strictly out of love. this leads to barebones no bs content on this channel. Just like NBA 2KLABs, which is a huge reason why i love that channel and what we do over there.  \n\n\nI specialize in Dribbling and offensive Movement. I Also won DPOY and money in competitive pro am leagues. i no longer play competitively as i just look to have the most fun possible playing casually for the most part. I give in depth tutorials and gameplay tips through my experiences playing NBA 2K over the years. with these YouTube Videos, i intend to make you guys better at the game so you can maximize your enjoyment playing this basketball game while cutting out the gimmicks. at the end of the day we just want to have a good time. \n\n\n2k25,2k 25,nba 2k25,nba2k25,nba 2k 25,nba2k 25,2k25 news,2k25 park,2k25 city,madden 25,2k25 parks,2k25 leaks,nba 2k25 pc,nba 2k25 new,nba 2k25 ps4,nba 2k25 ps5,2k25 builder,nba 2k25 news,nba 2k25 leak,2k25 trailer,nba 2k25 city,2k25 pro play,nba 2k25 park,nba 2k25 game,2k25 myplayer,2k25 gameplay,2k25 my career,nba 2k25 mynba,nba 2k25 cover,2k25 mycareer,mycareer 2k25,nba 2k25 leaks,nba 2k25 build,nba 2k25 badges. nba 2k25 nba 2k25 my career nba 2k25 gameplay nba 2k25 builder nba 2k25 news nba 2k25 trailer nba 2k25 demo nba 2k25 myteam nba 2k25 park nba 2k25 my player builder nba 2k25 rant nba 2k25 arcade edition nba 2k25 archetypes nba 2k25 android download nba 2k25 anthony Edwards nba 2k25 auction house nba 2k25 all star edition nba 2k25 allen Iverson nba 2k25 android nba 2k25 all city nba 2k25 ad angel reese nba 2k25 anthony edwards nba 2k25 nba 2k25 a'ja Wilson all nba 2k25 news nba 2k25 badges nba 2k25 bronny james nba 2k25 build nba 2k25 build system nba 2k25 breakdown nba 2k25 best build nba 2k25 badgeplug nba 2k25 best jumpshot nba 2k25 best dribble moves bronny james nba 2k25 best nba 2k25 build build nba 2k25 before you buy nba 2k25 builder nba 2k25 nba 2k25 cap breaker nba 2k25 current gen nba 2k25 cover nba 2k25 city nba 2k25 career mode nba 2k25 chris Smoove nba 2k25 classic teams nba 2k25 caitlin clark nba 2k25 crossplay chris smoove nba 2k2 caitlin clark nba 2k25 celtics nba 2k25 nba 2k25 dribble tutorial nba 2k25 dribble moves nba 2k25 dribbling nba 2k25 dallas mavericks nba 2k25 defense nba 2k25 dunk nba 2k25 dunk contest nba 2k25 early access nba 2k25 edition nba 2k25 early nba 2k25 early gameplay nba 2k25 everything we know nba 2k25 early tip off everything we know about nba 2k25 nba 2k25 hall of fame edition nba 2k25 my career ep 1 nba 2k25 flightreacts nba 2k25 face scan nba 2k25 face creation nba 2k25 features nba 2k25 franchise mode nba 2k25 first look nba 2k25 free to play nba 2k25 flight nba 2k25 first look trailer nba 2k25 free flightreacts nba 2k25\n\n#nba2k25bestbuild #2k25bestbuild #2k25dribbletutorial #nba2k25dribbletutorial #2k25bestdribblemoves #2k25bestanimations #nba2k25bestanimations #nba2k25bestdribblemoves\n\nNBA 2K LABS DISCOUNT - https://www.nba2klab.com?fpr=koza42 OR CODE KOZA\nTWITCH LIVE STREAMS - https://www.twitch.tv/koza2k\nKICK LIVE STREAMS - https://kick.com/koza2k\n\nMUSIC BY - PRODUCTION CRATE",

The game features a variety of alien characters, each with different abilities such as robot legs for high jumps and diamond skin for enhanced damage absorption. One of the groups within the game is known as the Freegunners, who are mercenaries. Some of the game mechanics include special equipment like healing pads and trip mines, which persist not only between deaths but also across rounds. Five playable characters unveiled are: Vale, Haymar, Star Child, Lennox, and the robot 1-Off. At launch, the game will feature 16 characters. The game will also have free post-launch updates that will add more characters, maps, vignettes, and more. Every week, the game will feature new vignettes that will show what Concord‘s characters are up to outside of gameplay in the Concord galaxy. The vignettes will tell an ongoing story, with characters receiving their own narrative arcs.\n~ Wikipedia\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n╔═╦╗╔╦╗╔═╦═╦╦╦╦╗╔═╗\n║╚╣║║║╚╣╚╣╔╣╔╣║╚╣═╣ \n╠╗║╚╝║║╠╗║╚╣║║║║║═╣\n╚═╩══╩═╩═╩═╩╝╚╩═╩═╝\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe and I'll be your bestest friend!\n#gaming #ps5 #playstation"

            "description": "Fox Sports’ lead College Football analyst Joel Klatt reacts to a wild first week of the season. He discusses the teams that impressed him the most including Notre Dame after their huge road win at Texas A&M. He also breaks down the impact of USC’s come-from-behind win over LSU on the Big Ten and Playoff Picture. Miami and Georgia made early-season statements while Clemson continues to fall further from the top teams in the sport, but Klatt reveals why the lack of transfers isn’t the biggest reason for their downturn. Klatt considers whether Penn State is ready to take the next step following an impressive win at West Virginia. Michigan’s win over Fresno State was more difficult than their fans had hoped but Klatt thinks expectations for this team need to be reset while drawing comparisons to previous teams in the Harbaugh era. Colorado and Coach Prime also won their opener with star performances from Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter but were there warning signs of issues that could hurt them down the road?

                "description": "Fox Sports’ lead College Football analyst Joel Klatt reacts to a wild first week of the season. He discusses the teams that impressed him the most including Notre Dame after their huge road win at Texas A&M. He also breaks down the impact of USC’s come-from-behind win over LSU on the Big Ten and Playoff Picture. Miami and Georgia made early-season statements while Clemson continues to fall further from the top teams in the sport, but Klatt reveals why the lack of transfers isn’t the biggest reason for their downturn. Klatt considers whether Penn State is ready to take the next step following an impressive win at West Virginia. Michigan’s win over Fresno State was more difficult than their fans had hoped but Klatt thinks expectations for this team need to be reset while drawing comparisons to previous teams in the Harbaugh era. Colorado and Coach Prime also won their opener with star performances from Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter but were there warning signs of issues that could hurt them down the road?

With Kelsey Mitchell having one of her best games. Unfortunately a great game of basketball was overshadowed by more Sheryl Swoopes controversy, who can't seem to stop mentioning Caitlin Clark in a negative way.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO MY 2ND CHANNEL (SOCCER/FOOTBALL)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_qKMHj0ge-rqYqb0HYgN9g\n\nFOLLOW MY TWITTER \nhttps://twitter.com/DKM_Sports\n\nFOLLOW ME OVER ON TWITCH FOR LIVESTREAMS!\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/dkm_yt\n\nCLICK HERE TO JOIN THE DISCORD COMMUNITY SERVER\nhttps://discord.com/invite/Zp5YvZa\n\n*Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­-to-­be­-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”).

                "description": "Days after a fatal crash involving an F-16, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fired the head of the country's air force, Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk.\n\nThe Ukrainian fighter pilot, known as \"Moonfish,\" died in the crash Monday during a Russian missile attack. Oleksiy Mes' death is a major blow to Ukraine, as he was just one of six Ukrainian air force pilots qualified to fly an F-16, which started arriving in the country in early August.\n\n“We need to protect people. Protect personnel. Take care of all our soldiers,” Zelenskyy said, according to an Associated Press translation of an address made after the official order.\n\nMore here: https://www.scrippsnews.com/world/ukrainian-f-16-pilot-killed-during-russian-missile-attack\n\nPhoto:  Efrem Lukatsky/AP\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nJoin our newsletter at https://bit.ly/2q1tepr\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/scrippsnews\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/scrippsnews/\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@scrippsnews"
