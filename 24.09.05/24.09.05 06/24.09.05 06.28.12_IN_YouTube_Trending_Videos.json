Her aunt keeps her around because she has a share in the family's property.\nSalar, the son of a wealthy businessman, is passionate about photography, which often earns him criticism from his family. With a pure heart, Salar is known for evading his responsibilities.\nAt her cousin's wedding, Sitara wrongly assumes Salar is the photographer. Salar develops a soft spot for Sitara after seeing how poorly she is treated. However, due to a conspiracy, objections arise about their closeness. Salar, once again, avoids the issue, leaving Sitara to face doubts from her own family.\nCan Sitara prove she’s not guilty? Will Salar help her avoid further mistreatment? Will her family support Sitara? Can Salar show he genuinely cares?

Spread the word.\n\nKaffara Episode 38 - [Eng Sub] - Ali Ansari - Laiba Khan - Zoya Nasir - 3rd September - HAR PAL GEO\n\nSitara, a lively orphan living with her brother, aunt, and uncle, finds joy in life's small things despite her aunt's poor treatment. Her aunt keeps her around because she has a share in the family's property.\nSalar, the son of a wealthy businessman, is passionate about photography, which often earns him criticism from his family. With a pure heart, Salar is known for evading his responsibilities.\nAt her cousin's wedding, Sitara wrongly assumes Salar is the photographer. Salar develops a soft spot for Sitara after seeing how poorly she is treated. However, due to a conspiracy, objections arise about their closeness. Salar, once again, avoids the issue, leaving Sitara to face doubts from her own family.\nCan Sitara prove she’s not guilty? Will Salar help her avoid further mistreatment? Will her family support Sitara? Can Salar show he genuinely cares? Will there be more plots against Sitara?\n\n7th Sky Entertainment Presentation \nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi \nDirector: Muhammad Iftikhar Iffi\nWriter: Shafia Khan\n\nCast :\nAli Ansari as Salar\nLaiba Khan as Sitara\nZoya Nasir as Nimi \nAliya Ali as Saba\nYasir Shoro as Salman\nJunaid Akhtar as Ehtisham\nFawad Jalal as Junaid\nRaeed Muhammad Alam as Qasim\nZohreh Amir as Zoya\nSadaf Aashan as Shahida\nRashid Farooqui as Shaukat\nBakhtawar Khan as Sahiba\nAnnie Zaidi as Mehreen\nUsman Peerzada as Tahir\nReham Rafiq as Kiran\nNazlee Nasr as Najma\nMohsin Gillani as Mirza Sahab\nShaheen Khan as Suraiya\nSami Khan as Zohaib\nSajida Syed as Zaira\nFareeha Jabeen as Khala Bi\nShabana Shaikh as Zehra\n\n#kaffara \n#laibakhan \n#aliansari"
