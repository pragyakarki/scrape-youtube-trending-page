            "description": "Be There and Be Square. #MinecraftMovie - only in theaters 2025\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, “A Minecraft Movie,” directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time.\n\nThe film also stars Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”), with Jennifer Coolidge.\n\nWelcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival!  Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination.  To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black).  Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. \n\nOscar nominee Hess (“Ninety-Five Senses,” “Nacho Libre”) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing.\n\nThe director’s creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (“127 Hours,” “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “The Meg”), editor James Thomas (“Pokémon: Detective Pikachu”, the “Borat” films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (“The Jungle Book,” “The Batman”), and costume designer Amanda Neale (“The Meg,” “What We Do in the Shadows”).  Casting is by Rachel Tenner.  The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (“Thor: Ragnarok,” the “LEGO®” movies).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Mojäng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, “A Minecraft Movie.”  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025.",

From her wooden kitchen with a dedicated baking station to an orchard in the backyard, it’s easy to forget Garner lives among the hustle and bustle of LA. “I wanted it to feel old and cool and historic, but I also wanted to make it work for a big family with a lot of things going on.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Jennifer Garner's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/step-inside-jennifer-garners-cozy-california-home\r\n\r\nShop pieces inspired by Jennifer Garner’s Cozy California Home: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/shopping/jennifer-garner-open-door\r\n\r\n00:00 Intro\r\n00:17 Living Room\r\n02:00 Kitchen\r\n03:09 Dining Room\r\n03:50 Library\r\n04:54 Orchard\r\n05:56 Vegetable House\r\n06:17 Pool Area\r\n06:53 Landing\r\n07:20 Reading Nook\r\n07:59 Primary Bedroom\r\n08:41 Primary Bathroom\r\n09:21 Slumber Party Room\r\n\r\n'Formia’ stone sculpture by Ole Mynster at Ruby Atelier\r\nPhotography by Lara Porzak\r\nStained Glass by Judson Studios, Reed Bradley\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

                "description": "While he was testifying, Kenneth \"Lil Woody\" Copeland tried to ask rapper rapper Young Thug if he ever had an issue with another rapper Rich Homie Quan. However, Copeland was quickly stopped by prosecutor Simone Hylton. Woody admitted to playing a part in shooting up the barbershop of Rich Homie Quan's dad.\n\nSubscribe to Law&Crime Trials for More Courtroom Coverage: https://bit.ly/LawAndCrimeTrials\n\nWatch More Young Thug Trial Clips: https://bit.ly/YoungThugTrial\n\nYoung Thug faces nearly a dozen charges, including possession of drugs and weapons, participation in criminal street gang activity, and conspiracy to violate Georgia’s RICO Act. The rapper was arrested in May of 2022 along with 27 other alleged gang members. Many of those defendants have taken plea deals in the case.\n\n#LawAndCrime #KennethCopeland #LilWoody \n\nSTAY UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LAW&CRIME NETWORK:\nWatch Law&Crime Network on YouTubeTV: https://bit.ly/3td2e3y\nWhere To Watch Law&Crime Network: https://bit.ly/3akxLK5\nSign Up For Law&Crime's Daily Newsletter: https://bit.ly/LawandCrimeNewsletter\nRead Fascinating Articles From Law&Crime Network: https://bit.ly/3td2Iqo\n\nFor Licensing Inquiries, Please Contact: licensing@lawandcrime.com\n\nLAW&CRIME NETWORK SOCIAL MEDIA:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lawandcrime/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LawCrimeNetwork\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lawandcrime\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/lawandcrimenetwork\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@lawandcrime\n\nLAW&CRIME NETWORK PODCASTS: https://lawandcrime.com/podcasts/\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ALL OF LAW&CRIME NETWORK YOUTUBE CHANNELS:\nMain Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz8K1occVvDTYDfFo7N5EZw\nLaw&Crime Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVXOqoOCYbi-iXChKAl6DTQ\nChannel B: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXCLaaClAWQiTkl3pw9ZdLw\nChannel C: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMV3pzWIhJGLYzoHyxBjjNw"

I say this bc im not thirsty for views on this channel, i wont clickbait, i wont force content, and i wont bring sponsors in on this channel and bring you guys more ads than you already watch. I upload on this channel strictly out of love. this leads to barebones no bs content on this channel. Just like NBA 2KLABs, which is a huge reason why i love that channel and what we do over there.  \n\n\nI specialize in Dribbling and offensive Movement. I Also won DPOY and money in competitive pro am leagues. i no longer play competitively as i just look to have the most fun possible playing casually for the most part. I give in depth tutorials and gameplay tips through my experiences playing NBA 2K over the years. with these YouTube Videos, i intend to make you guys better at the game so you can maximize your enjoyment playing this basketball game while cutting out the gimmicks. at the end of the day we just want to have a good time. \n\n\n2k25,2k 25,nba 2k25,nba2k25,nba 2k 25,nba2k 25,2k25 news,2k25 park,2k25 city,madden 25,2k25 parks,2k25 leaks,nba 2k25 pc,nba 2k25 new,nba 2k25 ps4,nba 2k25 ps5,2k25 builder,nba 2k25 news,nba 2k25 leak,2k25 trailer,nba 2k25 city,2k25 pro play,nba 2k25 park,nba 2k25 game,2k25 myplayer,2k25 gameplay,2k25 my career,nba 2k25 mynba,nba 2k25 cover,2k25 mycareer,mycareer 2k25,nba 2k25 leaks,nba 2k25 build,nba 2k25 badges. nba 2k25 nba 2k25 my career nba 2k25 gameplay nba 2k25 builder nba 2k25 news nba 2k25 trailer nba 2k25 demo nba 2k25 myteam nba 2k25 park nba 2k25 my player builder nba 2k25 rant nba 2k25 arcade edition nba 2k25 archetypes nba 2k25 android download nba 2k25 anthony Edwards nba 2k25 auction house nba 2k25 all star edition nba 2k25 allen Iverson nba 2k25 android nba 2k25 all city nba 2k25 ad angel reese nba 2k25 anthony edwards nba 2k25 nba 2k25 a'ja Wilson all nba 2k25 news nba 2k25 badges nba 2k25 bronny james nba 2k25 build nba 2k25 build system nba 2k25 breakdown nba 2k25 best build nba 2k25 badgeplug nba 2k25 best jumpshot nba 2k25 best dribble moves bronny james nba 2k25 best nba 2k25 build build nba 2k25 before you buy nba 2k25 builder nba 2k25 nba 2k25 cap breaker nba 2k25 current gen nba 2k25 cover nba 2k25 city nba 2k25 career mode nba 2k25 chris Smoove nba 2k25 classic teams nba 2k25 caitlin clark nba 2k25 crossplay chris smoove nba 2k2 caitlin clark nba 2k25 celtics nba 2k25 nba 2k25 dribble tutorial nba 2k25 dribble moves nba 2k25 dribbling nba 2k25 dallas mavericks nba 2k25 defense nba 2k25 dunk nba 2k25 dunk contest nba 2k25 early access nba 2k25 edition nba 2k25 early nba 2k25 early gameplay nba 2k25 everything we know nba 2k25 early tip off everything we know about nba 2k25 nba 2k25 hall of fame edition nba 2k25 my career ep 1 nba 2k25 flightreacts nba 2k25 face scan nba 2k25 face creation nba 2k25 features nba 2k25 franchise mode nba 2k25 first look nba 2k25 free to play nba 2k25 flight nba 2k25 first look trailer nba 2k25 free flightreacts nba 2k25\n\n#nba2k25bestbuild #2k25bestbuild #2k25dribbletutorial #nba2k25dribbletutorial #2k25bestdribblemoves #2k25bestanimations #nba2k25bestanimations #nba2k25bestdribblemoves\n\nNBA 2K LABS DISCOUNT - https://www.nba2klab.com?fpr=koza42 OR CODE KOZA\nTWITCH LIVE STREAMS - https://www.twitch.tv/koza2k\nKICK LIVE STREAMS - https://kick.com/koza2k\n\nMUSIC BY - PRODUCTION CRATE",

            "description": "Fox Sports’ lead College Football analyst Joel Klatt reacts to a wild first week of the season. He discusses the teams that impressed him the most including Notre Dame after their huge road win at Texas A&M. He also breaks down the impact of USC’s come-from-behind win over LSU on the Big Ten and Playoff Picture. Miami and Georgia made early-season statements while Clemson continues to fall further from the top teams in the sport, but Klatt reveals why the lack of transfers isn’t the biggest reason for their downturn. Klatt considers whether Penn State is ready to take the next step following an impressive win at West Virginia. Michigan’s win over Fresno State was more difficult than their fans had hoped but Klatt thinks expectations for this team need to be reset while drawing comparisons to previous teams in the Harbaugh era. Colorado and Coach Prime also won their opener with star performances from Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter but were there warning signs of issues that could hurt them down the road?

From my First Class suite, to the onboard dining and facilities onboard. This has not come cheap, with a ticket price of over $2000 dollars but as usual i’ll provide my honest opinion of the experience. \n\nUnfortunately as the title suggests, the expectation vs reality was quite something. We'll try the various food outlets onboard, both speciality and included, take a look at the outdoor pools of which there are two and of course check out the spa facilities. I'll also take a look at the entry and mid level rooms so you can compare these to my suite. \n\n0:00 - Introduction\n4:17 - Suite tour\n7:46 - Steakhouse\n14:25 - Library \n16:19 - Outside decks\n22:42 - Main Dining \n24:53 - Cost",

From my First Class suite, to the onboard dining and facilities onboard. This has not come cheap, with a ticket price of over $2000 dollars but as usual i’ll provide my honest opinion of the experience. \n\nUnfortunately as the title suggests, the expectation vs reality was quite something. We'll try the various food outlets onboard, both speciality and included, take a look at the outdoor pools of which there are two and of course check out the spa facilities. I'll also take a look at the entry and mid level rooms so you can compare these to my suite. \n\n0:00 - Introduction\n4:17 - Suite tour\n7:46 - Steakhouse\n14:25 - Library \n16:19 - Outside decks\n22:42 - Main Dining \n24:53 - Cost"

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­-to-­be­-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”).

            "description": "A new era is born.\n\nNext summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, breakthrough talent Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an intrepid team racing to secure DNA samples from the three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure genetic material from the world’s three most massive dinosaurs. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on an island where they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that’s been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team leader; Emmy nominee and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of this summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

                "title": "Jurassic World Rebirth",
                "description": "A new era is born.\n\nNext summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, breakthrough talent Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an intrepid team racing to secure DNA samples from the three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air. Also starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure genetic material from the world’s three most massive dinosaurs. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on an island where they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that’s been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team leader; Emmy nominee and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of this summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer."

            "description": "Tyrese Gibson joins Shannon Sharpe in this episode of Club Shay Shay for an unfiltered and insightful conversation that dives deep into his life, career, and the experiences that have shaped him.\n\nThe episode starts on a playful note as Tyrese humorously tells Shannon he needs to moisturize, setting the tone for a lively discussion. The two reminisce over a glass of Coca-Cola, with Tyrese sharing the story behind his iconic Coke commercial—a defining moment that skyrocketed his career. He reveals how he arrived late to the audition but still managed to land the role, earning his first $100 and feeling like it was Christmas every day since.\n\nThe conversation takes a deeper turn as Tyrese discusses his challenging childhood, being the youngest of four children and the only one not born in St. Louis. He shares how his family moved to LA for his father’s singing career, only for his father to leave when Tyrese was just seven years old. He opens up about his mother’s struggles with alcoholism and her belief that he was special from birth.\n\nIn discussing his film career, Tyrese talks about his latest movie 1992, a project that faced significant hurdles in Hollywood. He shares how Snoop Dogg, the film’s executive producer, played a pivotal role in generating buzz for the movie. Tyrese praises Snoop as a genius who has reinvented himself time and time again, noting that Snoop’s influence is unmatched—even more so than Jay-Z’s. He also mentions how actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis continually reinvent themselves, and how working with Denzel is a dream he has yet to fulfill, as Denzel is the very reason he pursued acting.\n\nTyrese and Shannon also discuss having haters from your own neighborhood like Nipsey Hussle. Then the focus shifts to the power of social media, with Tyrese noting that it has made lying more popular while highlighting that Denzel Washington avoids rumors by staying off social platforms. He humorously recalls the internet clapping back at Shannon for his tote bag and his infamous “two-hour-old” Air Force 1s, showcasing Tyrese’s sharp wit and playful nature.\n\nThe conversation touches on Katt Williams’ memorable appearance on Club Shay Shay, with Tyrese calling him “Prophet Williams” and discussing the impact of Katt’s truth-telling, even when it’s uncomfortable. Tyrese talks about his ongoing joke with Akon and Ludacris about being dark-skinned and how communities like Jewish, Latino, and Asian people are more unified, though Black culture remains the most influential.\n\nTyrese delves into the complexities of relationships, marriage, and the differences between men and women’s expectations, themes that are also explored in his latest album. He speaks about the importance of genuine friendships, especially in environments like Watts, and how the loyalty of his friends kept him on the right path.\n\nFinally, Tyrese reflects on the role of hardship in shaping his identity, asserting that he has no regrets because every struggle has sculpted him into the man he is today. He recounts his mother's scheme to pretend he had special needs for more government money and shares his thoughts on fame, privacy, and his refusal to let negative experiences define him.\n\nThis episode is a masterclass in resilience, humor, and the art of storytelling, as Tyrese Gibson opens up like never before, providing listeners with a raw and inspiring look into his life and career.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #tyresegibson #shannonsharpe\n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

                "title": "Tyrese Gibson On Katt Williams Being a Prophet & Shannon Sharpe's Viral Orange Birkin Bag",
                "description": "Tyrese Gibson joins Shannon Sharpe in this episode of Club Shay Shay for an unfiltered and insightful conversation that dives deep into his life, career, and the experiences that have shaped him.\n\nThe episode starts on a playful note as Tyrese humorously tells Shannon he needs to moisturize, setting the tone for a lively discussion. The two reminisce over a glass of Coca-Cola, with Tyrese sharing the story behind his iconic Coke commercial—a defining moment that skyrocketed his career. He reveals how he arrived late to the audition but still managed to land the role, earning his first $100 and feeling like it was Christmas every day since.\n\nThe conversation takes a deeper turn as Tyrese discusses his challenging childhood, being the youngest of four children and the only one not born in St. Louis. He shares how his family moved to LA for his father’s singing career, only for his father to leave when Tyrese was just seven years old. He opens up about his mother’s struggles with alcoholism and her belief that he was special from birth.\n\nIn discussing his film career, Tyrese talks about his latest movie 1992, a project that faced significant hurdles in Hollywood. He shares how Snoop Dogg, the film’s executive producer, played a pivotal role in generating buzz for the movie. Tyrese praises Snoop as a genius who has reinvented himself time and time again, noting that Snoop’s influence is unmatched—even more so than Jay-Z’s. He also mentions how actors like Denzel Washington and Viola Davis continually reinvent themselves, and how working with Denzel is a dream he has yet to fulfill, as Denzel is the very reason he pursued acting.\n\nTyrese and Shannon also discuss having haters from your own neighborhood like Nipsey Hussle. Then the focus shifts to the power of social media, with Tyrese noting that it has made lying more popular while highlighting that Denzel Washington avoids rumors by staying off social platforms. He humorously recalls the internet clapping back at Shannon for his tote bag and his infamous “two-hour-old” Air Force 1s, showcasing Tyrese’s sharp wit and playful nature.\n\nThe conversation touches on Katt Williams’ memorable appearance on Club Shay Shay, with Tyrese calling him “Prophet Williams” and discussing the impact of Katt’s truth-telling, even when it’s uncomfortable. Tyrese talks about his ongoing joke with Akon and Ludacris about being dark-skinned and how communities like Jewish, Latino, and Asian people are more unified, though Black culture remains the most influential.\n\nTyrese delves into the complexities of relationships, marriage, and the differences between men and women’s expectations, themes that are also explored in his latest album. He speaks about the importance of genuine friendships, especially in environments like Watts, and how the loyalty of his friends kept him on the right path.\n\nFinally, Tyrese reflects on the role of hardship in shaping his identity, asserting that he has no regrets because every struggle has sculpted him into the man he is today. He recounts his mother's scheme to pretend he had special needs for more government money and shares his thoughts on fame, privacy, and his refusal to let negative experiences define him.\n\nThis episode is a masterclass in resilience, humor, and the art of storytelling, as Tyrese Gibson opens up like never before, providing listeners with a raw and inspiring look into his life and career.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #tyresegibson #shannonsharpe\n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

mind\nWell I saw him walk in\nWith his cowboy hat\nAnd I thought to myself\nI could use some of that\nHis boots like glass on a saw dust floor\nHad moves like nothin’ I’d ever seen before\nSo I walked right up\nI pulled him to the side\nI handed him a beer and looked him right in the eye\nAnd I said “Baby, I think you’re gonna wanna hear this”\nI said\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m ready to leave\nAnd you look like you love me\n\nWell I was down at the local beer joint with a few of the guys \nWhen this cute little country girl caught my eye \nAnd boy let me tell you she was the prettiest thing i’d ever seen in a pair of boots\nWell she walked right up to me, handed me a beer \nGave me a look like, lets get outta here \nAnd that's when I realized that she was every cowboys dream come true \nShe told me this right here, she said..\n\nExcuse me,\nYou look like you love me\nYou look like you want me\nTo want you to come on home\nAnd baby I don’t blame you\nFor lookin’ me up and down across this room\nI’m drunk and I’m
