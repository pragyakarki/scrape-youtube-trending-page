Khumar explores the complexities of love in the face of societal expectations and challenges. Faiz and Hareem, two individuals from different backgrounds, find their lives connected by destiny.\n\nFaiz, born into an affluent family, contrasts sharply with Hareem, who hails from a\nlower-middle-class background. Despite their differences, fate weaves their paths together. Hareem, diligently working to make ends meet amid her brother Rufi's educational needs and her mother's medical expenses, faces numerous hurdles. In the midst of her struggles, Faiz, a friend of Rufi's, silently supports them financially and even gets work for Hareem, albeit discreetly.\n\nHareem's family doesn't know that Faiz loves her, leading to a one-sided love affair. Faiz's love for Hareem remains a secret, but his mother disapproves of his association with Hareem's family due to the significant class difference. But fate decides to play its tune, and an unexpected event turns the lives of Faiz and Hareem upside down.\n\nWhat was this surprising turn of events that changed everything for Faiz and Hareem? Will the gap in their social status keep them apart? Can Faiz convince his mother to accept Hareem? If they marry, can they create a happy life together despite their different backgrounds and mindsets?\n\n7th Sky Entertainment Presentation \nProducers: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi \nWriter: Maha Malik\nDirector: Ali Faizan\n\nCast:\nFeroze Khan as Faiz\nNeelam Muneer as Hareem\nHina Bayat as Kehkasha Begum\nAsma Abbas as Durdana\nBehroz Sabzwari as Sheikh Furqan\nZainab Qayoom as Dil Araa\nShehryar Zaidi as Taufeeq\nAdnan Samad as Nasir\nSheherzade Peerzada as Hamna  \nMinsa Malik as Laiba \nKinza Malik as Atiya\nMehmood Akhtar as Zaawar  \nAgha Mustafa as Rayyan  \nHamzah Tariq as Rufi\nAyesha Rajpoot as Shagufta\nMizna Waqas as Husna\nSohail Masood as Mirza Sahab\nBirjees Farooqui as Salma\n\n#HappilacPaints \n#ColorsofHappiness\n\n#Khumar\n#FerozeKhan\n#NeelamMuneer",

But this was one of the best and the most memorable days of my life. \nMastermind or the planner was Jeema, a kind-hearted follower of mine who turned out to be a very dear and close friend. Coordinated with the rest of my friends. Her cute home-baked mommy Cake. I didn’t want to cut it as it was too cute to look at. And her son Jain who joined was a silent partner ♥️\nNifla, as usual with her amazing food and drinks. Shilja with her home-baked brownies which I couldn’t get a photo of as it got over soon. Sneha, Naina, and Shilja with their lovely gift from Victoria’s Secret.\n\nIt was such a surprise cum shock to see this coming. I can’t get over it as I am still in the shower mode 😃….\nThank you my dear ladies for this cute sweet and most memorable day in my life. I will cherish this forever 😍😍😍😍\n\n@niflaub @naina170390 @menon3020 @shiljavinay & Jeema ♥️\n.\n.\n.\n#surprise #babyshower #bestday #friendsforever #memorable",

At the center of this age-old vendetta are Darwesh Khan, Duraab Khan, and his son Channar Khan, with Zamdaa, the daughter of Darwesh, bearing the heaviest consequences.  \nDarwesh Khan is haunted by his father's murder at the hands of Duraab Khan. Seeking a peaceful life, Darwesh aims to broker a truce to end generational enmity. However, suspicions arise, and Duraab Khan and his son Channar Khan doubt Darwesh's intentions for peace.\nDespite the genuine efforts of Darwesh, a kind-hearted man with a message for peace, a tragic turn of events unfolds during a celebration at Darwesh's home, causing immense suffering for Zamdaa and her family.\nWill Zamdaa bow down in front of her enemies? If not, then will Zamdaa be able to take revenge on her family culprits? Will Zamdaa find allies in her journey, or will she face her enemies alone?\n\nWritten By: Saqlain Abbas\nDirected By: Syed Wajahat Hussain\nProduced By: Abdullah Kadwani & Asad Qureshi\nProduction House: 7th Sky Entertainment\n\nCast:\nFaysal Quraishi as Channar Khan\nDurefishan Saleem as Zamdaa\nKhalid Butt as Duraab Khan \nNoor ul Hassan as Darwesh \nUzma Hassan as Gul Wareen\nLaila Wasti as Bareera\nOsama Tahir as Badal\nShuja Asad as Barlas \nMah-e-Nur Haider as Apana \nShamyl Khan as Gulab Khan \nHina Bayat as Bakhtawar \nSaba Faisal as Husn Bano \nJaved Jamal as Badshah Khan \nNabeel Zuberi as Pamir \nHassan Noman as Shanawar\n\n#Sparxsmartphones \n#shinewithsparx\n\n#Khaie\n#FaysalQuraishi\n#DurefishanSaleem"
