            "description": "This is the definitive review of the 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, a feature-length documentary on the history of the Mustang that now includes its direct rival: the BMW M4 Competition.\n\n==\nThis episode of “Jason Cammisa on the ICONS” is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-ICONS\n=\n\nSomewhere between a video review and a documentary, Jason Cammisa on the ICONS is the highest-quality car review on the planet. This episode features the S650 Mustang Dark Horse, a first-generation 1966 Mustang Convertible, second-generation Mustang II, third-generation Fox-Body Mustang, SN95 Mustang, S197 Mustang Boss 302, and Cammisa's own footage from his reviews of the S550-chassis Shelby GT350 and GT500.\n\nBut in a twist, it also includes a first-generation Ford Probe GT, a B1-chassis Volkswagen Fox, an E30-chassis BMW M3, and of course, today's G82-chassis BMW M4 Competition.\n\nSCCA Hall of Fame race car driver, Randy Pobst, sets a lap time around Chuckwalla in the Mustang Dark Horse and M4 Competition, as Jason breaks an axle doing reverse donuts in a front-wheel-drive Ford Probe — which was supposed to replace the Mustang entirely.\n\n===\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

This episode features the S650 Mustang Dark Horse, a first-generation 1966 Mustang Convertible, second-generation Mustang II, third-generation Fox-Body Mustang, SN95 Mustang, S197 Mustang Boss 302, and Cammisa's own footage from his reviews of the S550-chassis Shelby GT350 and GT500.\n\nBut in a twist, it also includes a first-generation Ford Probe GT, a B1-chassis Volkswagen Fox, an E30-chassis BMW M3, and of course, today's G82-chassis BMW M4 Competition.\n\nSCCA Hall of Fame race car driver, Randy Pobst, sets a lap time around Chuckwalla in the Mustang Dark Horse and M4 Competition, as Jason breaks an axle doing reverse donuts in a front-wheel-drive Ford Probe — which was supposed to replace the Mustang entirely.\n\n===\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

            "description": "Bobby Carter | December 18, 2023\nScarface's Tiny Desk concert radiates with his decadeslong passion as an emcee and producer. There's calculated intent behind every word and note of this 30-minute set and I learned that his love for golf also runs deep during our initial meeting. He was playing a round and had difficulty dividing his attention between the plan and the course. Three days before the show, amid rehearsals, I got a call from Facemob asking, \"What if I brought Mike Dean?\" My expectations were already high, but that final addition set the stage for something special.\n\nMike Dean provided unmatched authenticity, and their shared stories added sentimental value to this performance. After all, his signature keys and synths can be heard on most of Scarface's classics and countless Rap-A-Lot records. Here, we get a rare glimpse of Scarface the conductor, bouncing through multiple eras of his catalog including \"On My Block,\" \"Mary Jane\" and the bone-chilling \"I Seen a Man Die.\"\n\nScarface, along with Rakim, was recently awarded the inaugural Hip-Hop Grandmaster Award from the newly launched Paid in Full Foundation, which includes a sizable financial prize and healthcare. No matter how the never-ending hip-hop greats debate is sliced, the rapper's place is cemented as one of the most influential storytellers in the culture and his Tiny Desk is proof.\n\nSET LIST\n\"On My Block\"\n\"Mary Jane\"\n\"Smile\"\n\"I Seen a Man Die\"\n\"F**k Faces\"\n\"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nScarface: lead vocals, guitar\nMike Dean: keys\nSteven \"Spud\" Howard: vocals\nTakai \"Cookie\" Hicks: vocals \nPeigh Jones: vocals, guitar \nCorey \"FunkaFingers\" Stoot: guitar \nJosh Henderson: keys\nJason \"The Bishop\" Allen: keys\nSavar Martin: drums \nAnthony \"Antboogie\" Nicholson: bass, musical direction \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Maia Stern\nEditor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Alanté Serene, Michael Zamora\nAudio Assistant: Ted Mebane\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Elizabeth Gillis\nTiny Desk Team: Suraya Mohamed, Kara Frame, Hazel Cills\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #scarface",

Jesus said this to a crowd of thousands before also saying it to Simon while they stood on water. Season 4? Jesus is weary and heavy-laden, and He needs rest.\n\nWe're getting closer and closer to Jerusalem, to what we know is coming. Jesus is getting increasingly frustrated, and yes, sad. Not because he's getting closer to death, but because of the reasons He must die. From his faith's religious leaders, to the holy city of Jerusalem, to his own friends and followers, people are not understanding his mission. To that end, He must allow painful things, and even set in motion certain confusing or bittersweet events, to accelerate the outcomes that will lead to Holy Week. \n\nSeason 4 marks the midpoint of the most famous and influential story in human history. It will be painful, and it will be joyous. It will be bittersweet. But by all measures, Season 4 will also be our best.\n\n- Dallas Jenkins, Creator of The Chosen",

Sadot's Super News 🎮💥\"\n\n🌌 Durag Nation, brace yourselves for a major update on the Insomniac Games hack, arguably the worst leak in gaming history. Skip the intros - we're diving straight into this critical situation. If you value this kind of urgent gaming news, smash that like button or hit dislike as you see fit. Let's get into it. 🎮🔔\n\n🔹 'Insomniac Games Under Siege': First, a shoutout to the team at Insomniac, who are facing a tough time with both their hard work being compromised and personal employee information leaked. This isn't just about the games; it's about real people behind them whose lives are at risk. 🚨👥\n\n🔹 'Massive Scale of the Leak': The hackers demanded a ransom and even hosted an auction for the stolen data. After a week, they released most of what they had - over 1 million files, totaling 1.6 terabytes. This includes everything from employee passports to the licensing agreement between Marvel Games and Insomniac. 📛📂\n\n🔹 'Targeted Attack on Insomniac and Sony': The hackers' intention was purely monetary, choosing Insomniac and Sony as they believed gaming companies would be easy targets. They accessed the network in under 30 minutes, and the fallout is catastrophic. 💰🕹️\n\n🔹 'Impact on Insomniac’s Future Plans': Every plan Insomniac had for the next decade is now exposed, including budgets, release years, and identities of upcoming games. 'Marvel’s Wolverine' has been particularly hit hard, with gameplay, cutscenes, and the entire story leaked. 🌐🎮\n\n🔹 'Comparisons to GTA 6 Leak': While GTA 6 suffered a leak of early test footage, the scale of Insomniac's breach is unparalleled. This could potentially lead to a major reshuffle of 'Marvel’s Wolverine', especially its storyline. 🎭🔍\n\n🔹 'Protecting Employees and Bolstering Security': The primary focus now is ensuring the safety of affected employees and significantly upgrading Sony's security to prevent future incidents. This leak will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the gaming industry. 🔐🛡️\n\nYou would have to mute everything related to Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, Venom, The X-Men, and Wolverine to avoid spoilers\n\n#wolverineps5 #wolverine #MarvelsWolverine #InsomniacGames #GamingNews #PlayStation5 #SpiderMan2 #marvel",

            "description": "HELLO FRIENDS!! This week we’re taking a 52-hour Amtrak sleeper train across the country! So, I've fallen over to the \"overnight sleeper train\" side of youtube - and I am HOOKED, people. And after watching hours and hours of train content, I decided - it was time to try my own hand at it. So we took the California Zephyr train, which travels from San Francisco to Chicago (and also the other direction as well) - across 7 states and over 2,400 miles!! We experienced everything from delays to endless sauce packets to MANY rock sightings. Would you try traveling across the US by train? And where do you think we should we go next? Or better yet, how should we get there?\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com \n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw \nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig \n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nExecutive Producers: Safiya Nygaard & Tyler Williams\nHead of Production: Carey Fiock\nProduction Manager / Producer: Melissa Douglas\nJunior Associate Producer: Ishara Mathews\nProduction Assistant: Aayanah McCreary\nContent Promotions & Video Packaging Manager: Alaina Simmons\nShort Form Producer: Myia Lambe\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Mandy Padgett\nAssistant Editor: Hailey Cox\nGraphic Designer: Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n1:50 All Aboard The California Zephyr!\n3:41 Our Room Tour\n5:27 A Tour Of The Entire Train!\n8:06 Day 1: Sacramento & Lunch\n10:56 Nevada & Dinner\n12:56 Setting Up Our Room for Sleeping\n14:39 Day 2: Mooning (?!) & Colorado\n17:07 Conquering The Shower \n18:53 The Good, The Bad, & The…Cows?\n21:11 The Moffat Tunnel (& The History of the Zephyr)\n23:15 Denver & Drinks\n25:28 Day 3: Omaha & Breakfast\n27:09 Our Final Destination: Chicago! \n29:28 Outro\n\n#train #travel #vlog",

                "description": "HELLO FRIENDS!! This week we’re taking a 52-hour Amtrak sleeper train across the country! So, I've fallen over to the \"overnight sleeper train\" side of youtube - and I am HOOKED, people. And after watching hours and hours of train content, I decided - it was time to try my own hand at it. So we took the California Zephyr train, which travels from San Francisco to Chicago (and also the other direction as well) - across 7 states and over 2,400 miles!! We experienced everything from delays to endless sauce packets to MANY rock sightings. Would you try traveling across the US by train? And where do you think we should we go next?

            "description": "Olivia Rodrigo - pretty isn’t pretty | Vevo Official Live Performance \n\nOnly superlatives come to mind when trying to sum up Olivia Rodrigo’s last few years. Her impactful debut ballad ‘drivers license’ goes hand in hand with words such as “most” and “best”: most streams on Spotify in a single day and week, Top 100 most-streamed songs on the platform, the Best Pop Solo Performance award at that year’s GRAMMYs. That the teen sensation could follow the “drivers license” craze with “good 4 u,” “deja vu,” and ultimately her debut album ‘SOUR’ - all now equally beloved - was the first sign that the pop world had a rarified capital S Superstar on its hands. You can forget about that dreaded sophomore slump, too. Thanks in part to her trusty producer sidekick Dan Nigro, ‘GUTS’ elevates all the ingredients that really popped in ’SOUR,’ the 90s slacker rock guitar arrangements and riffs, the theater-kid earnestness, the talkative asides. There’s one key thematic difference. “Lots of the new songs are about growing up rather than breakups,” Olivia proudly stated recently. When we linked up with her at LA's Million Dollar Theater, not only had her wattage grown brighter, her command of the stage and camera were somehow even stronger than before. Speaking of growing up, \"pretty isn't pretty\" takes aim the not-so-nice social pressures one faces as the spotlight grows brighter, especially women. Another gut punch delivered on a platter of angsty pop-rock perfection. \n\nListen to GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS\nShop GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/store\n\nFollow Olivia Rodrigo:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oliviarodrigo\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oliviarodrigo\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OliviaRodrigoOfficial\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@livbedumb\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/livieshq\n\nVevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\nDirector: Skyler Brown\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nDirector, Line Production: Yanina Molina\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nLine Producer, Contrast Films: Cole Brian\nSenior Producer, Editorial: Ronni Leverich\nAssociate Producer: Lola Gatti\nAssociate Producer, Contrast Films: Sacha Noelle\nDirector of Photography: Tehillah De Castro\nProduction Designer: Helen Morales\nHead of Design: Sydney Emery\nDirector of Post Production: Michael Colman\nProject Manager: Dominic Siri\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nDirector, Talent: Gabby Prisciandaro\nHead of Artist/Label Relations & Digital Marketing: David McTiernan\n\nHayley Brownell – Drums\nCamila Mora - Keys\nMoa Munoz – Bass\nEmily Rosenfield – Guitar\nDaisy Spencer – Guitar\n \nAleen Keshishian - Lighthouse Management + Media\nZack Morgenroth - Lighthouse Management + Media\nJames Thompson - Lighthouse Management + Media\n \nStacy Jones – Musical Director\nMax Mitchell – Musical Director\nValerie Morehouse-wilde – Vocal Coach\nMelissa Garcia – Movement\n \nMarty Hom – Tour Director \nBret Chin-quan – Tour / Production Manager\nElisa Gonzalez – Production Coordinator\nBrian Pomp – Audio Engineer\nSeamus Fenton – Audio Engineer\nPaul Hager – Broadcast Mixer\nCraig Frank – Playback \nLuis Munoz – Backline Tech\nRyan Gore – Backline Tech\nMaurizio – Backline Tech\nChristian Pagliarulo - Runner\n \n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Cole Ewing\n1st AC: Michael Lemnitze\n2nd AC: Jenny Roh\nLoader: Chastin Noblett\n\nA1: Casey Graham\nA2: Maja Sazdic\n\nGaffer: Jihan \"Jay\" Casquejo\nBest Boy Electric: Peter Murphy\nSLT/Driver: Paul Kane\nSLT: Ben Bowen\nSLT: Mauricio Aguilar\nSLT: Diego Castellanos\nKey Grip: Kyle Sorvig\nBest Boy Grip: Connor Colby \nGrip: Hannah Rydberg\nGrip: Matt Seest\nGrip: Mason McLaury\nGrip: Nick Zajic\n\nGrip: Jacob Senn\nLCP: Ryan Jacob Morgan\n\nArt Director: Nicholas Kerr\nSet Decorator: Katie Balun\nLead Person: Ian Buckley \nArt Department Coordinator: Matthew Toth\nSet Dresser: Christopher \"Drew\" Wall\nSet Dresser: Jonathan \"Jrod\" Rodriguez\nSet Dresser: Jessen T.

                "description": "Olivia Rodrigo - pretty isn’t pretty | Vevo Official Live Performance \n\nOnly superlatives come to mind when trying to sum up Olivia Rodrigo’s last few years. Her impactful debut ballad ‘drivers license’ goes hand in hand with words such as “most” and “best”: most streams on Spotify in a single day and week, Top 100 most-streamed songs on the platform, the Best Pop Solo Performance award at that year’s GRAMMYs. That the teen sensation could follow the “drivers license” craze with “good 4 u,” “deja vu,” and ultimately her debut album ‘SOUR’ - all now equally beloved - was the first sign that the pop world had a rarified capital S Superstar on its hands. You can forget about that dreaded sophomore slump, too. Thanks in part to her trusty producer sidekick Dan Nigro, ‘GUTS’ elevates all the ingredients that really popped in ’SOUR,’ the 90s slacker rock guitar arrangements and riffs, the theater-kid earnestness, the talkative asides. There’s one key thematic difference. “Lots of the new songs are about growing up rather than breakups,” Olivia proudly stated recently. When we linked up with her at LA's Million Dollar Theater, not only had her wattage grown brighter, her command of the stage and camera were somehow even stronger than before. Speaking of growing up, \"pretty isn't pretty\" takes aim the not-so-nice social pressures one faces as the spotlight grows brighter, especially women. Another gut punch delivered on a platter of angsty pop-rock perfection. \n\nListen to GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/GUTS\nShop GUTS: https://OliviaRodrigo.lnk.to/store\n\nFollow Olivia Rodrigo:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oliviarodrigo\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oliviarodrigo\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OliviaRodrigoOfficial\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@livbedumb\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/livieshq\n\nVevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer, Contrast Films: Jordy Wax\nDirector: Skyler Brown\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nDirector, Line Production: Yanina Molina\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nLine Producer, Contrast Films: Cole Brian\nSenior Producer, Editorial: Ronni Leverich\nAssociate Producer: Lola Gatti\nAssociate Producer, Contrast Films: Sacha Noelle\nDirector of Photography: Tehillah De Castro\nProduction Designer: Helen Morales\nHead of Design: Sydney Emery\nDirector of Post Production: Michael Colman\nProject Manager: Dominic Siri\nEditor: Austin Prahl\nDirector, Talent: Gabby Prisciandaro\nHead of Artist/Label Relations & Digital Marketing: David McTiernan\n\nHayley Brownell – Drums\nCamila Mora - Keys\nMoa Munoz – Bass\nEmily Rosenfield – Guitar\nDaisy Spencer – Guitar\n \nAleen Keshishian - Lighthouse Management + Media\nZack Morgenroth - Lighthouse Management + Media\nJames Thompson - Lighthouse Management + Media\n \nStacy Jones – Musical Director\nMax Mitchell – Musical Director\nValerie Morehouse-wilde – Vocal Coach\nMelissa Garcia – Movement\n \nMarty Hom – Tour Director \nBret Chin-quan – Tour / Production Manager\nElisa Gonzalez – Production Coordinator\nBrian Pomp – Audio Engineer\nSeamus Fenton – Audio Engineer\nPaul Hager – Broadcast Mixer\nCraig Frank – Playback \nLuis Munoz – Backline Tech\nRyan Gore – Backline Tech\nMaurizio – Backline Tech\nChristian Pagliarulo - Runner\n \n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Cole Ewing\n1st AC: Michael Lemnitze\n2nd AC: Jenny Roh\nLoader: Chastin Noblett\n\nA1: Casey Graham\nA2: Maja Sazdic\n\nGaffer: Jihan \"Jay\" Casquejo\nBest Boy Electric: Peter Murphy\nSLT/Driver: Paul Kane\nSLT: Ben Bowen\nSLT: Mauricio Aguilar\nSLT: Diego Castellanos\nKey Grip: Kyle Sorvig\nBest Boy Grip: Connor Colby \nGrip: Hannah Rydberg\nGrip: Matt Seest\nGrip: Mason McLaury\nGrip: Nick Zajic\n\nGrip: Jacob Senn\nLCP: Ryan Jacob Morgan\n\nArt Director: Nicholas Kerr\nSet Decorator: Katie Balun\nLead Person: Ian Buckley \nArt Department Coordinator: Matthew Toth\nSet Dresser: Christopher \"Drew\" Wall\nSet Dresser: Jonathan \"Jrod\" Rodriguez\nSet Dresser: Jessen T.

As Travis awaits a full knee replacement in the coming days, he has decided to check one last item off his bucket list. Travis' goal is to back flip onto an elevated platform, do a nose bonk, then front flip out of the nose bonk back to his wheels. Banks plans to jump onto the platform, wheelie across, and backflip off. Both of these tricks have never been attempted, so come along for the ride as Nate Wessel and Hubert Rowland help Travis and Banks work through multiple ramp variations, distance measurements, platform angles, and injuries in an attempt to reach their goals.\n\nFollow Us:\nChannel 199 IG: https://www.instagram.com/channel199_/\nTravis IG: https://www.instagram.com/travispastrana/\nBRCC IG: https://www.instagram.com/blackriflecoffee/\nBRCC Motorsports IG: https://www.instagram.com/brcc_motorsports/\n\nShop Travis/BRCC: https://www.blackriflecoffee.com/pages/travis-pastrana",
