This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nNitish Bhaluni / Raj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nSachin Shroff / Shailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nNidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani / Khushi Mali as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder Suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak / Kiran Bhatt as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nNavina Wadekar / Monika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia",

The medical entrance exam is one of the toughest battles, and the pressure to succeed feels unrelenting. Whether it's the last-minute revision before an important mock test, the endless coaching classes, or the library hours spent perfecting mnemonics for tricky concepts, every day is a new challenge. Hostel struggles become part of life—learning to survive on late-night studies, chai breaks, and study groups that sometimes turn into therapy sessions.\n\nFor many students, the fear of failure looms large, especially with family expectations riding on their shoulders. Some come from small towns where becoming a future doctor is not just a personal goal but a family dream. The burden of competitive exams pushes students to their limits, testing their self-discipline and goal-oriented mindset. With every exam stress episode, the thought lingers—will she make it? Is this the make-or-break moment?\n\nIn Kota, friendships are forged in the midst of sleepless nights, where friendship goals mean helping each other with topper mindset strategies and notes that can make or break a rank. Some students rely on their teacher’s pet status to get extra guidance, while others push themselves with a never give up attitude. The road to success is full of sacrifices—missing family events, skipping social outings, and putting every ounce of energy into the hustle for the dream.\n\nBut this journey isn't just about studies. It's also about self-discovery, about realizing that hard work pays off only when paired with determination. Some students, like Bhagyashree, come to Kota with one shot at the dream, hoping that against all odds, their efforts will land them a seat in their dream MBBS journey. Others, like Saroj, have to balance dreams vs. reality, questioning whether their life-changing decision to come to Kota will ultimately lead them to success or if they’ll be forced to take a different path.\n\nFrom competitive exams to emotional breakdowns, from study struggles to moments of inspiration from mentors, every student here is fighting their own battle. Some thrive under the toughest pressure, while others seek motivation from their future doctor vision. But one thing remains true—this medical entrance exam isn’t just about cracking a test; it’s about proving to yourself that you have what it takes to push through the hardest days and emerge stronger. Will they find their turning point, or will the weight of expectations take them somewhere they never expected?\n\nThis is the world of Medical Dreams—where passion meets perseverance, where success is fought for every single day, and where a single exam has the power to change lives forever. 🚀"

            "description": "Shreya Ghoshal embarks on a new musical journey with devotion at its heart, beginning with a Saraswati Vandana—a sacred ode to the goddess of wisdom, music, and the arts. This newly composed hymn beautifully captures the essence of Ma Saraswati’s grace, symbolising the purity of mind, intellectual and spiritual enlightenment and creativity. Enriched by the ethereal voice of Shreya Ghoshal, whose pristine vocal texture brings unmatched beauty, the melody flows like a sacred offering, uplifting the soul and invoking the goddess’s blessings. Her vocals seamlessly weave into the poignant notes of Sarod and the lush choral arrangements. This musical offering is an invitation to immerse in the profound peace and inspiration that Ma Saraswati personifies.\n\nAudio Credits: \nSinger - Shreya Ghoshal \nComposer – Shreya Ghoshal, Kinjal Chatterjee\n\nGuitars – Abhishek Dasgupta\nProgramming - Abhishek Mestry \nAdditional Programming- Harsh Davda\nSarod – Pratik Srivastava\nFemale Chorus - Sharmistha Bhatkar & Madhura Paranjape\nMusic Arranger - Kinjal Chatterjee\n\nLive Instruments and vocals recorded by – \nHarshad Sathe, Samir Dharap, Adhithya Shivakumar, at The Sanctuary Audio Visual Studio\nAssisted by – Vedant Uttarkar\n\nMixed & Mastered by- Chinmay Harshe\n\n\nVideo Credits: \nVideo By: BToS Productions Pvt.

This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nNitish Bhaluni / Raj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nSachin Shroff / Shailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nNidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani / Khushi Mali as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder Suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak / Kiran Bhatt as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nNavina Wadekar / Monika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia",

            "description": "बसंत पंचमी के दिन ही मां सरस्वती का जन्म हुआ था। प्रचलित एक पौराणिक कथा के अनुसार, बसंत पंचमी के दिन भगवान ब्रह्मा ने माँ सरस्वती की रचना की थी। बसंत पंचमी के दिन भगवान शिव और माता पार्वती का विवाह पूर्व तिलकोत्सव हुआ था। इसलिए ये दिन विवाह या अन्य शुभ कार्यों के लिए उत्तम माना गया है। ब्रह्मा जी ने एक ऐसी देवी की रचना की थी जिनके चार हाथ थे। एक हाथ में वीणा, दुसरे हाथ में पुस्तक, तीसरे हाथ में माला और चौथा हाथ वर मुद्रा में था। जब ब्रह्मजी के कहने पर माँ सरस्वती ने वीणा बजाई तो संसार की सभी वस्तुओं में स्वर आ गया यही कारण है कि उन्होंने सरस्वती माँ को वीणा की देवी का नाम दिया।   \n🌹🙏https://youtu.be/DORcAwc2pIY🙏🌹\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/tseriesbhakti\nSaraswati Bhajan: Jai Jai Saraswati Mata \nSinger: Anuradha Paudwal \nMusic Director: Arun Paudwal \nLyrics: Traditional \nAlbum: Aarti Vol. 2 \nMusic Label: T-Series\n\nIf You like the video don't forget to share with others & also share your views.\nStay connected with us!!!\n► Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/tseriesbhakti\n► Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BhaktiSagarTseries/\n► Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tseriesbhakti",
