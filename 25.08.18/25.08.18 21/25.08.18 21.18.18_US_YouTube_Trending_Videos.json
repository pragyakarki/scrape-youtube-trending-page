This is practice for my videos, not for world records! I am also simulating ender eye calculation using a mod, I am only throwing the eyes to simulate a time spend, as official speedrunners use a bot to calculate the stronghold location off of 1/2 ender eyes.\n\nI am also using no fog, optifine zoom, increased pearl rates (matching 1.16 rates), and a custom f3 menu with Nether Coordinates.

            "description": "Check out the creepy trailer for GOOD BOY, an upcoming horror thriller movie starring Indy the Dog, Shane Jensen, Arielle Friedman, and Larry Fessenden.\n\nOur canine hero, Indy, finds himself on a new adventure with his human owner—and best friend—Todd, leaving city life for a long-vacant family home in the country. From the start, two things are abundantly clear: Indy is wary of the creepy old house, and his affection for Todd is unwavering. After moving in, Indy is immediately vexed by empty corners, tracks an invisible presence only he can see, perceives phantasmagoric warnings from a long-dead dog, and is haunted by visions of the previous occupant’s grim death. When Todd begins succumbing to the dark forces swirling around the house, Indy must battle a malevolence intent on dragging his beloved Todd into the afterlife.\n\nGood Boy is produced by Ben Leonberg and Kari Fischer. It is written by Alex Cannon and Ben Leonberg.\n\nGood Boy, directed by Ben Leonberg, opens in North American theaters on October 3, 2025 and opens in the UK on October 10, 2025.\n\n#GoodBoy #Movies #IGN",

Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

PC, PlayStation, and Xbox — https://wtplay.link/notexttospeech 💥 WT Mobile — https://wtm.game/notexttospeechh\n\nDiscord is testing some controversial new beta features, and some of them are going to make using Discord worse...\n\nBecause you can make your name impossible to read by using Display Name Styles, a feature that allows you to change the font, color, and effect of your Discord username (available only with Discord nitro of course). But you can also spend your hard earned money on more server boosts to unlock more clan tag icons to \"flex\" on people....\n\nThere's also a bunch of new GAMING features for Discord, like profile widgets, game pings, game store links, and game activity (which I will be turning off right away lol).\n\nHowever, between the mountains of cosmetic cash-grab features and gaming clutter, there's a beautiful valley of amazing Discord features. XDM search, report to mods, and a new anti-scam feature that will hopefully stop people from falling for scams on Discord.\n\nNote: These are experimental Discord features, things can and will change before the feature gets released. And in some cases, the feature may not even come out at all.\n\n\n\nLINKS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscord Previews\nhttps://discord.com/invite/discord-603970300668805120\n\n\nSOCIALS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscord Server\nhttps://discord.gg/ntts\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/notexttospeech\n\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n00:00 - Controversial Discord Beta Features\n00:33 - Display Name Styles\n04:24 - Custom Nitro Themes\n05:53 - Server Tag Packs...\n07:22 - Invite Links will be broken\n08:10 - [LEGENDARY] XDM Search\n09:29 - DISCORD GAMER WIDGETS\n10:24 - Discord is Steam (Game Activity)\n10:41 - Game Pings???\n11:56 - GAME STORE LINKS\n13:00 - A good Mod feature?\n14:53 - No More Scamming (hopefully)",

PC, PlayStation, and Xbox — https://wtplay.link/notexttospeech 💥 WT Mobile — https://wtm.game/notexttospeechh\n\nDiscord is testing some controversial new beta features, and some of them are going to make using Discord worse...\n\nBecause you can make your name impossible to read by using Display Name Styles, a feature that allows you to change the font, color, and effect of your Discord username (available only with Discord nitro of course). But you can also spend your hard earned money on more server boosts to unlock more clan tag icons to \"flex\" on people....\n\nThere's also a bunch of new GAMING features for Discord, like profile widgets, game pings, game store links, and game activity (which I will be turning off right away lol).\n\nHowever, between the mountains of cosmetic cash-grab features and gaming clutter, there's a beautiful valley of amazing Discord features. XDM search, report to mods, and a new anti-scam feature that will hopefully stop people from falling for scams on Discord.\n\nNote: These are experimental Discord features, things can and will change before the feature gets released. And in some cases, the feature may not even come out at all.\n\n\n\nLINKS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscord Previews\nhttps://discord.com/invite/discord-603970300668805120\n\n\nSOCIALS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscord Server\nhttps://discord.gg/ntts\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/notexttospeech\n\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n00:00 - Controversial Discord Beta Features\n00:33 - Display Name Styles\n04:24 - Custom Nitro Themes\n05:53 - Server Tag Packs...\n07:22 - Invite Links will be broken\n08:10 - [LEGENDARY] XDM Search\n09:29 - DISCORD GAMER WIDGETS\n10:24 - Discord is Steam (Game Activity)\n10:41 - Game Pings???\n11:56 - GAME STORE LINKS\n13:00 - A good Mod feature?\n14:53 - No More Scamming (hopefully)"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n#roblox #recommended #roblox99nightsintheforest #99nightsintheforest #robloxtrend",
