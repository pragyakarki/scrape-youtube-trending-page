After an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River.  Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia's life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened.  With trouble brewing in both realms, it's only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice's name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.\n\nBurton, a genre unto himself, directs from a screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar (Wednesday), story by Gough & Millar and Seth Grahame-Smith (The LEGO® Batman Movie), based on characters created by Michael McDowell & Larry Wilson.

It thus uttered:\nTakamagahara endless like Izumo, for it was a paradise perfect in its place.\nYet the sky turned dark and the great sun pulled the tides, and the Kami left numerous trails as if migrating.\nThe Yaoyorozu no Magakami manifested and slaughtered without mercy, yet little did they expect their peerless authority to be stolen and taken.\nIzumo broke seventy-thousand-and-thirty-three warrior's blades, forging the majestic Sentinels twelve in number.\nThe first was \"Truth,\" forged with the slain Sovereign of Revelation. It allowed mortals to comprehend all laws and order, to dissect all things and to recreate miracles.\nThe second was \"Sky,\" forged with the slain Eternal Zenith. It could turn the sky into walls and fortresses and pose obstacles for the Magatsu no Morokami's steps.\nThe third was \"Howl,\" forged with the slain Almighty Thunder. It could summon lightning to tear the sky, and the soaring meteors and thunder dealt divine justice.\nThe fourth was \"Mist,\" forged with the slain Everbreath. It could make winds break and shear the land, for gales to rage forever unceasing.\nThe fifth was \"Frost,\" forged with the slain Heaven's Winter Cloak. It could freeze and still the very order of time, to create boundless frozen wastes and stretch one moment into eternity.\nThe sixth was \"Fate,\" forged with the slain Spurned Sister of Mortality. It could make flowers bloom and cover barren graves, for life and death to dance in a cycle and dissipate.\nThe seventh was \"Flare,\" forged with the slain Flamebringer. It could summon fires to burn down the very world, to torch the skies and to char the earth.\nThe eighth was \"Thought,\" forged with the slain Wisdom Supreme. It could discern the past and future with the mirror of water, to tell truth from lies over years beyond reckoning.\nThe ninth was \"Root,\" forged with the slain Father of Lands. It could command islands to float into the heavens, for mountains and valleys to burst before armies.\nThe tenth was \"Form,\" forged with the slain Nether Lord. It could make the masses join in unity, for endless forms to ebb and flow as one.\nThe eleventh was \"Bind,\" forged with the slain Omen Ward. It drove misfortune into a binding cage, for evil and demons to instantly vanish.\nThe twelfth was \"Maw,\" forged with the slain Woes Eighty. It could corrode and age the very mortal world and make equal Kami and Oni, leaving an entity's four souls to be sundered in twain.\nThen the underworld was cleared out, the wars called to a halt, and the twelve blades broken and locked.\nIn the emptiness the dead souls grew restless, and under the black sun two blades were forged as Bearers of the world's destiny.\nOne was named \"Origin\" and the other named \"End,\" for all begun with humanity and shall end with Oni-kind.\nThe sounds of lamentation ceased, and the dead flowers rose and fell. The losers returned to the void, and the winners... became null.\nThe hobbling monk sang the song without a tune, for those who hold the power of Kami are walking backwards, towards divinity.\nWitnessed by the great sun, the land once named Izumo became completely devoid... of humans, Oni, and Kami.\n\nEnglish Voice:\nShiraga Oni — Sean Lynch\nThe Maiden Later Known as \"Acheron\" — Allegra Clark\n\nChinese Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/APAG_mclC4A\nJapanese Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/XbWbOIxbFMA\nKorean Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/d5p7FPzPSR0\n\nDownload Now\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nFollow us to get the latest info.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaistarrail\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron",

It could freeze and still the very order of time, to create boundless frozen wastes and stretch one moment into eternity.\nThe sixth was \"Fate,\" forged with the slain Spurned Sister of Mortality. It could make flowers bloom and cover barren graves, for life and death to dance in a cycle and dissipate.\nThe seventh was \"Flare,\" forged with the slain Flamebringer. It could summon fires to burn down the very world, to torch the skies and to char the earth.\nThe eighth was \"Thought,\" forged with the slain Wisdom Supreme. It could discern the past and future with the mirror of water, to tell truth from lies over years beyond reckoning.\nThe ninth was \"Root,\" forged with the slain Father of Lands. It could command islands to float into the heavens, for mountains and valleys to burst before armies.\nThe tenth was \"Form,\" forged with the slain Nether Lord. It could make the masses join in unity, for endless forms to ebb and flow as one.\nThe eleventh was \"Bind,\" forged with the slain Omen Ward. It drove misfortune into a binding cage, for evil and demons to instantly vanish.\nThe twelfth was \"Maw,\" forged with the slain Woes Eighty. It could corrode and age the very mortal world and make equal Kami and Oni, leaving an entity's four souls to be sundered in twain.\nThen the underworld was cleared out, the wars called to a halt, and the twelve blades broken and locked.\nIn the emptiness the dead souls grew restless, and under the black sun two blades were forged as Bearers of the world's destiny.\nOne was named \"Origin\" and the other named \"End,\" for all begun with humanity and shall end with Oni-kind.\nThe sounds of lamentation ceased, and the dead flowers rose and fell. The losers returned to the void, and the winners... became null.\nThe hobbling monk sang the song without a tune, for those who hold the power of Kami are walking backwards, towards divinity.\nWitnessed by the great sun, the land once named Izumo became completely devoid... of humans, Oni, and Kami.\n\nEnglish Voice:\nShiraga Oni — Sean Lynch\nThe Maiden Later Known as \"Acheron\" — Allegra Clark\n\nChinese Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/APAG_mclC4A\nJapanese Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/XbWbOIxbFMA\nKorean Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/d5p7FPzPSR0\n\nDownload Now\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nFollow us to get the latest info.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaistarrail\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

Es steht geschrieben wie folgt:\nTakamagahara, fern wie Izumo, Land der gar höchsten Glückseligkeit.\nFinster sind dort Himmel und Erde, große Sonne lenkt die Gezeiten, so rauscht Götterwanderung hinab auf dem Fluss der Zeit.\nYaoyorozu-no-Magakami schlachteten ab ganz ohne Gnade, ahnten nicht, dass gestohlen würde ihre Unsterblichkeit.\nSiebzigtausenddreiunddreißig Schwerter Izumos brachen entzwei, geschmiedet der Ediktschwerter zwölf, zum Schutze der Menschheit.\nEins ist „Wahrheit“, gegossen mit dem „Gott der Offenbarung“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche alle Gesetzesprinzipien erkennen, alles dekonstruieren zur Erschaffung von Wundern.\nZwei ist „Himmel“, gegossen mit dem „Ehrwürdigen des Himmels“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche den Himmel zur Wand machen und Magatsu-no-Morokami den Durchgang erschweren.\nDrei ist „Vogelsang“, gegossen mit dem „Donnergott“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche ein Loch in den Himmel reißen, durch die Macht des Donners himmlische Strafen verhängen.\nVier ist „Bergnebel“, gegossen mit dem „Gott des Windes“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche erderschütternde Winde herbeirufen, Wolken und Regen in gewaltigen Orkanen tosen lassen.\nFünf ist „Frost“, gegossen mit dem „Himmlischen Wintergewand“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche Zeit einfrieren, schier endlose eisige Flächen erschaffen.\nSechs ist „Leben“, gegossen mit dem „Ewigen Gestein“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche tote Hügel zum Blühen bringen, den Fluss von Leben und Tod spurlos verschwinden lassen.\nSieben ist „Brand“, gegossen mit dem „Schicksal des Feuers“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche alles in Schutt und Asche legen, selbst den Himmel in Brand setzen.\nAcht ist „Gefühl“, gegossen mit dem „Weisheitsgott“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche im Wasserspiegel die Zukunft erkennen, Tausende von Generationen nicht Falsches und Wahres sehen.\nNeun ist „Fundament“, gegossen mit dem „Großen Bergherrn“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche Inseln hoch im Himmel hängen, Berg wie Tal vor den Truppen wegbröckeln lassen.\nZehn ist „Tausend“, gegossen mit dem „Gott der Unterwelt“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche alle Menschen der Welt zu einer Einheit verbinden, die Gezeiten nach Belieben steigen und fallen lassen.\nElf ist „Bund“, gegossen mit dem „Schutzgott“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche alle Pfade in Käfige fehlleiten, böse Geister und alles Übel verschwinden lassen.\nZwölf ist „Mahl“, gegossen mit dem „Gott des Unglücks“. Mit ihm können Sterbliche die langlebige Welt zerfallen lassen, die Grenzen zwischen Göttern und Geistern verwischen.\nWelten hinweggefegt, Kämpfe entbrannt, zwölf Strahlen gebrochen entzwei;\nDie Wüste leer, schwarze Sonne so klar, Last der Welt auf zwei Schwertern voll Ehre.\nDer Anfang weilt im ersten, dem zweiten gehört das Ende; eins ist der Mensch und der Geist ist zwei.\nEin Bruch und die Stimmen schweigen still, Pracht der Blumen verfallen und welk. Der Verlierer kehrt zurück ins Nichts, der Gewinner wird zur Leere.\nHumpelnde Mönche sangen unmelodische Lieder und diejenigen mit göttlichen Kräften zogen sich zu den Göttern zurück.\nUnter dem Blick der großen Sonne, auf dem Land, das einst als Izumo bekannt war, sind Menschen, Götter und Geister ... nirgendwo mehr zu finden.\n\nEnglische Stimme:\nShiraga Oni – Sean Lynch\nDie Jungfrau, die später als „Acheron“ bekannt wurde – Allegra Clark\n\nJetzt herunterladen\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nFolge unseren offiziellen sozialen Medien, um die neuesten Informationen zu erhalten.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.DE/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

                "description": "Les planètes jumelles étaient enlacées dans leur destin tragique, et un chant défunt se répandait à travers la grotte où la lumière se cachait.\nCe chant n'avait ni début ni fin, ni sonorité ni résonnance. Il ne provenait de la voix d'aucun être, et n'était entendu par personne. Ses paroles étaient les suivantes :\nTakamagahara, vaste étendue éternelle, miroir d'Izumo en sa splendeur, était un paradis divin de pureté.\nLe ciel et la terre plongèrent dans l'obscurité, le grand soleil fit monter les marées, tandis que les kami laissaient des traces dans leur avancée.\nLes innombrables Magatsu-hinokami firent apparition et se vouèrent à un massacre sans pitié. Pourtant, ils ne s'attendaient pas à ce que leur autorité alors incontestée puisse leur être soutirée.\nIzumo brisa soixante-dix mille et trente-trois lames de guerrier pour forger les Douze lames protectrices de l'Édit.\nLa première était Vérité, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu du Souverain de la Révélation. Elle permit aux mortels d'acquérir la compréhension de la loi et de l'ordre, de décomposer l'univers pour recréer des miracles.\nLa seconde était Céleste, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu du Zénith éternel. Elle pouvait façonner le ciel pour en faire des remparts et des forteresses qui faisaient obstacles à l'avancée des Magatsu-hinokami.\nLa troisième était Fracas, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu du Tonnerre tout-puissant. Elle pouvait invoquer la foudre qui fendait le ciel, faisant s'abattre les météores et le tonnerre pour infliger le châtiment divin.\nLa quatrième était Brume, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu du Long vent. Elle pouvait provoquer des bourrasques capables de fendre et de ciseler la terre, pour que les tempêtes se déchaînent sans fin.\nLa cinquième était Givre, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu du Manteau céleste d'hiver. Elle pouvait geler le temps lui-même pour créer d'immenses étendues glaciales et étendre un instant jusqu'à l'éternité.\nLa sixième était Destinée, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu de la Sœur de la mortalité. Elle pouvait faire s'épanouir les fleurs et recouvrir les tombes désolées, permettant à la vie et à la mort de danser en un cycle éternel.\nLa septième était Ardente, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu des Flammes du malheur. Elle pouvait invoquer le feu pour brûler le monde, embraser les cieux et incendier la terre.\nLa huitième était Conscience, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu de la Sagesse omnisciente. Elle pouvait consulter le passé et prévoir l'avenir à l'aide du miroir d'eau, transcendant le vrai et le faux à travers les millénaires.\nLa neuvième était Racine, et avait été forgée avec le corps pourfendu du Père des contrées. Elle avait le pouvoir de suspendre des archipels dans le ciel, et de provoquer des fissures et crevasses sur la terre, déchirant tout ce qui se trouvait sur son passage.\nLa dixième était Myriade, et avait été forgée avec le corps pourfendu avec le Souverain du royaume des morts. Elle pouvait rassembler les masses et les unir, leurs innombrables silhouettes fluctuant telles les marées.\nLa onzième était Lien, forgée à partir du corps pourfendu du Gardien des présages. Elle avait le pouvoir de confiner le malheur dans une cage scellée, faisant disparaître instantanément le mal et les démons.\nLa douzième était Vorace, et avait été forgée à partir du corps pourfendu des Misères infinies. Elle avait le pouvoir de corroder et de vieillir le monde mortel, mais aussi de confondre kami et oni, rendant indistincts dieux et démons, scindant les âmes en deux.\nPuis, le monde souterrain fut purifié, les conflits suspendus, et les douze lames brisées avant d'être scellées.\nLes âmes défuntes s'agitaient au milieu du néant. Sous le soleil noir, deux lames furent forgées pour devenir les porteuses du destin du monde.\nL'une était nommée Commencement, et l'autre Fin. Car tout commença avec les humains, et tout se terminera avec les oni.\nLes lamentations s'apaisèrent, et les fleurs fanées se dressèrent avant de retomber. Les vaincus disparurent dans le vide, tandis que les victorieux... devinrent néant.\nLe moine boiteux psalmodiait ce chant de manière monotone, car ceux qui possèdent la puissance des kami marchent à reculons vers la divinité.\nSous le regard du grand soleil, la terre jadis nommée Izumo devint entièrement vide... d'humains, d'oni et de dieux.\n\nVoix anglaises :\nOni aux cheveux blancs : Sean Lynch\nLa jeune fille, connue plus tard sous le nom d'« Achéron » : Allegra Clark\n\nTélécharger maintenant\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Achéron"

                "description": "Kedua planet ini saling terjalin dengan nasib tragis satu sama lain, dan sebuah lagu yang telah lama hilang tersebar di antara lembah tempat matahari bersembunyi.\nLagu tersebut tidak memiliki awal dan akhir, tidak memiliki suara dan gaung, tidak berasal dari penyanyi, dan tidak ada penyanyinya, tidak terdengar oleh siapa pun. Tulisannya:\nTakamagahara tidak ada habisnya seperti Izumo, karena tempatnya adalah tanah suci yang sempurna.\nTapi langit menjadi gelap dan matahari besar menarik arus, para \"Kami\" meninggalkan banyak jejak seolah-olah bermigrasi.\nYaoyorozu no Magakami muncul di dunia dan membasmi manusia tanpa ampun. Siapa yang menyangka kekuatan tertinggi mereka akan dicuri.\nIzumo menghancurkan tujuh puluh ribu tiga puluh tiga pedang prajurit, menempa Sentinel agung yang berjumlah dua belas.\nYang pertama adalah \"Truth\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Sovereign of Revelation\". Pedang ini memungkinkan manusia fana untuk memahami semua hukum dan ketertiban, membedah segala sesuatu dan menciptakan kembali keajaiban;\nYang kedua adalah \"Sky\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Eternal Zenith\". Pedang ini bisa mengubah langit menjadi tembok dan benteng, menjadi penghalang bagi langkah para Magatsu no Morokami;\nYang ketiga adalah \"Howl\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Almighty Thunder\". Pedang ini dapat memanggil petir untuk mengoyak langit, dan meteor yang melonjak serta guntur yang menghasilkan keadilan ilahi;\nYang keempat adalah \"Mist\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Everbreath\". Pedang ini dapat membelah angin dan menebas daratan, sehingga angin kencang mengamuk tanpa henti;\nYang kelima adalah \"Frost\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Heaven's Winter Cloak\". Pedang ini dapat membekukan dan mempertahankan waktu, untuk membuat bumi beku yang tidak terbatas dan merentangkan sebuah momen menuju keabadian;\nYang keenam adalah \"Fate\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Spurned Sister of Mortality\". Pedang ini dapat membuat bunga bermekaran menutupi kuburan yang tandus, agar hidup dan mati menari dalam satu siklus lalu menghilang;\nYang ketujuh adalah \"Flare\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Flamebringer\". Pedang ini dapat memanggil api untuk membakar dunia, membakar langit dan menghanguskan bumi;\nYang kedelapan adalah \"Thought\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Wisdom Supreme\". Pedang ini dapat membedakan masa lalu dan masa depan dengan cermin air, untuk mengatakan kebenaran dari kebohongan tanpa melihat yang salah dan benar selama bertahun-tahun;\nYang kesembilan adalah \"Root\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Father of Lands\". Pedang ini dapat memerintahkan pulau-pulau melayang ke langit, agar gunung dan lembah meledak di hadapan prajurit-prajurit;\nYang kesepuluh adalah \"Form\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Nether Lord\". Pedang ini dapat membuat massa bergabung dalam kesatuan, bentuk-bentuk tidak berujung yang pasang surut akan bersatu menjadi satu;\nYang kesebelas adalah \"Bind\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Omen Ward\". Pedang ini dapat mengusir kemalangan ke dalam kurungan yang mengikat, agar kejahatan dan Oni segera lenyap;\nYang kedua belas adalah \"Maw\", yang ditempa dari tubuh \"Woes Eighty\". Pedang ini dapat menyebabkan erosi dan pembusukan dalam kehidupan abadi, sehingga tidak bisa dibedakan antara \"Kami\" dan Oni.\nKemudian dunia bawah dibersihkan, peperangan dihentikan, dan kedua belas bilah pedang dihancurkan dan disegel.\nDalam kehampaan jiwa-jiwa yang tewas menjadi gelisah, dan di bawah matahari hitam, dua bilah pedang ditempa sebagai pembawa takdir dunia.\nYang satu diberi nama \"Origin\" dan yang lainnya diberi nama \"End\", karena semua dimulai dengan kemanusiaan dan diakhiri dengan Oni.\nSuara ratapan berhenti, dan bunga-bunga bermekaran dan berguguran. Yang kalah kembali ke ketiadaan, dan yang menang ... menjadi kekosongan.\nBiksu yang terpincang-pincang menyanyikan lagu tanpa nada, mereka yang memegang kekuatan \"Kami\" berjalan mundur menuju keilahian.\nDisaksikan oleh matahari besar, tanah yang dulu bernama Izumo menjadi sama sekali tidak ada ... manusia, Oni, dan \"Kami\".\n\nCV Bahasa Inggris:\n\"Shiraga Oni\" — Sean Lynch\nGadis yang Kemudian Dikenal sebagai \"Acheron\" — Allegra Clark\n\nUnduh Sekarang\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nIkuti akun medsos kami untuk mendapatkan info terbaru\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.ID/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

                "description": "Os planetas duplos estavam entrelaçados no trágico destino um do outro, e uma canção finada se espalhava pela Caverna Onde a Luz se Esconde.\nA música não tinha início, nem fim, não tinha som, nem eco, não havia cantor e não era ouvida por ninguém. Assim proferiu:\nTakamagahara, infinita como Izumo, formava um paraíso perfeito em seu estado.\nNisso, o céu escurecia e o grande sol puxava as marés. Já os kami deixavam inúmeras trilhas como se estivessem migrando.\nYaoyorozu no Magakami se faziam presentes e massacravam sem nenhuma piedade, mas não esperavam que sua autoridade incomparável fosse roubada e tomada.\nIzumo quebrou setenta mil e trinta e três lâminas de guerreiros, forjando majestosas doze Sentinelas.\nA primeira foi a \"Verdade\", forjada ao matar o Soberano do Apocalipse. Ela permitiu que os mortais compreendessem leis e a ordem para discernir todas as coisas e recriar milagres.\nA segunda foi o \"Céu\", forjada com a morte de Zênite Eterno. Ela poderia transformar o céu em muralhas e fortalezas e criar obstáculos aos passos de Magatsu-hinokami.\nA terceira foi o \"Uivo\", forjada com a morte do Todo-Poderoso Trovão. Ela era capaz de invocar relâmpagos para cortar o céu, meteoros e raios para acabar com a justiça divina.\nA quarta foi a \"Névoa\", forjada ao matar o Vento Distante. Ela poderia criar rajadas de vento para cortar a terra, fazendo com que os vendavais rugissem incessantemente.\nA quinta foi o \"Gelo\", forjada ao matar o Manto Invernal Celestial. Era capaz de congelar e parar o próprio tempo, criando fragmentos congelados e ilimitados, estendendo um momento pela eternidade.\nA sexta foi o \"Destino\", forjada ao matar a Irmã Rejeitada da Mortalidade. Ela poderia desabrochar flores e cobrir túmulos inóspitos, fazendo com que a vida e a morte dançassem juntas durante um ciclo e, depois, se dissipassem.\nA sétima foi a \"Faísca\", forjada ao matar as Chamas do Infortúnio. Ela conseguia invocar fogo para queimar o mundo inteiro, incendiar os céus e carbonizar a terra.\nA oitava foi o \"Pensamento\", forjada ao matar a Sabedoria Inigualável. Ela poderia discernir o passado e o futuro como um espelho d'água, distinguindo a verdade da mentira ao longo de incalculáveis anos.\nA nona foi a \"Raiz\", forjada ao matar o Pai das Terras. Era capaz de comandar que as ilhas flutuassem pelos céus, e que montanhas e vales explodissem diante de exércitos.\nA décima foi a \"Forma\", forjada ao matar o Lorde Inferior. Ela poderia unir qualquer massa em uma só, para que formas infinitas refluíssem e fluíssem como uma só.\nA décima primeira foi o \"Vínculo\", forjada ao matar a Sentinela do Presságio, que levava infortúnio a uma jaula, para que o mal e os demônios desaparecessem instantaneamente.\nA décima segunda foi a \"Mandíbula\", forjada ao matar Inúmeros Males. Ela podia corroer e envelhecer o próprio mundo mortal e transformar kami e oni de igual para igual, fazendo com que as quatro almas de uma entidade fossem divididas em duas.\nAssim, o submundo foi destruído, as guerras foram interrompidas e as doze lâminas foram quebradas e seladas.\nNo vazio, as almas mortas ficaram inquietas e, sob o sol negro, duas lâminas foram forjadas como Portadoras do destino do mundo.\nUma foi chamada de \"Início\" e a outra de \"Fim\", para afirmar que tudo começa com a humanidade e termina com oni.\nOs sons de lamentações cessaram e as flores mortas desabrocharam até murcharem. Os perdedores voltaram ao vazio e os vencedores... voltaram ao nada.\nO monge manco cantou a canção sem melodia para que aqueles que detêm o poder dos kami regressassem em direção à divindade.\nTestemunhada pelo grande sol, a terra foi chamada de Izumo e tornou-se completamente vazia... de humanos, oni e kami.\n\nVoz em inglês:\nShiraga Oni: Sean Lynch\nA donzela mais tarde conhecida como \"Acheron\": Allegra Clark\n\nBaixar Agora\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nSiga-nos para receber as novidades.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.PT\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaisr_pt\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

                "description": "The dual planets were intertwined in each other's tragic destiny, and a dead song was scattered amongst the Cave Where Light Hid.\nThe song had no beginning and no end, had no sound and no echo, came from no singer, and was heard by none. It thus uttered:\nTakamagahara endless like Izumo, for it was a paradise perfect in its place.\nYet the sky turned dark and the great sun pulled the tides, and the Kami left numerous trails as if migrating.\nThe Yaoyorozu no Magakami manifested and slaughtered without mercy, yet little did they expect their peerless authority to be stolen and taken.\nIzumo broke seventy-thousand-and-thirty-three warrior's blades, forging the majestic Sentinels twelve in number.\nThe first was \"Truth,\" forged with the slain Sovereign of Revelation. It allowed mortals to comprehend all laws and order, to dissect all things and to recreate miracles.\nThe second was \"Sky,\" forged with the slain Eternal Zenith. It could turn the sky into walls and fortresses and pose obstacles for the Magatsu no Morokami's steps.\nThe third was \"Howl,\" forged with the slain Almighty Thunder. It could summon lightning to tear the sky, and the soaring meteors and thunder dealt divine justice.\nThe fourth was \"Mist,\" forged with the slain Everbreath. It could make winds break and shear the land, for gales to rage forever unceasing.\nThe fifth was \"Frost,\" forged with the slain Heaven's Winter Cloak. It could freeze and still the very order of time, to create boundless frozen wastes and stretch one moment into eternity.\nThe sixth was \"Fate,\" forged with the slain Spurned Sister of Mortality. It could make flowers bloom and cover barren graves, for life and death to dance in a cycle and dissipate.\nThe seventh was \"Flare,\" forged with the slain Flamebringer. It could summon fires to burn down the very world, to torch the skies and to char the earth.\nThe eighth was \"Thought,\" forged with the slain Wisdom Supreme. It could discern the past and future with the mirror of water, to tell truth from lies over years beyond reckoning.\nThe ninth was \"Root,\" forged with the slain Father of Lands. It could command islands to float into the heavens, for mountains and valleys to burst before armies.\nThe tenth was \"Form,\" forged with the slain Nether Lord. It could make the masses join in unity, for endless forms to ebb and flow as one.\nThe eleventh was \"Bind,\" forged with the slain Omen Ward. It drove misfortune into a binding cage, for evil and demons to instantly vanish.\nThe twelfth was \"Maw,\" forged with the slain Woes Eighty. It could corrode and age the very mortal world and make equal Kami and Oni, leaving an entity's four souls to be sundered in twain.\nThen the underworld was cleared out, the wars called to a halt, and the twelve blades broken and locked.\nIn the emptiness the dead souls grew restless, and under the black sun two blades were forged as Bearers of the world's destiny.\nOne was named \"Origin\" and the other named \"End,\" for all begun with humanity and shall end with Oni-kind.\nThe sounds of lamentation ceased, and the dead flowers rose and fell. The losers returned to the void, and the winners... became null.\nThe hobbling monk sang the song without a tune, for those who hold the power of Kami are walking backwards, towards divinity.\nWitnessed by the great sun, the land once named Izumo became completely devoid... of humans, Oni, and Kami.\n\nEnglish Voice:\nShiraga Oni — Sean Lynch\nThe Maiden Later Known as \"Acheron\" — Allegra Clark\n\nChinese Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/APAG_mclC4A\nJapanese Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/XbWbOIxbFMA\nKorean Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/d5p7FPzPSR0\n\nDownload Now\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nFollow us to get the latest info.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaistarrail\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

Así reza:\nTakamagahara, infinita como Izumo, era un paraíso perfecto.\nPero el cielo se oscureció, el gran sol desató las mareas, y los kami, en movimiento, dejaron sus huellas.\nLos numerosos kami de las desgracias aparecieron y asesinaron sin piedad, pero no esperaban que su autoridad fuera arrebatada.\nIzumo rompió 70 033 espadas de guerreros y forjó las doce Espadas Protectoras.\nLa primera era \"Verdad\", forjada con el Soberano de la Revelación. Con ella, los mortales comprendían todas las leyes y principios, diseccionaban todas las cosas y recreaban milagros.\nLa segunda era \"Cielo\", forjada con el Cénit Eterno. Podía convertir el cielo en una muralla, dificultando el paso de los kami de las desgracias.\nLa tercera era \"Aullido\", forjada con el Trueno Poderoso. Podía invocar rayos que desgarraban el cielo, y los meteoros y los truenos impartían justicia divina.\nLa cuarta era \"Niebla\", forjada con el Viento Ululante. Podía hacer que el viento arrasara la tierra y que las galernas azotaran sin cesar.\nLa quinta era \"Escarcha\", forjada con el Abrigo del Firmamento. Podía congelar y detener el tiempo para crear infinitos páramos helados y estirar un momento por toda la eternidad.\nLa sexta era \"Vida\", forjada con la Hermana Repudiada de la Mortalidad. Podía hacer que las tumbas florecieran, que la vida y la muerte se entrelazan y se disiparan.\nLa séptima era \"Fulgor\", forjada con las Llamas de la Desgracia. Podía invocar fuegos que incendiaran el mundo, quemaran el cielo y calcinaran la tierra.\nLa octava era \"Iluminación\", forjada con Sabiduría Incomparable. Podía discernir el pasado y el futuro con el espejo de agua y distinguir las verdades y mentiras de años distantes.\nLa novena era \"Fundamento\", forjada con el Padre de las Tierras. Podía ordenar a las islas que flotaran en el cielo, y que las montañas y valles se interpusieran ante los ejércitos.\nLa décima era \"Millares\", forjada con el Señor del Inframundo. Podía unir multitudes y que actuaran como un solo cuerpo.\nLa undécima era \"Atadura\", forjada con el Guardián del Presagio. Podía sellar la desgracia y hacer que los males y los demonios desaparecieran en un instante.\nLa duodécima era \"Devoradora\", forjada con Infinitas Desdichas. Podía corroer y envejecer el mundo mortal e igualar a los kami y los oni, dividiendo las cuatro almas de una entidad.\nEntonces, el inframundo quedó despejado, la guerra se detuvo y las doce espadas se rompieron y se guardaron.\nEn el vacío, las almas muertas se inquietaron, y bajo el sol negro se forjaron dos espadas portadoras del destino del mundo.\nUna se llamaba \"Principio\" y la otra \"Fin\", porque todo empezó con la humanidad y terminará con los oni.\nLos lamentos cesaron y las flores muertas brotaron y se marchitaron. Los perdedores regresaron al vacío y los ganadores... se convirtieron en nada.\nEl monje cojo cantaba sin afinar, porque quienes ostentan el poder de los kami andan de espaldas hacia la divinidad.\nBajo el gran sol, la tierra que antes se llamaba Izumo se quedó sin humanos, oni ni kami.\n\nVoces en inglés:\nShiraga Oni: Sean Lynch\nLa joven (más tarde conocida como \"Acheron): Allegra Clark\n\nDescargar ahora\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nSíguenos para enterarte de las últimas novedades.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/honkaistarrailES/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaisr_es\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

                "description": "Две планеты вплелись в трагичные судьбы друг друга, и песнь об их гибели разлилась по Пещере, Скрывающей Свет.\nПеснь без начала и конца, без звука и эха, без певца и слушателя. В ней пелось:\nТакамагахара - бескрайняя, словно сама Идзумо, мир блаженства на все времена.\nНо он вдруг почернел, и великое солнце приливом своим призвало бесчисленных ками.\nДемонов тьма убивает людей, но их ждал внезапный отпор.\nНа Идзумо разбили семьдесят тысяч клинков, а затем ещё тридцать три, и отлили двенадцать Хранителей, чтобы всех они ками смели.\nПервый был Правдой, из тела Жнеца. Людям он даровал силу постигать законы мироздания, так они творили чудеса и процветанье.\nВторой стал Небом, из тела Апогея. Превращал он эмпирей в стены и крепости, чиня препятствия демонам.\nТретьим был Вой, из плоти Громовержца. Разрывал он молнией небо, насылая небесную кару.\nЧетвёртого звали Туман, из плоти Несносного Вихря. Шквалы его громили землю, вызывая бесконечные бури.\nМорозом пятый был, из тела Зимней Мантии. Он время замораживал, так на обледенелой почве мгновенье превращалось в вечность.\nШестого прозвали Судьба, из тела Сестры Тленности. Он распускал бутоны на старых могилах, и смерти и жизни тени кружились, исчезая во мраке.\nСедьмым стал Жар, из тела Пламени Бездолья. Вызывая пожар, он мог бы поджечь целый мир, палить небеса и пеплом землю покрыть.\nВосьмой - это Мысль, из плоти Единой Мудрости. На глади воды он видел былое и пришлое, и правду от лжи он мог отличить во веки веков.\nДевятым стал Корень, из плоти Прародителя Пустошей. Он мог острова поднимать в небеса, и армия с ним рушила горы и долы.\nДесятым был Множество, из тела Великого Владыки. Он толпы в союзы сбирал, чтоб в едином приливе наступали тела и тени их.\nУздой одиннадцатого звали, из тела Стража Всех Знамений. Вокруг страды связал он путы, чтоб зло и демоны исчезли и не нагнали больше смуты.\nДвенадцатый - Утроба, из плоти Несметных Несчастий. Он гнилью покрывал и разъедал весь смертный мир, ками и óни стали одним, четыре души надвое он расколол.\nКогда был развеян мрак и горн триумфа вострубил, каждый из них отправился в лом и резню свою прекратил.\nИ мёртвые души плясали тогда в пустоте, и два новых клинка под чёрным солнцем были отлиты, чтоб вершить судьбы на этой земле.\nОдин стал Началом, другой - Концом. Начало людского рода - конец дьявольского сброда.\nЗатихли крики плача, увядшие цветы опали, проигравшие - в бездне, победителей... не стало.\nХромоногий монах бормочет, а не напевает, песнь тем, кто, получив силу богов, возвращается к божественности.\nЛишь великое солнце свидетель того, как на земле по имени Идзумо не стало людей, óни и ками.\n\nАнглийские CV:\nОни Сирага - Sean Lynch\nДевушка, позже известная как Ахерон, - Allegra Clark\n\nЗагрузить сейчас\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nСледите за нашими последними новостями\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nВКонтакте: https://vk.com/honkaistarrail_official\nTelegram: https://t.me/honkaistarrailofficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Ахерон"

            "description": "He’s only the stuntman, but he’s stealing the show.\n#TheFallGuyMovie Only in Theaters May 3. \n\n------\n\nHe’s a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right? \n\nFrom real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy. \n\nOscar® nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie—being directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)—goes missing.\n\nWhile the film’s ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film’s most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody’s good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.\n\nInspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). \n\nFrom a screenplay by Hobbs & Shaw screenwriter Drew Pearce, The Fall Guy is produced by Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, Nobody, Atomic Blonde) and David Leitch for their company 87North, and by Ryan Gosling and by Guymon Casady (Game of Thrones, Steve Jobs and executive producer of the upcoming series Ripley) for Entertainment 360. The film is executive produced by Drew Pearce, Entertainment 360’s Geoff Shaevitz and the creator of the original Fall Guy television series, Glen A. Larson.\n\nWebsite: http://www.TheFallGuyMovie.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thefallguymovie \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thefallguymovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Universalpics \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures\nX: https://twitter.com/thefallguymovie",

Megan sets the record straight on some of the craziest rumors she’s heard about herself - like being in the Illuminati, performing Satanic rituals, and what plastic surgeries she’s had done. She talks about her childhood, dysfunctional family dynamic, and how she never really fit in at school. Megan gets real about feeling different from everyone else and how that often left her feeling lonely. She opens up about her complicated relationship with her body, when she first started to criticize it, and why she’s never felt like a “sex symbol.” Megan discusses all the ways she’s been hyper-sexualized and brutally bullied by the media throughout her career and why she’s nearing her breaking point. Finally, she discusses the toxic romantic relationships she’s had in her past and even gives insight into her current relationship with MGK.

                "description": "Zwei Planeten, einander verwoben in ein tragisches Schicksal, tanzen einen ewigen Kreis um eine große, schwarze Sonne.\nZuerst wurden auf einem dieser Planeten Menschen geboren. Sie neigten ihre Köpfe und nannten das Land unter ihren Füßen „Izumo“; dann hoben sie ihre Köpfe und nannten die Welt im Himmel „Takamagahara“.\nEines Tages stiegen „Yaoyorozu-no-kami“ aus Takamagahara herab. Diese bösen Bestien, die sich Götter nannten, ließen den Himmel einstürzen, die Meere brennen und den Erdboden zusammenbrechen ... Die Menschen waren schockiert, als sie feststellten, dass dies nicht eine Invasion zum Herrschen, Dominieren oder Plündern war, sondern dass die bösen Kami nur zur Jagd gekommen waren.\nZu dieser Zeit von Leben und Tod schlug Izumo den Weg des „Kami-Massakers“ ein, nutzte die gesamte Macht des Landes, um den schrecklichen „Gott der Offenbarung“ zu töten, und schmiedete seinen tierischen Körper zu dem ursprünglichen „Ediktschwert“.\nDurch das Rezitieren des in die Klinge eingravierten Mantras konnte ein Schwertträger Takamagaharas göttliches Schicksal in den Händen halten, um die bösen Taten der Götter zu vergelten, sie zu bekämpfen und die Welt zu retten.\nDaraufhin begann das Reich Izumo einen langen Eroberungszug, bei dem im Gegenzug für den Sturz eines Gottes nach dem anderen unzählige Opfer gebracht wurden, tausende Schwerter zerbrachen und schließlich die zwölf „Ediktschwerter zum Schutze der Welt“ geschmiedet wurden.\nIn diesem grausamen Überlebenskampf nutzte das Reich Izumo die Macht der Ediktschwerter, um die barbarische, dunkle Welt zu erhellen und schillernde Stadtstaaten zu errichten.\nDas einst unerreichbare Reich der Götter war nun in greifbare Nähe gerückt ...\nDoch die Geschichte fand in diesem Moment ein jähes Ende, als sich die Existenz zweier Planeten in Luft auflöste und sie spurlos verschwanden.\nHeute ist die Vergangenheit des Grenzsterns Izumo nur noch in wenigen Aufzeichnungen im Universum zu finden. Gelehrte sind sich über seinen Untergang uneinig, und niemand konnte das Rätsel lösen.\nDie Geschichte von Izumo hätte ein langer, fließender Fluss sein sollen, aber er wurde mit einem Messer durchtrennt, sodass die gesamte Vergangenheit und Zukunft im Nichts verschwand.\nHat Izumo etwa nie existiert und ist nur eine erfundene Geschichte? Ist dies alles etwa Fantasie, eine Verwechslung von Ursache und Wirkung? Handelt es sich um ein weiteres schreckliches Experiment von „Dr. Primitiv“, oder ist es ein Vorbote für die Rückkehr der Gier vom Ende des Kosmos?\nDie Antwort kennt nur die große, dunkle Sonne. Doch sie schweigt für immer.\nDenn alles, was geschehen ist, muss zu einem Ende kommen, und alles, was zu einem Ende gekommen ist, muss wieder geschehen. Das Universum kehrt für alle Ewigkeit in seinen Schatten zurück, und Izumo ist letztendlich nur eine Ellipse in einer Fußnote.\n\nPräsentiert von: miHoYo Anime\nGemeinschaftsproduktion mit: Fantasier Animation, RED DOG CULTURE HOUSE\nMusik: HOYO-MiX\n\nEnglische Stimme:\nSchwarzer Schwan – Arryn Zech\nAcheron – Allegra Clark\n\nJetzt herunterladen\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nFolge unseren offiziellen sozialen Medien, um die neuesten Informationen zu erhalten.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.DE/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

                "description": "Os dois planetas estavam interligados nos destinos trágicos um do outro, dançando um rondó eterno em volta de um grande sol negro.\nNo começo, um dos planetas deu origem a humanos. Essa gente olhou para baixo e chamou a terra inferior de \"Izumo\". Essa gente olhou para cima e chamou o mundo superior de \"Takamagahara\".\nCerto dia, não registrado nos anais, os \"Deuses Inumeráveis\" desceram de Takamagahara. Essas feras demoníacas que eram chamadas de deuses viraram os céus de ponta-cabeça, queimaram os rios e mares, e fizeram a terra ruir. O povo percebeu, aterrorizado, que a invasão não era motivada por governança, domínio ou pilhagem. Os deuses malignos chegaram só para matar.\nCom o planeta à beira da morte, Izumo embarcou em uma jornada deicida, exaurindo as forças de toda a terra para assassinar a calamidade, \"Soberano do Apocalipse\", e aproveitando-se de seu corpo bestial para forjar a primeira Lâmina do Édito.\nEssas espadas fariam os deuses provarem de seu próprio veneno. Ao recitar o mantra contido na lâmina, seu portador podia dominar o poder divino de Takamagahara e usá-lo para combater os deuses malignos e salvar o povo.\nEntão, Izumo deu início a sua longa e árdua cruzada, sacrificando incontáveis vidas em troca da queda de uma divindade após a outra, e estilhaçando inúmeras lâminas mortais para forjar as doze Sentinelas.\nNa impiedosa luta pela sobrevivência, Izumo usou o poder das Lâminas do Édito para iluminar seu mundo tenebroso e incivilizado em menos de dez Eras de Âmbar, erguendo cidades deslumbrantes tomadas de luzes neon.\nO distante Reino Divino de Takama, antes tão longínquo, de repente estava ao seu alcance.\nMas então, a história parou. A existência dos dois planetas se evaporou instantaneamente, desaparecendo por completo.\nHoje em dia, o passado do planeta fronteiriço de Izumo só pode ser vislumbrado a partir de sussurros espalhados pelo universo. Não há consenso entre acadêmicos para a explicação de seu sumiço, e ninguém é capaz de solucionar o mistério.\nA História de Izumo deveria ter sido um extenso rio, mas foi decepada com um corte, e todo o seu passado e futuro desaguaram num mar vazio.\nSerá que o planeta nunca existiu, que não passou de uma invenção? Será que suas histórias nunca aconteceram, e ele apenas encalhou na praia da causalidade reversa? Será que foi só mais um experimento estarrecedor do Dr. Primitivo, ou talvez um sinal da Voracidade retornando do fim do cosmos?\nSomente o grande sol negro sabe a resposta, mas ele permanece em silêncio, calado.\nTudo o que acontece um dia chegará ao fim, e tudo o que já aconteceu sem dúvidas acontecerá de novo. O universo opera em eterna repetição sob a sua sombra, e Izumo não passa de uma nota de rodapé.\n\nProdução: miHoYo Anime\nColaboração: Fantasier Animation, RED DOG CULTURE HOUSE\nMúsica Original: HOYO-MiX\n\nVoz em inglês:\nCisne Negro: Arryn Zech\nAcheron: Allegra Clark\n\nBaixar Agora\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nSiga-nos para receber as novidades.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.PT\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaisr_pt\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

Những con ác thú dưới cái tên \"Thần\" này đã khiến bầu trời bị đảo lộn, đại dương và sông ngòi rực lửa, mặt đất sụp đổ... Con người bàng hoàng khi nhận ra rằng đó không phải là cuộc xâm lược nhằm mục đích thống trị, chi phối hay cướp bóc. Các hung thần chỉ đến để săn giết.\nTrong giây phút tồn vong, Izumo bước chân vào con đường \"Trừ Thần\", sử dụng toàn bộ sức mạnh của đất nước ngăn đại họa \"Chúa Tể Thiên Khải\", dùng thú thể kia rèn ra \"Chiếu Đao\" đầu tiên.\nTrả đũa đối phương bằng chính cách thức của họ, bằng cách đọc thần chú ẩn chứa trong lưỡi đao, người cầm đao có thể nắm giữ thần nghiệp trong lòng bàn tay, dùng điều đó để chống lại ác thần, giải cứu thế giới.\nKể từ đó đất nước Izumo bắt đầu hành trình chinh phạt lâu dài, dùng vô số sự hy sinh để đổi lấy sự sụp đổ của từng vị thần, bẻ gãy hàng ngàn thanh kiếm trên thế giới, cuối cùng họ đã đúc được mười hai thanh \"Chiếu Đao Hộ Thế\".\nCuộc chiến sinh tồn tàn khốc, trong chưa đầy mười Hổ Phách Kỷ, đất nước Izumo đã mượn sức mạnh của Chiếu Đao để thắp sáng thế giới đen tối chưa được khai hóa.\nXây dựng một thành bang rực rỡ sắc màu, thần quốc trên bầu trời chẳng thể chạm tới trong quá khứ đã gần ngay trước mắt, chỉ cần vươn tay ra là có thể chạm đến...\nNhưng lịch sử đột ngột dừng lại vào thời điểm này, và hai hành tinh trong chớp mắt đã bị xóa sổ, biến mất không một chút dấu vết.\nNgày nay, quá khứ của hành tinh biên giới \"Izumo\" chỉ có thể được lượm lặt trong những mẩu chuyện của vũ trụ. Các học giả cũng có nhiều ý kiến khác nhau về sự biến mất của nó, nhưng không ai có thể giải mã được bí ẩn.\nLịch sử của Izumo lẽ ra phải là một dòng sông chảy dài nhưng lại bị cắt đứt chỉ bằng một vết cắt, tất cả quá khứ và tương lai đều biến mất vào phía bên kia của hư vô.\nChẳng lẽ nó chưa từng tồn tại và chỉ là một câu chuyện hư cấu? Chẳng lẽ nó chưa bao giờ xảy ra, và mắc kẹt trên bờ biển đảo lộn nhân quả? Đây lại là một thí nghiệm bi thảm trên đời của \"Dr. Primitive\", hay là dấu hiệu cho sự trở lại của \"Tham Ăn\" từ nơi tận cùng dải thiên hà?\nChỉ có mặt trời lớn đen tối mới biết đáp án. Tuy nhiên, Ngài lại im lặng và chưa bao giờ nói điều gì.\nBởi vì mọi chuyện xảy ra đều phải có hồi kết, những thứ đã kết thúc sẽ lại xảy ra, vũ trụ sẽ tái diễn mãi mãi dưới bóng đen của Ngài, và Izumo chỉ là một chú thích cho dấu chấm lửng.\n\nSản xuất: miHoYo Anime\nHợp tác sản xuất: Fantasier Animation, RED DOG CULTURE HOUSE\nÂm nhạc gốc: HOYO-MiX \n\nCV Tiếng Anh:\nBlack Swan - Arryn Zech\nAcheron — Allegra Clark\n\nTải Ngay\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nTheo dõi chúng tôi để nhận thông tin mới nhất\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.VN/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

                "description": "Две планеты вплелись в трагичные судьбы друг друга, бесконечно вращаясь вокруг огромного солнца, чёрного как смоль.\nВ начале на одной из планет появились люди. Люди взглянули вниз и назвали эту землю «Идзумо». Люди взглянули вверх и назвали эмпирей над ними «Такамагахара».\nВ один день, не описанный ни в одной книге, с Такамагахара спустились Яоёродзу но ками. Эти демонические чудища, которых прозвали «ками», перевернули небесный свод, объяли огнём моря и океаны, разломили землю. Тогда люди в ужасе поняли, что боги вторглись на их планету не для того, чтобы править или захватывать. Ками пришли, чтобы убивать.\nНа краю гибели Идзумо отправилась в карательный поход на ками. Не щадя сил, люди пытались искоренить бедствия, ниспосланные Жнецом, и в конечном итоге смогли отлить из его звериного тела самый первый Клинок Завета.\nЧтобы отплатить ками сполна за их злодеяния, кузнец зачитал над своими клинками заклинание, которое даровало тому, кто держал клинок, божественную силу Такамагахары для борьбы против демонов и спасения всего рода людского.\nТак начался тяжёлый и затяжной поход государства Идзумо, и много жизней было отдано на уничтожение ками, одного за другим. Из тысяч поломанных в бою клинков, которыми орудовали смертные, было отлито двенадцать Хранителей.\nВ кровопролитной войне за выживание жителям Идзумо понадобилось менее десяти янтарных эр, чтобы с помощью силы Клинка Завета осветить кромешный мрак их обездоленного мира и построить чудесные города, сверкающие в неоновых огнях.\nМечта о божественном государстве Такама, которая казалась недостижимой, должна была вот-вот исполниться,\nно этой истории пришёл внезапный конец - обе планеты исчезли, канув в небытие.\nСегодня о прошлом приграничной планеты Идзумо можно услышать лишь разрозненные шепотки, развеянные по вселенной. Учёные высказывают разные предположения о причинах исчезновения этой цивилизации, но никому пока не удалось разгадать эту загадку до конца.\nИстория Идзумо должна была течь тихой водой, но её поток был разрублен одним ударом. Всё прошлое и будущее этого мира осталось на том берегу звенящей пустоты.\nА существовал ли он вовсе, или это простые сказки? Возможно, этой истории и не было, или её следствия на самом деле служили причиной? Быть может, это очередной злодейский эксперимент доктора Примитива, или знамение о возвращении Эона Ненасытности с окраин космоса?\nВсё рано или поздно заканчивается, и всё начинается сызнова.\nВселенная идёт по кругу в тени Эонов, и Идзумо лишь сноска к многоточию...\n\nПроизводство: miHoYo Anime\nПроизведено совместно с Fantasier Animation, RED DOG CULTURE HOUSE\nОригинальное музыкальное сопровождение: HOYO-MiX\n\nАнглийские CV:\nЧёрный Лебедь - Arryn Zech\nАхерон - Allegra Clark\n\nЗагрузить сейчас\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nСледите за нашими последними новостями\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nВКонтакте: https://vk.com/honkaistarrail_official\nTelegram: https://t.me/honkaistarrailofficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Ахерон"

                "description": "Les planètes jumelles étaient enchevêtrées dans leur destin tragique, dansant un rondo éternel autour d'un grand soleil noir.\nAu commencement, l'une des planètes vit naître des humains. Ces êtres regardèrent en bas et nommèrent cette terre « Izumo ». Ils levèrent les yeux et nommèrent le monde au-dessus « Takamagahara ».\nLors d'un jour non consigné dans les chroniques, de nombreuses divinités descendirent de Takamagahara. Des bêtes maléfiques nommées par les dieux renversèrent les cieux, embrasèrent les rivières et les océans, et déchirèrent la terre. Les hommes comprirent, terrifiés, que cette invasion n'avait pas pour but la conquête, la domination, ni le pillage, mais l'extermination.\nFaisant face à une extinction imminente, Izumo s'engagea dans une entreprise déicide, mobilisant toute sa force pour terrasser la calamité connue sous le nom de « Souverain de la Révélation » et forger la toute première Lame de l'édit à partir de son corps bestial.\nCeux qui maniaient ces épées pouvaient dès lors rendre à ces dieux maléfiques la monnaie de leur pièce : en récitant les mantras contenus dans leurs lames, ils étaient capables de manipuler le pouvoir divin de Takamagahara, ce qui leur permettait de combattre ces divinités malveillantes et de venir au secours du peuple.\nAinsi commença la longue croisade d'Izumo, qui fut marquée par d'innombrables sacrifices pour abattre une divinité après l'autre et brisant d'innombrables lames mortelles afin de forger les Douze protectrices.\nDans cette lutte acharnée pour sa survie, Izumo utilisa la puissance des Lames de l'édit pour illuminer ce monde ténébreux primitif en moins de dix ères de l'Ambre, érigeant des cités rayonnant de mille couleurs...\nLe lointain royaume divin de Takama, jadis si éloigné, était désormais à portée de main.\nPourtant, c'est à ce moment-là que cette histoire prit soudainement fin. Ces deux planètes virent leur existence s'évaporer, disparaissant dans le néant.\nAujourd'hui, l'histoire d'Izumo, cette planète frontalière, ne survit que par des murmures dispersés à travers l'univers. Les universitaires ont diverses opinions concernant sa disparition, mais aucun n'a réussi à percer ce mystère.\nL'histoire d'Izumo aurait dû être un long fleuve, mais elle a été tranchée d'un seul coup, et son passé et son futur ont été effacés dans les rives du néant.\nIzumo n'a-t-elle jamais existé, n'était-ce qu'une histoire fabriquée ? Ses récits se sont-ils échoués sur les rives d'une causalité inversée ? Était-ce une autre expérience terrifiante de Dr Primitif, ou était-ce un signe du Retour de la Voracité depuis les confins du Cosmos ?\nSeul ce grand soleil noir détient la réponse. Mais il garde le silence.\nCar tout événement passé finira par retrouver son dénouement, et tout ce qui s'est terminé est destiné à se répéter. L'univers est voué à une éternelle répétition dans son ombre. Quant à Izumo, elle n'est plus qu'une simple note de bas de page, complémentant une ellipse.\n\nProduction : miHoYo Anime\nCo-Production : Fantasier Animation, RED DOG CULTURE HOUSE\nMusique originale : HOYO-MiX\n\nVoix anglaises :\nCygne noir : Arryn Zech\nAchéron : Allegra Clark\n\nTélécharger maintenant\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nSuivez-nous pour être au courant des toutes dernières informations sur le jeu !\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.FR/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Achéron"

These people looked down, and named the land below \"Izumo.\" These people looked up, and named the world above \"Takamagahara.\"\nOne day uninscribed in the annals, the Yaoyorozu-no-kami descended from Takamagahara. These demonic beasts named Kami overturned the skies, burned the rivers and oceans, and shattered the land — People realized in horror that it was not an invasion for rulership, dominance, or plunder. The evil Kami came only to kill.\nAs the planet stood on the brink of death, Izumo embarked on a Kami-slaying journey, exhausting the might of the entire country to slay the calamity \"Sovereign of Revelation\" and forging the very first Edict Edge using its bestial body.\nGiving the Kami a taste of their own medicine, the wielder of these swords can recite the mantra contained within the blade to master the divine power of Takamagahara, and use it to combat the evil Kami and save the masses.\nFrom then on, Izumo started its long and arduous crusade, exchanging inordinate lives lost for the fall of one Kami after another, shattering countless mortal blades to forge the twelve Sentinels.\nIn the merciless fight for survival, Izumo used the might of the Edict Edges to light up their uncivilized world of darkness in less than ten Amber Eras, building cities of dazzling neon lights.\nThat distant Takama Divine Realm, once so far away, became so close within their reach —\nYet history suddenly stopped there. The existence of the two planets instantly evaporated, disappearing into nothingness.\nNowadays, the past of the border planet Izumo can only be gleaned from the scattered whispers in the universe. Academics hold various views regarding its disappearance, but none can solve the mystery.\nIzumo's history should have been a long flowing river, but it was severed in one cut, and all its past and future voided on emptiness' other shore.\nDid it never exist, and was it no more than a fabricated story? Did its histories never occur, and it ran aground on the beach of reverse causation? Was it yet another appalling experiment by Dr. Primitive, or was it a sign of the Voracity returning from the end of the Cosmos?\nOnly that pitch-black great sun knows the answer, yet THEY remain silent, never speaking.\nBecause everything that had happened will one day regress to the end, and everything that had ended is guaranteed to happen again.

Mereka menundukkan kepala dan menyebut tanah di bawah kaki mereka sebagai \"Izumo\", lalu mereka mengangkat kepala dan menyebut dunia di langit sebagai \"Takamagahara\".\nPada suatu hari yang tak tercatat dalam catatan sejarah, \"Yaoyorozu no Kami\" turun dari \"Takamagahara\". Binatang jahat yang disebut \"Kami\" ini menjungkirbalikkan langit, membakar sungai dan lautan, serta menghancurkan daratan ... Orang-orang terkejut saat menyadari invasi ini bukanlah untuk menguasai, mendominasi, ataupun menjarah, melainkan hanya untuk pembasmian.\nSaat planet ini berada di ambang kematian, Izumo memulai perjalanan pembasmian \"Kami\", menghabiskan kekuatan seluruh negeri untuk membasmi \"Sovereign of Revelation\" yang membawa malapetaka dan menempa Edict Edge pertama menggunakan tubuh binatang tersebut.\nMembuat para \"Kami\" merasakan perbuatan mereka sendiri, pengguna pedang ini dapat melafalkan mantra yang terkandung di dalam pedang untuk menguasai kekuatan suci Takamagahara, dan menggunakannya untuk melawan para \"Kami\" jahat dan menyelamatkan negeri.\nSejak saat itu, Izumo memulai penaklukan yang panjang, pengorbanan yang tidak terhitung jumlahnya dilakukan sebagai bayaran atas jatuhnya para \"Kami\" satu demi satu, dan menghancurkan ribuan pedang manusia fana yang tak terhitung jumlahnya untuk membentuk 12 \"Sentinel\".\nDalam perang kejam untuk bertahan hidup, Izumo menggunakan kekuatan Edict Edge untuk menerangi dunia gelap yang tidak beradab dalam waktu kurang dari sepuluh Era Amber, membangun kota-kota dengan lampu neon yang memesona.\nTakama Divine Realm yang dulunya begitu sulit dijangkau jadi begitu dekat dalam jangkauan mereka ....\nTapi sejarah tiba-tiba berhenti di situ dan keberadaan kedua planet tersebut menghilang ke dalam ketiadaan dalam sekejap mata.\nSekarang ini, masa lalu planet perbatasan \"Izumo\" hanya dapat ditemukan dari bisikan-bisikan yang tersebar di alam semesta. Para ahli mempunyai berbagai pandangan mengenai hilangnya planet tersebut, tapi tidak ada yang bisa memecahkan misterinya.\nSejarah Izumo seharusnya merupakan sebuah sungai yang mengalir panjang, tapi sungai itu terpotong dalam satu tebasan, semua masa lalu dan masa depannya lenyap di sisi lain ketiadaan.\nApakah sungai itu tidak pernah ada, dan hanya sekadar cerita fiktif? Apakah sejarahnya tidak pernah ada dan ia kandas di pantai sebab akibat yang terbalik? Apakah ini merupakan eksperimen mengerikan lainnya yang dilakukan oleh \"Dr. Primitive\", atau apakah ini merupakan pertanda kembalinya \"Voracity\" dari ujung alam semesta?\nHanya matahari gelap itu yang tahu jawabannya, tapi \"Dia\" hanya diam dan tidak pernah bicara.\nKarena segala sesuatu yang telah terjadi suatu hari nanti akan mengalami kemunduran hingga akhir, dan segala sesuatu yang telah berakhir dijamin akan terjadi lagi. Alam semesta mengalami pengulangan abadi di bawah bayang-bayang-Nya, dan Izumo tidak lebih dari catatan kaki untuk elipsis.\n\nDipersembahkan oleh: miHoYo Anime\nKolaborasi bersama: Fantasier Animation, RED DOG CULTURE HOUSE\nMusik asli: HOYO-MiX\n\nCV Bahasa Inggris:\nBlack Swan — Arryn Zech\nAcheron — Allegra Clark\n\nUnduh Sekarang\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nIkuti akun medsos kami untuk mendapatkan info terbaru\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HonkaiStarRail.ID/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram:https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

                "description": "Entrelazados están los trágicos destinos de dos planetas, danzando eternamente alrededor de un sol negro.\nAl principio, uno de esos planetas dio origen a la humanidad. Esas personas inclinaron la cabeza y llamaron a la tierra bajo sus pies Izumo. Después miraron hacia arriba y llamaron al cielo sobre sus cabezas Takamagahara.\nEn algún día no registrado en los anales de historia, los Kami Innumerables descendieron de Takamagahara. Esas bestias malévolas con nombres divinos hicieron caer el cielo, quemaron las aguas y despedazaron la tierra. La humanidad se dio cuenta de que no era una invasión para gobernar, dominar o saquear; los kami malvados solo venían a matar.\nEn su lucha por la supervivencia, Izumo se embarcó en una campaña para acabar con ellos, usando el poder de toda la nación para acabar con la calamidad llamada Soberano de la Revelación, y usaron su cuerpo bestial para forjar la primera espada del decreto.\nDevolviéndoles la jugada a los kami, recitaron los mantras contenidos en las espadas, para que aquellos que las empuñaban pudiesen desafiar a los kami de Takamagahara y salvar a la humanidad de la maldad divina.\nAsí comenzó la larga cruzada de Izumo, en la que se sacrificaron innumerables vidas para derrocar a un kami tras otro, y en la que se rompieron innumerables espadas para forjar las doce Espadas Protectoras.\nEn la cruel lucha por la supervivencia, Izumo utilizó el poder de las espadas del decreto para iluminar el oscuro mundo aún sin civilizar, erigiendo brillantes ciudades en menos de diez Eras del Ámbar.\nEl reino divino de Takama, otrora tan lejano, estaba a punto de ser alcanzado.\nPero la historia llegó a su fin abruptamente. Los dos planetas desaparecieron de la noche a la mañana, sin dejar rastro.\nHoy en día, el pasado del remoto planeta Izumo solo se encuentra en fragmentos dispersos en el cosmos. Los estudiosos tienen diversas teorías sobre su desaparición, pero el misterio sigue sin resolverse.\nLa historia de Izumo debería haber sido un largo río, pero se cortó de un solo tajo, y todo su pasado y futuro desaparecieron en el vacío.\n¿Acaso nunca existió, acaso solo fue una fábula inventada? ¿Acaso nunca ocurrió, acaso fue una historia abandonada a la orilla de la causalidad inversa? ¿Fue otro cruel experimento del Dr. Primitivo, o un presagio del regreso de la Voracidad desde los confines de la galaxia?\nSolo el sol negro sabe la respuesta. Sin embargo, guarda silencio, sin decir una palabra.\nPorque todo lo que sucede está destinado a terminar, y todo lo que ha terminado está destinado a suceder nuevamente. El universo regresa eternamente bajo su sombra, e Izumo es solo una nota al pie de página.\n\nProducción: miHoYo Anime\nEn colaboración con: Fantasier Animation, RED DOG CULTURE HOUSE\nMúsica original: HOYO-MiX\n\n\nVoces en inglés:\nCisne Negro: Arryn Zech\nAcheron: Allegra Clark\n\nDescargar ahora\nhttps://hoyo.link/dVDhFDAL\n\nSíguenos para enterarte de las últimas novedades.\nHoYoLAB: https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=172534910\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/honkaistarrailES/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/honkaisr_es\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/honkaistarrail\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/honkaistarrail/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@honkaistarrail_official\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/\n\n#HonkaiStarRail\n#Acheron"

A friend of the channel, Paul Braren, invited me into his house to check out his setup. Both his system and my system were installed last year, so I thought it’d be really interesting to compare the two, the reasons why we did what we did, the costs, and our initial thoughts.

            "description": "She will return with a vengeance. Furiosa : A Mad Max Saga - Only in theaters May 24.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth star in Academy Award-winning mastermind George Miller’s “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” the much-anticipated return to the iconic dystopian world he created more than 30 years ago with the seminal “Mad Max” films.  Miller now turns the page again with an all-new original, standalone action adventure that will reveal the origins of the powerhouse character from the multiple Oscar-winning global smash “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  The new feature from Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures is produced by Miller and his longtime partner, Oscar-nominated producer Doug Mitchell (“Mad Max: Fury Road,” “Babe”), under their Australian-based Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner. \nAs the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus.  Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.  While the two Tyrants war for dominance, Furiosa must survive many trials as she puts together the means to find her way home.\nTaylor-Joy stars in the title role, and along with Hemsworth, the film also stars Alyla Browne and Tom Burke. \nMiller penned the script with “Mad Max: Fury Road” co-writer Nico Lathouris.  Miller’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris, director of photography Simon Duggan (“Hacksaw Ridge,” “The Great Gatsby”), composer Tom Holkenborg, sound designer Robert Mackenzie, editor Eliot Knapman, visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson and colorist Eric Whipp. The team also includes other longtime collaborators: production designer Colin Gibson, editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, costume designer Jenny Beavan and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, each of whom won an Oscar for their work on “Mad Max: Fury Road.” \nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, A Kennedy Miller Mitchell Production, A George Miller Film, “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, in theaters only nationwide on May 24, 2024 and internationally beginning on 22 May, 2024.",

            "description": "It's hard to believe it's been almost 5 years of creating these videos. If you've been here since the beginning, I'm sure you've seen how much we've changed and grown in that time...part of that growth has been internal work that is often difficult to see. As we set new expectations for what our channel looks like going forward, it will allow us to show up in a more impactful and thoughtful way not just in our own lives but in the videos that we share with you. Also, if you’re located in Nova Scotia it’s totally worth checking out EfficiencyNS. We’re really excited to get this report back and see how we can make the cabin more efficient! https://www.EfficiencyNS.ca \n\nIf you've missed the last few episodes, we decided to buy a cabin, move into it and get comfortable for the winter. It has been a LONG 4 years of self building our home and it's time we start living again. Now that it's been a few weeks, this cozy cottage is exactly what our souls needed! \n\nWatch our weekly podcast (every Wednesday)\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@tangentswithtylerandtodd\n\nFollow us on Instagram: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd\n\nJoin our Patreon Community: \nhttps://bit.ly/TylerandTodd-Patreon\n\nHow did we end up here? \nIt all began with a year of full-time travel, embracing the van life until the world shifted, and we had to adjust accordingly. With travel no longer an option but determined to stay productive, we transformed our compact mobile abode into a self-sufficient off-grid dwelling that fulfilled all our needs. Recognizing the uncertainty of the current tiny home, we quickly realized a permanent residence was the most sensible choice. Over the past three years, we have meticulously overseen every aspect of the project ourselves, planning the construction while simultaneously setting up the off-grid property to sustain our future food requirements. For the last two years we've lived in a Geodesic Dome, which has allowed us to be comfortable (expect for the winter months), while we realize our shipping container home dream. However, this will mark our 4th winter with stable electricity, running water, or a flushing toilet and time has come to come up with a new plan going forward.\n\nMusicbed SyncID:\nMB01BIM5USYLM1W",

            "description": "Stephen Thompson | March 15, 2024\nWalking into the room shortly before Justin Timberlake took our cramped stage, I overheard someone on his team wondering aloud if this was to be the most densely populated Tiny Desk concert in history — which is to say, the most musicians we've ever fit in a single frame. It's not, but we don't often find a way to cram in this many human beings (15 in all) and this much gear.\n\nTimberlake has never been one to give partial effort, but this is a production befitting the occasion: namely, a set timed to drop concurrently with the release of his new album, Everything I Thought It Was. Eschewing the rootsier feel of its predecessor, 2018's Man of the Woods, the new record is a throwback, an epic and a blowout — and so's this lavish set, which scales the Timberlake experience down to 25 minutes of maximalist celebration and, when the moment calls for it, chiller vibes.\n\nBacked by his band The Tennessee Kids, Timberlake's Tiny Desk debut leans heavily on his early solo catalog, as he kicks it off with two songs from 2002's classic Justified and weaves in three more from 2006's magnificent FutureSex/LoveSounds — including a set-closing \"SexyBack,\" which finds the singer trotting out a megaphone in a truly meme-worthy moment.\n\nBy the way, in case you're wondering, the all-time record for musicians behind the Tiny Desk is a whopping 23, a feat pulled off by the fantastic Mucca Pazza in 2015. But Timberlake and company rival that classic performance's energy — in both cases, the real triumph lies not in the Tetris of it all, but in the way that many people still find ways to move, buoyantly and as one mighty organism.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Señorita\"\n\"Rock Your Body\"\n\"Pusher Love Girl\"\n\"Until The End Of Time\"\n\"Selfish\"\n\"What Goes Around\"\n\"SexyBack\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJustin Timberlake: lead vocals, guitar, keys\nRaVaughn Brown: vocals\nCamry: vocals\nErin Stevenson: vocals\nKenyon Dixon: vocals\nJustin Gilbert: keys\nMike Reid: drums\nElliot Ives: guitar\nDerrick Ray: bass\nLeon Silva: saxophone\nKevin Williams: trombone, flute\nDontae Winslow: trumpet\nSean Erick: trumpet\nAdam Blackstone: keys, percussion, music direction\nAndrew Hypes: DJ\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Alanté Serene, Elizabeth Gillis\nAudio Engineers: Kwesi Lee, Adam Blackstone, Danny Cheung\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Estefania Mitre\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#justintimberlake #nprmusic #tinydesk",

It's the idea of pure unadulterated freedom, living free from the shackles of responsibility, regulation, and reality. On a lone vessel dancing along the waves of a vast ocean, the world is truly your oyster, and the possibilities are endless! This swashbuckling fantasy has been fueled time and time again by classics like Pirates of the Caribbean in the early 2000s, Treasure Island in the late 1800s, and A General History of the Pyrates in the early 1700s. So considering how impactful the pirate genre has been on the greater populace, it might come as a shock to learn that our understanding of real pirate history is relatively meager. That last listed classic, A General History of the Pyrates by Captain Charles Johnson, remains one of our most primary sources for pirate history during the Golden Age, a novel which we know to have exaggerated and stretched the truth for sensational effect. While unfortunate, it does make sense that accurate recordings of the true history of piracy are scarce given the criminal and elusive nature of pirates themselves. One isn't really an efficient criminal by making their personal information as known as possible. Combine that with the fact that most pirates came from poverty and low social status, and the fact that many primary court documents have been lost to time, it makes sense that this history can be hard to accurately map and result in much speculation. In this video, much speculation must be made to connect the dots we have about Stede Bonnet's life for example. Naturally, this can lead to inaccurate assumptions, so with that in mind I tried my best to choose language carefully when telling this story. Take note of the numerous sentences initiated with, \"It's believed\" for some insight into when speculations are made. \n\nThe illusiveness of pirate history feeds into the fantasy. After all, these were criminals, and if we could go back in time and ask them, we'd find many of them wouldn't choose this way of life if given the choice. The story of piracy is the story of class struggle, with rare exceptions like Bonnet aside, the lowest rungs of society were the ones who populated the pirate ranks. Poor sailors who lost their livelihood, impressment victims seeking freedom, privateers losing their state-backed support, and those with nowhere to turn but the sea were the ones who became pirates. It's a position born out of struggle and poverty, the same struggle that can be seen with the Somali pirates in the modern day. In essence, they are no different than the glorified pirates of the Caribbean: disadvantaged victims of society merely doing what they can to survive. \n\nWorks Consulted / Read More: \n\n(Will add later)",

It's the idea of pure unadulterated freedom, living free from the shackles of responsibility, regulation, and reality. On a lone vessel dancing along the waves of a vast ocean, the world is truly your oyster, and the possibilities are endless! This swashbuckling fantasy has been fueled time and time again by classics like Pirates of the Caribbean in the early 2000s, Treasure Island in the late 1800s, and A General History of the Pyrates in the early 1700s. So considering how impactful the pirate genre has been on the greater populace, it might come as a shock to learn that our understanding of real pirate history is relatively meager. That last listed classic, A General History of the Pyrates by Captain Charles Johnson, remains one of our most primary sources for pirate history during the Golden Age, a novel which we know to have exaggerated and stretched the truth for sensational effect. While unfortunate, it does make sense that accurate recordings of the true history of piracy are scarce given the criminal and elusive nature of pirates themselves. One isn't really an efficient criminal by making their personal information as known as possible. Combine that with the fact that most pirates came from poverty and low social status, and the fact that many primary court documents have been lost to time, it makes sense that this history can be hard to accurately map and result in much speculation. In this video, much speculation must be made to connect the dots we have about Stede Bonnet's life for example. Naturally, this can lead to inaccurate assumptions, so with that in mind I tried my best to choose language carefully when telling this story. Take note of the numerous sentences initiated with, \"It's believed\" for some insight into when speculations are made. \n\nThe illusiveness of pirate history feeds into the fantasy. After all, these were criminals, and if we could go back in time and ask them, we'd find many of them wouldn't choose this way of life if given the choice. The story of piracy is the story of class struggle, with rare exceptions like Bonnet aside, the lowest rungs of society were the ones who populated the pirate ranks. Poor sailors who lost their livelihood, impressment victims seeking freedom, privateers losing their state-backed support, and those with nowhere to turn but the sea were the ones who became pirates. It's a position born out of struggle and poverty, the same struggle that can be seen with the Somali pirates in the modern day. In essence, they are no different than the glorified pirates of the Caribbean: disadvantaged victims of society merely doing what they can to survive. \n\nWorks Consulted / Read More: \n\n(Will add later)"
