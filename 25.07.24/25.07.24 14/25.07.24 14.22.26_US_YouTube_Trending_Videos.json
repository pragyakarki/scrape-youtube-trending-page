Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Akon\n\n[Intro: T-Pain]\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: T-Pain]\nBroke up with my girl last night so I went to the club (So I went to the club)\nPut on a fresh white suit and the mini-coupe sittin' on dubs (Sittin' on dubs)\nI'm just lookin' for somebody to talk to and show me some love (Show me some love)\nIf you know what I mean, uh-huh\nEverybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)\nTwo hundred bi***es in the building, ain't none of them hot (Ain't none of them hot)\nExcept for this pretty young thang that was workin' on the way, at the top (On the way, at the top)\nShawty, what is your name?\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd I think she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe hit it off somethin' proper like\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 2: T-Pain]\nGot a brand new girl so I'm feelin' all good inside (All good inside)\nFeel like I put some brand new twenty-fours on a brand new ride (On a brand new ride)\nTriple shot of Patron on the rocks with a little bit of lime (With a little bit of lime)\nI'm just keepin' it real, uh-huh\nBaby still workin' at the club so I'm gettin' in free (So I'm gettin' in free)\nWednesday night, I'm on the list, T-Pain plus three (T-Pain plus three)\nEvery time I hit the spot babygirl takin' care of me (Takin' care of me)\nHow do you think I feel?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 3: Akon & T-Pain]\nShorty, I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out (Ever come out)\n'Less I'm in the M6, doin' tricks, freeway burnt out (Freeway burnt out)\nGot a passenger side that's empty wantin' it to be your spot (Be your stop)\nPut you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top (And I end up on top)\nDon't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby (Baby)\nJust lookin' at you from a distance, lookin' like a goddamn star baby (Baby)\nSo my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car? (Those keys to the car)\n'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorrow (I'll see you tomorrow)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Akon]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know, she thinks I'm cool (She thinks I'm cool)\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back (Uh-huh)\nAnd then I think that (Uh-huh)\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight (Oh, yeah, slide)\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\nTags\nbartender,bartender lyrics,lyrics bartender,t pain,akon,lyrics,t pain bartender,bartender t pain,t pain bartender lyrics,lyrics t pain bartender,t pain lyrics,lyrics t pain,t pain lyrics bartender,bartender t pain lyrics,akon bartender,bartender akon,akon bartender lyrics,lyrics akon bartender,akon lyrics,lyrics bartender akon,bartender akon lyrics,t pain akon bartender,t pain akon bartender lyrics,I like the bartender,I'm at the bar with her,music,rap\n\n#tpain #bartender #akon #lyrics",

Akon\n\n[Intro: T-Pain]\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: T-Pain]\nBroke up with my girl last night so I went to the club (So I went to the club)\nPut on a fresh white suit and the mini-coupe sittin' on dubs (Sittin' on dubs)\nI'm just lookin' for somebody to talk to and show me some love (Show me some love)\nIf you know what I mean, uh-huh\nEverybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)\nTwo hundred bi***es in the building, ain't none of them hot (Ain't none of them hot)\nExcept for this pretty young thang that was workin' on the way, at the top (On the way, at the top)\nShawty, what is your name?\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd I think she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe hit it off somethin' proper like\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 2: T-Pain]\nGot a brand new girl so I'm feelin' all good inside (All good inside)\nFeel like I put some brand new twenty-fours on a brand new ride (On a brand new ride)\nTriple shot of Patron on the rocks with a little bit of lime (With a little bit of lime)\nI'm just keepin' it real, uh-huh\nBaby still workin' at the club so I'm gettin' in free (So I'm gettin' in free)\nWednesday night, I'm on the list, T-Pain plus three (T-Pain plus three)\nEvery time I hit the spot babygirl takin' care of me (Takin' care of me)\nHow do you think I feel?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know she thinks I'm cool\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\n[Verse 3: Akon & T-Pain]\nShorty, I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out (Ever come out)\n'Less I'm in the M6, doin' tricks, freeway burnt out (Freeway burnt out)\nGot a passenger side that's empty wantin' it to be your spot (Be your stop)\nPut you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top (And I end up on top)\nDon't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby (Baby)\nJust lookin' at you from a distance, lookin' like a goddamn star baby (Baby)\nSo my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car? (Those keys to the car)\n'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorrow (I'll see you tomorrow)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain & Akon]\nOoh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk\nAnd now I know, she thinks I'm cool (She thinks I'm cool)\nShe gave me a wink, I winked back (Uh-huh)\nAnd then I think that (Uh-huh)\nWe gon' have fun at my spot tonight (Oh, yeah, slide)\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nI like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\nI like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)\nI'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)\n\nTags\nbartender,bartender lyrics,lyrics bartender,t pain,akon,lyrics,t pain bartender,bartender t pain,t pain bartender lyrics,lyrics t pain bartender,t pain lyrics,lyrics t pain,t pain lyrics bartender,bartender t pain lyrics,akon bartender,bartender akon,akon bartender lyrics,lyrics akon bartender,akon lyrics,lyrics bartender akon,bartender akon lyrics,t pain akon bartender,t pain akon bartender lyrics,I like the bartender,I'm at the bar with her,music,rap\n\n#tpain #bartender #akon #lyrics"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­-to-­be­-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #RobloxForsaken #Forsaken #RobloxHorror #Horror #xDemon #Goobers",

The game features cross-platform play between Windows-based personal computers and Xbox One video game consoles. A group of players travel and explore an open world via a pirate ship and assume different roles such as steering, hoisting sails, navigation, and firing cannons. Players embark on quests, collect loot and engage in combat with other players. Sea of Thieves is a shared game world, which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly throughout their adventures.\n\nWhen I make Sea of Thieves videos you will find funny gaming moments, intense PVP, exciting action sequences and daring escapades in this 2025 pirate simulator. I take on many enemies as a pirate on the ocean to become a Pirate Legend.\n\n\nSpecs:\n\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\nRAM: 96GB DDR4-3200 RAM\nVideo Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 4090\n4 TB M Drive\n20 TB Hard Drive",

The game features cross-platform play between Windows-based personal computers and Xbox One video game consoles. A group of players travel and explore an open world via a pirate ship and assume different roles such as steering, hoisting sails, navigation, and firing cannons. Players embark on quests, collect loot and engage in combat with other players. Sea of Thieves is a shared game world, which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly throughout their adventures.\n\nWhen I make Sea of Thieves videos you will find funny gaming moments, intense PVP, exciting action sequences and daring escapades in this 2025 pirate simulator. I take on many enemies as a pirate on the ocean to become a Pirate Legend.\n\n\nSpecs:\n\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\nRAM: 96GB DDR4-3200 RAM\nVideo Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 4090\n4 TB M Drive\n20 TB Hard Drive"
