cuñado le mandé una combi de Hugo Boss \nY Ella es feliz conmigo le compré aló y en miu miu un abrigo\nYo no le transfiero le doy efectivo par de gafitas Cartier y su polvo respectivo \n\nCoro Blessd \nNos vamos de shopping donde quieras mucho Gucci cartera con los diamantes afuera y en el jet pa Miami pa que veas las palmeras\nNos vamos de shopping donde quieras mucho Gucci cartera con los diamantes afuera y en el jet pa Miami pa que veas las palmeras\n\nGeezy \nMi amor ya estamos melos ya los carros prenden por botones \nLe di pal emprendimiento y pa las vacaciones\nYo te regalo el álbum dale cobra millones\nLo que valió un apartamento lo tiene en los tacones\nEl suegro me tenía la mala ya hablando pidiendo saludos\nLos polvitos en la suite con aire para que no sude\nLas prendas uno de uno no, no hay similitudes \nY la Glock por si tu ex sigue con las inquietudes\nEn la pared para no despelucarlo \nVivo dentro del estudio para que tú estés de Rose en Montecarlos \nEse billete hay que pesarlo pa contarlo\nNo chimbees por tiempo que tengo que trabajar para disfrutarlo\n\nBlessd Coro\nNos vamos de shopping donde quieras mucho Gucci cartera con los diamantes afuera y en el jet pa Miami pa que veas las palmeras\nNos vamos de shopping donde quieras mucho Gucci cartera con los diamantes afuera y en el jet pa Miami pa que veas las palmeras\n\nTury \nQuiero comprarte unas Van Cleef de esas que usa mi mamá\nPrimera clase pa Madrid en el estudio lo hice real, muñeca \nEl roce en ADV es por Pedregal\nFoticos en República tu en pelota  viendo el mar\nEse pirobo no te gasta qué pereza\nY tú y yo culiando en Guatapé un blunt viendo la represa \nLos conjuntos Gucci mi amor conmigo te ves más fresa\nEn la Mercedes los Piquitos y el granizado de cereza\nConmigo viajecito por París y Mónaco\nPerfiladita le operé hasta la nariz\nYa no es más Mazda 2 ahora es MERCHO con Bodykey \nCámbialo y volamos el mundo por ahí\n\nKris R \nMami lo que usted pida por esa boquita\nSi quiere me pita si quiere le llego ahorita\nPa usted tengo todo el tiempo disponible\nAmor es que es increíble que en tampoco tiempo esto haga sentirme\nMe tienes sonriéndole a la pantalla si me escribes y me llamas \nYo voy pa donde tú vayas tú vas pa donde yo vaya \nAsí es lo de nosotros mutuo\nDisfruto verte mami así sólo sea un minuto\nQue si me gustas claro, ma la respuesta obvia\nEso no se pregunta por encima se me nota\nMi mujer mi novia en todo me apoya contigo me siento en confi, contigo ni uso los Troya \nMe vuelve loco desde peladito\nContigo este año me tomo las fotos en Navidad en el arbolito\nSubo historias con los temas que le he escrito\nSabe que la ella escribi el verso del tema cositas con el bendito \n\nBlessd \nPrendo un Jeeter \nPa qué fumemos mi amor\nYo quiero comprar tu tiempo\nPero tú prefieres un reloj \nPero eso no es un problema conmigo vas a la fija\nYo te lleno de cadena de pulseras y de sortijas\nLo hacemos en el privado y Hermes es la cobija\nCómo Kris R eres el sentimiento de esta valija\n\nPa mi chimbita lo mejor iPhone 17 la monte en AMG le cambié el Mazda 2 \nY pa quedar parado al cuñado le mandé una combi de Hugo Boss \nY Ella es feliz conmigo le compré aló y en miu miu un abrigo\nYo no le transfiero le doy efectivo par de gafitas Cartier y su polvo respectivo \n\nCarabin3\nQué va a querer que va a pedir que va a llevar\nPida lo que quiera que hoy estoy dispuesto a todo gastar\nYo me salí de la calle y ahora contigo puedo estar \nCamellando en el estudio pa Europa te voy a llegar  \nVamos pa Celine beba \nVámonos pa Cartagena desde que te vi supe que ya no eras ajena \nSubías fotos a la historia pa que te la respondieras \nY ya te tengo aquí en mi cama haciendo lo que yo quiera \nSi estamos solos todo ignoro \nCuándo estás encima de mí Perdemos la noción de todo te encanta como en la cama lo entregamos todo\nLo que me pidas maa lo voy a gastar \nContigo por ti lo dejo todo ya no quiero ser tu amigo de Channel o Balenciaaa\nTe voa perchar \nEntera \nEres mi mujer mami ya no eres cualquiera \n\nYoung Fatty \nMami pide lo que quieras el pago esta tarjetiau \nEn la Gwa nos comimos sin vidrios

Get tickets now.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy’s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town’s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike’s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy’s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy’s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

            "description": "New creatures. New era. Experience the Ice Age like never before. Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age premieres November 26 on Apple TV https://apple.co/_PrehistoricPlanet\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” is a sweeping new installment of the award-winning natural history series from executive producers Jon Favreau and Mike Gunton, produced by BBC Studios Natural History Unit (“Planet Earth”), and narrated by Golden Globe Award and Olivier Award winner Tom Hiddleston (“Earthsounds”), with an original score by Hans Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve from Bleeding Fingers Music. The five-part docuseries, set to premiere globally on November 26, 2025, invites viewers into a dramatic new era of prehistoric life, millions of years after the extinction of the dinosaurs — an era shaped by ice, the intense fight to survive and the rise of a new cast of giants: the iconic megafauna.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” uses the latest scientific research and cutting-edge visual effects to bring this frozen world to life like never before, unveiling the spectacular habitats and inhabitants of ancient Earth for a one-of-a-kind experience. From towering woolly mammoths to elusive snow sloths, terrifying saber-toothed tigers to resilient dwarf elephants (only 3 feet tall), the series reveals the epic struggles and unexpected stories of animals that once ruled the Ice Age. Viewers will journey through vast tundras, barren deserts, expanding grasslands and melting permafrost as these creatures battle for survival in the face of extreme climates, shifting landscapes and the onset of “The Big Freeze,” and ultimately, “The Big Melt.”\n\nThe series is produced by the world-renowned team at BBC Studios Natural History Unit with support from the photorealistic visual effects of Framestore (“Gravity,” “The Golden Compass”). Theme by Hans Zimmer, with an original score by Zimmer, Anže Rozman and Kara Talve for Bleeding Fingers Music.\n\n“Prehistoric Planet: Ice Age” continues the storytelling journey of the acclaimed Apple TV natural history series “Prehistoric Planet,” which transported viewers 66 million years into the past to witness the age of dinosaurs across two seasons. Blending cinematic storytelling with photorealistic visual effects, the series brings ancient worlds to life, offering a firsthand look at some of the most extraordinary creatures ever to walk the Earth.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

                "description": "It wouldn't be the holidays without a bit of chaos. #OhWhatFunMovie premieres December 3 on Prime Video.\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n\nAbout Oh. What. Fun.:\nClaire Clauster (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the glue that holds her chaotic, lovable family together every holiday season. From perfectly frosted cookies to meticulously wrapped gifts, no one decks the halls quite like Claire. But this year, as her grown kids and distracted husband get swept up in their own seasonal dramas, they make one crucial mistake: they forget their mom. By the time they realize she's missing, Claire’s already set off on a festive adventure of her own - one that doesn’t involve cooking, cleaning, or coordinating anyone else’s chaos. As her family scrambles to find her and salvage their Christmas, Claire rediscovers what the holidays mean when you’re finally free to put yourself first.\n\nWith a dazzling ensemble cast including Felicity Jones, Chloë Grace Moretz, Denis Leary, Dominic Sessa, Danielle Brooks, Devery Jacobs, Havana Rose Liu, Maude Apatow, with Jason Schwartzman with Eva Longoria and Joan Chen, Oh. What. Fun. is a spirited holiday comedy from director Michael Showalter and writers Chandler Baker and Showalter. A wink to every overworked holiday host, the film celebrates family, freedom, and the unexpected magic of a Christmas gone off-script.\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now? We’ve got it.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."
