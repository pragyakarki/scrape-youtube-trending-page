Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.\n\nInspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable.\n\nManor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed.\n\nSpreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.\n\nAssign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.\n\nBuild extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.\n\nGuide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.\n\nFrom boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests.\n\nResources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket?\n\nEstablish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.\n\nYours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.\n\nTrain a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory.",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling!

A lot of warranty rejections actually legally qualify as fraud. You can report it here: https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/\n\nThis undercover warranty investigation is a one-year follow-up from our series that investigated ASUS for motherboards incinerating AMD CPUs, at the end of which ASUS promised a number of improvements to its then-anti-consumer warranty processes. Spoiler alert: They're still anti-consumer. We sent our ASUS ROG Ally Z1 Extreme in for warranty repair for issues with the left joystick (\"drift\"). The device also had a broken microSD card. ASUS then pointed to the world's tiniest scratch and tried to charge us $200 for it under threat of sending back a disassembled device if we didn't pay within 5 days. It felt like extortion. If you're wondering whether ASUS is worth buying, the answer for anyone who values support should be \"no.\"\n\nWe have now tested ASUS' motherboard and ROG Ally warranty and RMA processes. Both have been anti-consumer experiences.\n\nWatch the Scumbag ASUS video that started this series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbGfc-JBxlY\nWatch our legal correspondent and attorney comment on ASUS' warranty last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJKzKbqxa0A\nWatch our series on the Newegg saga here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fnXsmXzphI&list=PLsuVSmND84QtAQc1-VjA5gT5v6ugM1gdZ\n\r\nLike our content?

                "description": "Sponsor: YOU! Viewers make these independent investigations possible. Buy a limited CyberSkeleton shirt! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/limited-edition-foil-cyberskeleton2-cotton-tshirt (uses a brilliant blue and gold foil)\nOr consider grabbing one of our heavy-duty silicone soldering & project mats: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-project-soldering-mat\nYou can also find one of our PC building Modmats with reference wiring diagrams here: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\nOr for some drinkware, get a copper-plated stainless steel mule mug with a thermal conductivity formula laser-etched in it! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-copper-plated-stainless-steel-mule-mug-thermal-conductivity-of-copper\n\nHas ASUS scammed you? A lot of warranty rejections actually legally qualify as fraud. You can report it here: https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/\n\nThis undercover warranty investigation is a one-year follow-up from our series that investigated ASUS for motherboards incinerating AMD CPUs, at the end of which ASUS promised a number of improvements to its then-anti-consumer warranty processes. Spoiler alert: They're still anti-consumer. We sent our ASUS ROG Ally Z1 Extreme in for warranty repair for issues with the left joystick (\"drift\"). The device also had a broken microSD card. ASUS then pointed to the world's tiniest scratch and tried to charge us $200 for it under threat of sending back a disassembled device if we didn't pay within 5 days. It felt like extortion. If you're wondering whether ASUS is worth buying, the answer for anyone who values support should be \"no.\"\n\nWe have now tested ASUS' motherboard and ROG Ally warranty and RMA processes. Both have been anti-consumer experiences.\n\nWatch the Scumbag ASUS video that started this series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbGfc-JBxlY\nWatch our legal correspondent and attorney comment on ASUS' warranty last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJKzKbqxa0A\nWatch our series on the Newegg saga here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fnXsmXzphI&list=PLsuVSmND84QtAQc1-VjA5gT5v6ugM1gdZ\n\r\nLike our content?

YOUNG SHELDON will sign off Thursday, May 16 with back-to-back episodes (8:00-8:30 PM, ET/PT and 8:30-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network, and streaming on Paramount+.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Young Sheldon\" Channel HERE: https://www.youtube.com/@YoungSheldonCBS \nStream Full Episodes of Young Sheldon on Paramount+: https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/young-sheldon/ \nWatch Full Episodes of \"Young Sheldon\" HERE: https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/young-sheldon/ \nLike “Young Sheldon” on Facebook HERE: https://www.facebook.com/YoungSheldonCBS/ \nFollow “Young Sheldon” on Instagram HERE: https://www.instagram.com/YoungSheldonCBS/\n\n#youngsheldon #cbs #paramountplus\n\n--\nFor young Sheldon Cooper, it isn’t easy growing up in East Texas. Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn’t always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn’t understand. Sheldon’s mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn’t fit in. Sheldon’s older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it’s tough to be cool when you’re in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there’s Sheldon’s beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on “The Big Bang Theory,” audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.",

Use code INHERITANCE to get 100 free blade refills at http://hensonshaving.com/inheritance\n\nGears and Gear Cutting Book (affiliate link) - https://amzn.to/3WtS4ep\n\nHow have I managed to avoid this core component of a machinists’ repertoire for so long?

            "description": "Pound-for-pound great Canelo Álvarez turned in a vintage performance by dropping the previously unbeaten Jaime Munguia Saturday night on his way to earning a unanimous decision as Canelo Promotions presented the all-Mexican clash headlining a PBC Pay-Per-View event on Prime Video from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nMaking the fourth defense of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO 168-pound world titles, Canelo delivered another Cinco de Mayo weekend masterpiece as he took home the decision by scores of 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112. Munguia fought valiantly and was extremely busy in the ring, but Canelo consistently landed the cleaner shots across the 12 rounds.\n \n“This win means a lot,” said Canelo. “I’m glad that I gave him this opportunity. Munguia is a great guy and a great champion. He’s gonna have a great career. I’m very proud that the whole world is watching us Mexicans.”\n \n\"I came out strong and was winning the early rounds,” said Munguia. “I let my hands go, but he’s a fighter with a lot of experience. The loss hurts because it's my first loss and I felt strong.”\n \nMunguia appeared to have the momentum after he closed round three with a right hand that appeared to snap Canelo’s head back. However, Canelo responded like the future Hall of Famer he is and delivered the highlight of the fight in round four with a left hook-uppercut that put Munguia on the mat.\n \n“I took my time,” said Canelo. “I have a lot of experience. Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong and smart. But I have 12 rounds to win the fight and I did. I did really good and I’m proud of it. He’s strong, but he’s a little slow. I could see every punch. That’s why I’m the best.”\n \n\"There’s no doubt I would have beaten anyone else tonight,” said Munguia. “He has a lot of experience. I started well, but he’s a fighter who creates a lot of problems.\"\n \nCanelo rode the momentum from that moment to dominate the final eight rounds on the way to his unanimous decision. While Munguia threw more punches than Canelo according to CompuBox (663-536), it was Canelo who held the edge in shots landed (234-170) and connect rate (44% to 26%).\n \nAfter sweeping the final three rounds on all of the cards, Canelo discussed his place in boxing history and his plans for what comes next.\n \n“When I retire, my numbers will say what position I'm in,” said Canelo. “I know there's a lot of great Mexican fighters in the past, but I’m the best fighting right now. I’m gonna rest and enjoy my family. If the money is right, I can fight right now. I’ve fought everyone and I can do what I want.\"\n\n#CaneloMunguia #Canelo #JaimeMunguia \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the Oscar® nominated writer-director of Minari, Twisters stars Daisy Edgar-Jones (Where the Crawdads Sing), Glen Powell (Top Gun: Maverick) and Anthony Ramos (Transformers: Rise of the Beasts) as equal forces, with opposing motivations, who come together to try to predict, and possibly tame, the immense power of tornadoes.\n\nEdgar-Jones stars as Kate Carter, a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her college years who now studies storm patterns on screens safely in New York City. She is lured back to the open plains by her friend, Javi (Ramos) to test a groundbreaking new tracking system. There, she crosses paths with Tyler Owens (Powell), the charming and reckless social-media superstar who thrives on posting his storm-chasing adventures with his raucous crew, the more dangerous the better.\n \nAs storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed, and Kate, Tyler, Javi and their crews find themselves squarely in the paths of multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma in the fight of their lives.\n\nTwisters features an exciting new cast, including Nope’s Brandon Perea, Golden Globe winner Maura Tierney (Beautiful Boy), Sasha Lane (American Honey), Harry Hadden-Paton (The Crown), David Corenswet (We Own This City), Daryl McCormack (Peaky Blinders), Tunde Adebimpe (Leave the World Behind), Katy O’Brian (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), Nik Dodani (Atypical), Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) and Paul Scheer (Black Monday).\n\nFrom Amblin, Twisters is directed by Lee Isaac Chung and is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall (Jurassic and Indiana Jones franchises) and by Patrick Crowley (Jurassic and Bourne franchises). The screenplay is by Mark L. Smith, writer of the Best Picture nominee The Revenant, from a story by Joseph Kosinski (Oblivion), based on characters created by Michael Crichton & Anne Marie Crichton. The executive producers are Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, Thomas Hayslip and Ashley Jay Sandberg. Twisters will be distributed by Universal Pictures domestically and by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally. \n\nFollow us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/twistersmovie\nFind us on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/twistersmovie/\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Twistersmovie\nFollow us on TikTok at https://www.tiktok.com/@twistersmovie\nhttps://www.twisters-movie.com/\n#TwistersMovie\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@twistersthealbum\nhttps://www.instagram.com/twistersthealbum/\nhttps://twitter.com/twistersalbum\nhttps://www.facebook.com/twistersthealbum\n\nTwisters: The Album available everywhere July 19.

There, she crosses paths with Tyler Owens (Powell), the charming and reckless social-media superstar who thrives on posting his storm-chasing adventures with his raucous crew, the more dangerous the better.\n \nAs storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed, and Kate, Tyler, Javi and their crews find themselves squarely in the paths of multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma in the fight of their lives.\n\nTwisters features an exciting new cast, including Nope’s Brandon Perea, Golden Globe winner Maura Tierney (Beautiful Boy), Sasha Lane (American Honey), Harry Hadden-Paton (The Crown), David Corenswet (We Own This City), Daryl McCormack (Peaky Blinders), Tunde Adebimpe (Leave the World Behind), Katy O’Brian (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), Nik Dodani (Atypical), Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) and Paul Scheer (Black Monday).\n\nFrom Amblin, Twisters is directed by Lee Isaac Chung and is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall (Jurassic and Indiana Jones franchises) and by Patrick Crowley (Jurassic and Bourne franchises). The screenplay is by Mark L. Smith, writer of the Best Picture nominee The Revenant, from a story by Joseph Kosinski (Oblivion), based on characters created by Michael Crichton & Anne Marie Crichton. The executive producers are Academy Award® winner Steven Spielberg, Thomas Hayslip and Ashley Jay Sandberg. Twisters will be distributed by Universal Pictures domestically and by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally. \n\nFollow us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/twistersmovie\nFind us on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/twistersmovie/\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Twistersmovie\nFollow us on TikTok at https://www.tiktok.com/@twistersmovie\nhttps://www.twisters-movie.com/\n#TwistersMovie\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@twistersthealbum\nhttps://www.instagram.com/twistersthealbum/\nhttps://twitter.com/twistersalbum\nhttps://www.facebook.com/twistersthealbum\n\nTwisters: The Album available everywhere July 19.

Be sure to tune in for all of the fashion fun—where one can spectate all of the A-listers as they arrive in style.\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala will celebrate the Costume Institute’s new exhibition, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” and the official dress code is “The Garden of Time.” The exhibit will feature approximately 250 rare items drawn from the Costume Institute’s permanent collection. Spanning over 400 years of fashion history, the pieces will include designs by Schiaparelli, Dior, Givenchy, and more. Some garments that are too fragile to ever be worn again—such as a Charles Frederick Worth ball gown from 1877—will also be displayed via video animation, light projection, AI, CGI, and other forms of sensory stimulation.\n\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:01:49 - Anna Wintour\n00:03:29 - Celebrities Arrive\n00:04:29 - Zendaya\n00:08:56 - Jennifer Lopez\n00:13:16 - Stray Kids & Tommy Hilfiger\n00:15:35 - Mindy Kaling\n00:18:00 - Alia Bhatt\n00:22:12 - Colman Domingo\n00:26:02 - Tyla\n00:27:32 - Taylor Russell & Greta Lee\n00:31:02 - Seth Meyers\n00:33:19 - Sam Smith & Christian Cowan\n00:36:12 - James Corden Arrives\n00:37:20 - Gigi Hadid Arrives\n00:38:00 - Rita Ora & Taika Waititi\n00:42:23 - Olivier Rousteing\n00:45:52 - Tory Burch & Uma Thurman\n00:47:25 - Eddie Redmayne\n00:50:32 - Emily Ratajkowski\n00:52:16 - Demi Moore & Harris Reed\n00:56:40 - Chris Hemsworth\n00:58:56 - Phoebe Dynevor & Charlotte Tilbury\n01:02:09 - Nicholas Galitzine\n01:04:05 - Karol G\n01:05:56 - Kris Jenner & Corey Gamble\n01:07:45 - Troye Sivan\n01:10:57 - Rosalía\n01:13:11 - Dove Cameron\n01:15:04 - Charli XCX\n01:16:44 - Tom Ford\n01:18:20 - Ariana Grande Arrives\n01:18:20 - Gabrielle Union & Dwyane Wade\n01:24:00 - Penelope Cruz\n01:27:00 - Sarah Jessica Parker & Andy Cohen\n01:28:50 - Lil Nas X Arrives\n01:29:55 - Ariana Grande\n01:32:09 - Cynthia Erivo\n01:35:43 - Gigi Hadid\n01:35:43 - Queen Latifah & Eboni Nichols\n01:41:00 - Max Hollein\n01:43:05 - Stella McCartney, FKA Twigs, Ed Sheeran, & Cara Delevigne\n01:45:58 - Kendall Jenner\n01:48:19 - Madelyn Cline\n01:50:45 - Bad Bunny\n01:52:04 - Chloe Sevigny\n01:57:29 - Dua Lipa\n01:58:08 - Nicole Kidman\n01:59:06 - Kylie Jenner\n01:59:36 - Doja Cat\n02:01:39 - Kim Kardashian & Lana Del Rey\n02:04:53 - Demi Lovato\n02:05:52 - Da’Vine Joy Randolph & Zac Posen\n02:08:50 - Ayo Edebiri\n02:10:43 - Elizabeth Debicki\n02:12:21 - Lewis Hamilton\n02:15:45 - Sienna Miller, Greta Gerwig, Emma Mackey, Chemena Kamali, and Zoe Saldana\n02:20:16 - Matt Damon\n02:21:00 - Sabrina Carpenter\n02:27:01 - Cardi B",

New trailer out now!\n--\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@minions\nFacebook:  https://uni.pictures/MinionsFB\nX: https://uni.pictures/MinionsTW\nInstagram:  https://uni.pictures/MinionsIG\nOfficial Site:  https://despicable.me\n--\nIn the first Despicable Me movie in seven years, Gru, the world’s favorite supervillain-turned-Anti-Villain League-agent, returns for an exciting, bold new era of Minions mayhem in Illumination’s Despicable Me 4. \n\nFollowing the 2022 summer blockbuster phenomenon of Illumination’s Minions: The Rise of Gru, which earned almost $1 billion worldwide, the biggest global animated franchise in history now begins a new chapter as Gru (Oscar® nominee Steve Carrell) and Lucy (Oscar® nominee Kristen Wiig) and their girls —Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Madison Polan)—welcome a new member to the Gru family, Gru Jr., who is intent on tormenting his dad.\n\nGru faces a new nemesis in Maxime Le Mal (Emmy winner Will Ferrell) and his femme fatale girlfriend Valentina (Emmy nominee Sofia Vergara), and the family is forced to go on the run.  \n\nThe film features fresh new characters voiced by Joey King (Bullet Train), Emmy winner Stephen Colbert (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert) and Chloe Fineman (Saturday Night Live). Pierre Coffin returns as the iconic voice of the Minions and Oscar® nominee Steve Coogan returns as Silas Ramsbottom. \n\nPacked with non-stop action and filled with Illumination’s signature subversive humor, Despicable Me 4 is directed by a co-creator of the Minions, Oscar® nominee Chris Renaud (Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets), and is produced by Illumination’s visionary founder and CEO Chris Meledandri and by Brett Hoffman (executive producer, The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Minions: The Rise of Gru). The film is co-directed by Patrick Delage (animation director Sing 2 and The Secret Life of Pets 2), and the screenplay is by the Emmy winning creator of White Lotus, Mike White, and the veteran writer of every Despicable Me film, Ken Daurio.",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #afterhours",
