            "title": "Structures Burn as Palisades Fire Explodes to 1,200+ Acres",
            "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

                "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

Gallo (“The Irishman”), Wallace Langham (“Ford v Ferrari”), Louis Mustillo (“Cooper’s Bar,” “Mike & Molly”), Frank Piccirillo, Matt Servitto (“Billions”) and Robert Uricola (“Raging Bull”).\n\nJoining Levinson (“Rainman,” “Dopesick”) behind the camera are Oscar-nominated director of photography Dante Spinotti (“The Insider,” “L.A. Confidential”), production designer Neil Spisak (the “Spider-Man” films, “Dopesick”), Oscar-nominated editor Douglas Crise (“Babel,” “Dopesick”), Oscar-nominated costume designer Jeffrey Kurland (“Bullets Over Broadway,” “Tenet”), award-winning casting director Ellen Chenoweth (“Past Lives”) and composer David Fleming (“Hillbilly Elegy,” “Mr. & Mrs. Smith”).\n\nWarner Bros.

More than 10,000 homes and other buildings have been destroyed with entire neighbourhoods reduced to ashes. \n\n180,000 people have been told to leave their homes with hundreds of thousands more on high alert.\n\nArson investigators are looking into the cause of one of the major fires, in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angleles.   Five people are known to have died and the authorities say if fires were started deliberately deaths will be treated as murder.   There are some reports of looting with more than 20 arrests.\n\nFire authorities are admitting they do not have enough resources to tackle the biggest wildfires ever seen in the Los Angeles area.

            "description": "We thought this would be a breeze – replacing seals in a 10-tonne forklift steering cylinder. WRONG! ☠️ Upon disassembly, we discovered a terrible sight: major DAMAGE on the piston and inside the barrel! 😱 This wasn't a simple seal job anymore – it is a full-blown rebuild! In Part 1, we dive deep into the damage, stripping the cylinder bare and removing all the seals. We then prepare for a new barrel by machining off the old mounts. We also tackle the task of repairing the damaged piston on the cylinder rod. We carefully machine it down, weld on silicon bronze, and then machine it back to spec. Don't miss Part 2 where we complete the rebuild with more machining, welding, drilling and honing!
