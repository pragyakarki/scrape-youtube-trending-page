            "description": "A lion who would change our lives forever. #Mufasa: The Lion King, in theaters December 20.\n\n“Mufasa: The Lion King” enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny—their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.  \n \nNew and returning cast members were called on to lend their voices to the film:\n- Aaron Pierre as Mufasa\n- Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Taka, a lion prince with a bright future who accepts Mufasa into his family as a brother\n- Tiffany Boone as Sarabi\n- Kagiso Lediga as Young Rafiki\n- Preston Nyman as Zazu\n- Mads Mikkelsen as Kiros, a formidable lion with big plans for his pride \n- Thandiwe Newton as Taka’s mother, Eshe\n- Lennie James as Taka’s father, Obasi \n- Anika Noni Rose as Mufasa’s mother, Afia\n- Keith David as Mufasa’s father, Masego\n- John Kani as Rafiki\n- Seth Rogen as Pumbaa\n- Billy Eichner as Timon\n- Donald Glover as Simba\n- Introducing Blue Ivy Carter as Kiara, daughter of King Simba and Queen Nala\n- And Beyoncé Knowles-Carter as Nala\n \nAdditional casting includes Braelyn Rankins, Theo Somolu, Folake Olowofoyeku, Joanna Jones, Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, Abdul Salis and Dominique Jennings.\n\n“Mufasa: The Lion King,” the new film coming to theaters Dec. 20 explores the unlikely rise of the beloved king of the Pride Lands. The film has an all-star roster of talent bringing new and fan-favorite characters to life—plus, celebrated award-winning songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda is writing the film’s songs produced by Mark Mancina and Miranda, with additional music and performances by Lebo M. \n \nSaid Miranda, “Elton John. Tim Rice. Hans Zimmer. Lebo M. Mark Mancina. Beyoncé, Labrinth, Ilya Salmanzadeh. Beau Black, Ford Riley, the incredible music team on ‘The Lion Guard,’ and so many musical contributors over the years. ‘The Lion King’ has an incredible musical legacy with music from some of the greatest songwriters around, and I'm humbled and proud to be a part of it. It's been a joy working alongside Barry Jenkins to bring Mufasa's story to life, and we can't wait for audiences to experience this film in theaters.\"\n \nBlending live-action filmmaking techniques with photoreal computer-generated imagery, “Mufasa: The Lion King” is directed by Barry Jenkins, produced by Adele Romanski & Mark Ceryak, and executive produced by Peter Tobyansen.",

Use primitive tools, hydro-powered machines, and player-built structures to dig and evolve your operation in this tycoon-style progression system.\n\nDig Deep!\nUsing a state-of-the-art voxel based terrain system, you can create cave networks, quarry pits, or even mud mountains. Discover relics of the past in the depths of Hydroneer, with better rewards the deeper you dig.\n\nForge, Build, and Create!\nHydroneer features a dynamic modular system for building structures and hydro powered machinery. Create the base of operations from your own design to optimise your work. Create networks of hydro pipes, control pressure. Craft resources, weaponry, jewellery, grow vegetables, and cook soup for villagers.\n\nHydro Powered Vehicles\nLarge hydro powered machines used for a variety of uses, from digging resources and finding ore veins, to transporting goods.\n\nExplore the World of Hydroneer\nVarious parcels of land await you in the world of Hydroneer, each with their own advantages. Deeper pits, attractive scenery, and closer stores. You decide where to build your base of operations.\n\nABOUT THE DLC:\nSail across the sea to Volcalidus, where a new adventure awaits. This expansion delivers new mechanics to the game to aid you in your mining expedition - from huge new vehicles, to interesting new progression systems.\n\nHarness the power of the volcano with new lava-powered machinery.\nExplore Volcalidus, over 6 times the size of the original island!\nHelp rebuild the capital town of New Glade, open new stores to browse.\nDiscover new resources deep underground.\nAugment your tools and machinery while crafting them with buffs.\nOperate new vehicles, including the huge Hydro-Hauler crane truck.\nAnd more!\n\nJourney to Volcalidus takes place in a completely new location, accessible via ship from Bridgepour Harbour.

Use primitive tools, hydro-powered machines, and player-built structures to dig and evolve your operation in this tycoon-style progression system.\n\nDig Deep!\nUsing a state-of-the-art voxel based terrain system, you can create cave networks, quarry pits, or even mud mountains. Discover relics of the past in the depths of Hydroneer, with better rewards the deeper you dig.\n\nForge, Build, and Create!\nHydroneer features a dynamic modular system for building structures and hydro powered machinery. Create the base of operations from your own design to optimise your work. Create networks of hydro pipes, control pressure. Craft resources, weaponry, jewellery, grow vegetables, and cook soup for villagers.\n\nHydro Powered Vehicles\nLarge hydro powered machines used for a variety of uses, from digging resources and finding ore veins, to transporting goods.\n\nExplore the World of Hydroneer\nVarious parcels of land await you in the world of Hydroneer, each with their own advantages. Deeper pits, attractive scenery, and closer stores. You decide where to build your base of operations.\n\nABOUT THE DLC:\nSail across the sea to Volcalidus, where a new adventure awaits. This expansion delivers new mechanics to the game to aid you in your mining expedition - from huge new vehicles, to interesting new progression systems.\n\nHarness the power of the volcano with new lava-powered machinery.\nExplore Volcalidus, over 6 times the size of the original island!\nHelp rebuild the capital town of New Glade, open new stores to browse.\nDiscover new resources deep underground.\nAugment your tools and machinery while crafting them with buffs.\nOperate new vehicles, including the huge Hydro-Hauler crane truck.\nAnd more!\n\nJourney to Volcalidus takes place in a completely new location, accessible via ship from Bridgepour Harbour. Due to the distinctive new features and mechanics of this expansion, items and vehicles cannot be taken to Volcalidus."

            "description": "Fox Sports’ lead college football analyst Joel Klatt is back after covering the NFL Draft from Detroit and starts the show by discussing the most surprising pick: the Falcons taking Michael Penix Jr with the 8th pick.  He breaks down why Atlanta’s decision-making this offseason has put both Kirk Cousins and Michael Penix Jr in a bad spot. Klatt also discusses the Giants’ decision to pass on J.J. McCarthy and the Vikings ultimately landing the Michigan QB. The Bears landed two elite talents in the Top 10 in Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze and look poised for a potential playoff run next season. The Broncos have received criticism for where they drafted Bo Nix but Klatt explains why they made the right choice. Finally, Joel discusses why the Cowboys could regret not drafting a Running Back and why Washington had a great draft selecting Illinois DT Jer’Zhan Newton and Michigan DB Mike Sainristil along with the 2nd overall pick in the Draft, LSU QB Jayden Daniels.\n\nChapters 📚\n0:00-1:42 Intro\n1:43-4:19 NFL Draft story and 2024 draft anamoly \n4:20-13:11 Falcons select Michael Penix Jr. with 8th pick\n13:12-19:22 Vikings selects J.J.

                "description": "Fox Sports’ lead college football analyst Joel Klatt is back after covering the NFL Draft from Detroit and starts the show by discussing the most surprising pick: the Falcons taking Michael Penix Jr with the 8th pick.  He breaks down why Atlanta’s decision-making this offseason has put both Kirk Cousins and Michael Penix Jr in a bad spot. Klatt also discusses the Giants’ decision to pass on J.J. McCarthy and the Vikings ultimately landing the Michigan QB. The Bears landed two elite talents in the Top 10 in Caleb Williams and Rome Odunze and look poised for a potential playoff run next season. The Broncos have received criticism for where they drafted Bo Nix but Klatt explains why they made the right choice. Finally, Joel discusses why the Cowboys could regret not drafting a Running Back and why Washington had a great draft selecting Illinois DT Jer’Zhan Newton and Michigan DB Mike Sainristil along with the 2nd overall pick in the Draft, LSU QB Jayden Daniels.\n\nChapters 📚\n0:00-1:42 Intro\n1:43-4:19 NFL Draft story and 2024 draft anamoly \n4:20-13:11 Falcons select Michael Penix Jr. with 8th pick\n13:12-19:22 Vikings selects J.J.

            "description": "The 2024 NFL Draft is officially over & the Dallas Cowboys added 8 players in the NFL Draft, although none of them are a running back! Cowboys Report host Tom Downey breaks down each of the Cowboys draft picks and gives you his final draft grade for the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys drafted OT Tyler Guyton from Oklahoma in Round 1 before taking DE Marshawn Kneeland, Center Cooper Beebe and LB Marist Liuafu in Round 3.

His key strengths include a high football IQ and good hand placement. However, his athletic limitations may affect his effectiveness against faster pass rushers​​.\n\nMarshawn Kneeland Draft Profile:\nMarshawn Kneeland from Western Michigan recorded 6 sacks, using his size and strength to power through opponents.

            "description": "In a north London derby day to remember, we beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 to remain on top of the Premier League with three games to play.\n\nA sensational opening 45 minutes provided the platform for the points, as we led by three going into the interval. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s own goal set us on our way before Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz added their names to the scoresheet.\n\nHowever Spurs mounted a comeback and Cristian Romero pulled one back before a penalty from Heung-min Son five minutes from time made it a grandstand finish, but it couldn’t prevent us from recording back-to-back wins at the home of our biggest rivals for the first time since 1988, as well as hand Mikel Arteta his 100th Premier League win as our manager.\n\nMuch was made pre-match of Spurs having 15 days to prepare while we had played four games in that period, but any concerns about fatigue were blown apart in a devastating opening half that blew our neighbours away.\n\nThe ball was first in the back of the Spurs net 13 minutes in when a beautiful pass by Thomas Partey released Martin Odegaard who teed up Havertz to power a shot past Gugliemo Vicario but our skipper was flagged offside in the build-up, however just two minutes later the net rippled again - and it did count.\n\nAfter Declan Rice saw a shot blocked for a corner, Saka sent a teasing delivery towards the near post which tempted Hojbjerg just enough to flick it on, and it ended up past his own goalkeeper to reward our early positivity.\n\nJust like last season, a helping hand from Spurs had put us in the ascendency, and Ange Postecoglou’s team quickly tried to respond. Firstly, Romero got his head on the end of a James Maddison corner and struck the outside of the post, and then on 24 minutes VAR came to our rescue.\n\nAnother set-piece was cleared out to Pedro Porro who struck a hopeful low blast goalwards, and it fell kindly into the path of Micky van de Ven to tuck past David Raya, but the video officials got the lines out and found the Dutch defender to be marginally offside.\n\nThat proved to be a huge turning point, and within three minutes what could have been 1-1 was suddenly 2-0 to the visitors. After some penalty appeals from Tottenham were waved away by Michael Oliver, we pounced to spring a counter attack to devastating effect.\n\nSaka found Havertz, and the German waited before pinging a delightful pass back over the charging winger, who showed great composure to beat Ben Davies and fire past Vicario, becoming the first Englishman to score 15 league goals for us in a campaign since Ian Wright in 1997.\n\nThat sent Gooners packed into the away end into dreamland, and it got even better on 38 minutes when Rice swung a corner into the area, and Havertz took advantage of some static defending to nod the ball past Vicario to score his third goal in five days, and put us in a commanding position at the break.\n\nThe second half began with us looking likely to really make a statement, and Takehiro Tomiyasu nearly added a fourth when he headed just over before Romero did the same at the other end. Then having already reached a seasonal high for Premier League goals, Saka had a glorious chance to add to that tally when Havertz clipped a ball to the back post, but Vicario kicked away his volley.\n\nHowever on 64 minutes we allowed Spurs to claw one back. William Saliba played the ball back to Raya who misjudged his pass and saw it fall straight into Romero’s path, who slotted home to end our club-record longest run without conceding on the road at six matches.\n\nThat got the home fans excited that their team could try and attempt a comeback, and while we initially weathered the storm well, with five minutes VAR evened the score when they adjudged Rice to have kicked Davies inside the area, allowing Son the chance to step up to fire the ball past Raya from 12 yards and ensure a nervy ending for Arteta’s side.\n\nPostecoglou’s team threw everything at us in the final five minutes and another six of additional time, but we saw out the barrage of crosses into our area and prevented a shot at goal to ensure our dreams of winning a first Premier League crown in 20 years are maintained.\n\n#arsenal",

After some penalty appeals from Tottenham were waved away by Michael Oliver, we pounced to spring a counter attack to devastating effect.\n\nSaka found Havertz, and the German waited before pinging a delightful pass back over the charging winger, who showed great composure to beat Ben Davies and fire past Vicario, becoming the first Englishman to score 15 league goals for us in a campaign since Ian Wright in 1997.\n\nThat sent Gooners packed into the away end into dreamland, and it got even better on 38 minutes when Rice swung a corner into the area, and Havertz took advantage of some static defending to nod the ball past Vicario to score his third goal in five days, and put us in a commanding position at the break.\n\nThe second half began with us looking likely to really make a statement, and Takehiro Tomiyasu nearly added a fourth when he headed just over before Romero did the same at the other end. Then having already reached a seasonal high for Premier League goals, Saka had a glorious chance to add to that tally when Havertz clipped a ball to the back post, but Vicario kicked away his volley.\n\nHowever on 64 minutes we allowed Spurs to claw one back. William Saliba played the ball back to Raya who misjudged his pass and saw it fall straight into Romero’s path, who slotted home to end our club-record longest run without conceding on the road at six matches.\n\nThat got the home fans excited that their team could try and attempt a comeback, and while we initially weathered the storm well, with five minutes VAR evened the score when they adjudged Rice to have kicked Davies inside the area, allowing Son the chance to step up to fire the ball past Raya from 12 yards and ensure a nervy ending for Arteta’s side.\n\nPostecoglou’s team threw everything at us in the final five minutes and another six of additional time, but we saw out the barrage of crosses into our area and prevented a shot at goal to ensure our dreams of winning a first Premier League crown in 20 years are maintained.\n\n#arsenal"

Ne-Yo's setlist stoked up audible gasps with nonstop hits from his catalog and a few he's written for megastars. He came draped in a bedazzled outfit and his signature fedora (one we had to ask him to adjust to see his eyes.) Not to be outdone, the band came outfitted in matching earth tones and sounded just as good as they looked.\n\nAs with most artists who've spent years on the radio, the charts and in the club, the challenge in our space is encapsulating those moments. He accepted this challenge by putting together a medley of some of his most celebrated jams, showing off just how prolific his pen is. \"I've written a couple songs since I've been doing this thang,\" the singer said before passing Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" to background singer, Pamela Westbrook. Before the premiere of his \"confessional,\" the song \"Two Million Secrets,\" the singer reminded us that he also wrote Beyoncé's \"Irreplaceable\" and co-wrote Mario's \"Let Me Love You.\" He shared with us that there was a healthy dose of nerves during his set, but — forever the showman — Ne-Yo gave the ladies what they came for closing with \"Miss Independent.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Because Of You\"\n\"So Sick\"\n\"Sexy Love\"\n\"Take a Bow\"\n\"Let Me Love You\"\n\"Irreplaceable\"\n\"Two Million Secrets\"\n\"Miss Independent\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNe-Yo: lead vocals\nJustin Raines: bass guitar, key bass\nRay Ray Holloman: guitar\nMonty Reynolds: keys\nMadison Calley: harp\nLeonard \"Pudge\" Tribbett: drums\nPamela Westbrook: vocals\nCourtney Campbell: vocals\nBrian Deshawn Kelly: vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Ted Mebane\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Team: Kara Frame, Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #neyo",
