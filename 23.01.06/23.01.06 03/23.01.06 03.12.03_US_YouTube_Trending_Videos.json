Renfield is forced to procure his master’s prey and do his every bidding, no matter how debased. But now, after centuries of servitude, Renfield is ready to see if there’s a life outside the shadow of The Prince of Darkness.  If only he can figure out how to end his codependency. \n \nRenfield is directed by Chris McKay (The Tomorrow War, The LEGO Batman Movie) from a screenplay by Ryan Ridley (Ghosted series, Rick & Morty series), based on an original idea by The Walking Dead and Invincible creator Robert Kirkman. \n \nThe film co-stars Awkwafina (The Farewell, Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings), Ben Schwartz (Sonic, The Afterparty) and Adrian Martinez (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Focus). \n \nRenfield is produced by Skybound Entertainment partners Robert Kirkman and David Alpert (The Walking Dead, Invincible), co-presidents Bryan Furst (Daybreakers) and Sean Furst (Daybreakers) and by Chris McKay.

She is best known for being one of the recurring cast members on the improv comedy show Wild ‘N Out over the past ten seasons on MTV and VH1.\n\nIn this interview Marco starts off by asking if everyone knows who they are? B. Simone is joined by Megan Brooks, her co-host from “The Know For Sure Podcast.” Marco asks the ladies what do they want to get out but the ladies can’t get over Marco’s outfit. The ladies talk about their podcast. Marco asks the ladies to describe themselves. The ladies go into how long they have been friends since childhood. Marco continues the interview with random questions and the ladies entertain the questions all while sipping from red cups. Marco brings up outrageous scenarios and the ladies oblige. Marco continues to ask the ladies random questions including why B. Simone used a tv show to find love. Marco and Producer Matt pose a question and Producer Matt has an emotional moment. Marco and the ladies discuss the awkward moment. B. Simone talks about their love of Deion Sanders. Marco continues to ask random questions and the ladies defer to their podcast. The girls start to talk and the audience erupt into spontaneous thunderous applause at every comment. The interview ends with Marco asking for a date based on comments. \n\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries                                                                                        \n\nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n\nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @mattablespromotions\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n\nIG @Breakbeatmedia @FunnyMarco\n\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube page, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com",

She is best known for being one of the recurring cast members on the improv comedy show Wild ‘N Out over the past ten seasons on MTV and VH1.\n\nIn this interview Marco starts off by asking if everyone knows who they are? B. Simone is joined by Megan Brooks, her co-host from “The Know For Sure Podcast.” Marco asks the ladies what do they want to get out but the ladies can’t get over Marco’s outfit. The ladies talk about their podcast. Marco asks the ladies to describe themselves. The ladies go into how long they have been friends since childhood. Marco continues the interview with random questions and the ladies entertain the questions all while sipping from red cups. Marco brings up outrageous scenarios and the ladies oblige. Marco continues to ask the ladies random questions including why B. Simone used a tv show to find love. Marco and Producer Matt pose a question and Producer Matt has an emotional moment. Marco and the ladies discuss the awkward moment. B. Simone talks about their love of Deion Sanders. Marco continues to ask random questions and the ladies defer to their podcast. The girls start to talk and the audience erupt into spontaneous thunderous applause at every comment. The interview ends with Marco asking for a date based on comments. \n\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries                                                                                        \n\nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n\nDirector: Matt Ables  IG @mattablespromotions\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n\nIG @Breakbeatmedia @FunnyMarco\n\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube page, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com"

Run Minecraft at a good enough level to record videos\n2. Handle colour graded cinema camera files, and edit with them no dropped frames.\n3. Have a large number of high speed I/O ports to deal with multiple large data transfers at once. \n4. Be silent for recording audio in potentially small places (This is what ruled out most gaming laptops!)\n5.

Lightning McQueen was the coolest! Becuase I have a history of building the craziest and best things on YouTube and I recently transformed my old 15 year old car into Lightning McQueen, I thought it woube be awesome to also build Mater and Guido as well! To take things to the next level I surprised my good friend who is obsessed with the movie Cars with them and he was estatic! The Beem Team did amazing work once again and I’m so happy with how it turned out. This was super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. Thank you for watching! I really appreciate your support! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one!\nComment ‘’KAAAA-CHOW!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot the Best of Lightning McQueen, But Lightning McQueen's Big Crash, But Disney Cars Lightning McQueen in Real Life on Road, But Pixar Play Parade HD 1080p, But Lightning Mcqueen Real Life, But Lightning McQueen Wrap, But Cars on the Road - Cast - TRUCKS, But Movie Cars Made in Real Life, But I Turned My Car Into Lightning McQueen, But Comparison: Cars Characters in Real Life, or any other video like GROM TV, Forceman Cars, Ben Hodge, DisneyMusicVEVO, KinoCheck Family, Pixar, BE AMAZED, Disney, Unspeakable, JStu, Ben Azelart, Stephen Sharer,  Stokes Twins, or Airrack would make.

Lightning McQueen was the coolest! Becuase I have a history of building the craziest and best things on YouTube and I recently transformed my old 15 year old car into Lightning McQueen, I thought it woube be awesome to also build Mater and Guido as well! To take things to the next level I surprised my good friend who is obsessed with the movie Cars with them and he was estatic! The Beem Team did amazing work once again and I’m so happy with how it turned out. This was super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. Thank you for watching! I really appreciate your support! I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next.\n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one!\nComment ‘’KAAAA-CHOW!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot the Best of Lightning McQueen, But Lightning McQueen's Big Crash, But Disney Cars Lightning McQueen in Real Life on Road, But Pixar Play Parade HD 1080p, But Lightning Mcqueen Real Life, But Lightning McQueen Wrap, But Cars on the Road - Cast - TRUCKS, But Movie Cars Made in Real Life, But I Turned My Car Into Lightning McQueen, But Comparison: Cars Characters in Real Life, or any other video like GROM TV, Forceman Cars, Ben Hodge, DisneyMusicVEVO, KinoCheck Family, Pixar, BE AMAZED, Disney, Unspeakable, JStu, Ben Azelart, Stephen Sharer,  Stokes Twins, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10 not Matthew Beam) builds real life Lightning McQueen, Mater, and Guido from the Disney Pixar movie Cars!"

There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”).

                "description": "If you ask me, there’s almost nothing on this blue earth more fascinating than water infrastructure.\n🪒 Get a precision razor from Henson with code PRACTICALENGINEERING for a free pack of 100 blades: https://bit.ly/3CWiWJP\n\nWatch on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-how-different-spillway-gates-work\n\nAlmost all dams need a way to release excess water when the reservoir is full. Although many dams use uncontrolled spillways, gated spillways provide more control over the flow, allowing us to build smaller, more cost-effective structures. There are countless arrangements of mechanical devices that have been used across the world and throughout history to manage the flow of water. But, modern engineering has coalesced to variations on only a few different kinds of gates.\n\nWant a book or a t-shirt? https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

            "description": "e-Bay listing for Nukie: https://www.ebay.com/itm/225324479952\n\nThere's been a growing trend in VHS collecting, which has created an entirely new market for professional VHS grading, very similar to what's been happening with video game cartridge grading. As the owner's of 1000s of crappy VHS tapes, we were curious to dig deeper into this trend, as well as examine what makes something valuable and collectible. This all culminated in us taking a deeper look into our collection of Nukie tapes. Everything always leads to Nukie.\n\nSt. Jude's Children's Research Hospital: https://www.stjude.org/ \nWisconsin Humane Society: https://www.wihumane.org/",

As the owner's of 1000s of crappy VHS tapes, we were curious to dig deeper into this trend, as well as examine what makes something valuable and collectible. This all culminated in us taking a deeper look into our collection of Nukie tapes. Everything always leads to Nukie.\n\nSt. Jude's Children's Research Hospital: https://www.stjude.org/ \nWisconsin Humane Society: https://www.wihumane.org/"
