            "description": "Big Big Day!! As the guys said, the end of our MixTape Era now the album drops....To kick off our new partnership with Fanatics, hosts Ryan Clark, Fred Taylor, and Channing Crowder sit down with none other than the 7x Super Bowl champion and NFL icon, Tom Brady. While the world has seen glimpses of Tom's personality, most recently on Netflix's \"Greatest Roast of All Time\", The Pivot Podcast dives deep into who Tom really is off the football field and beyond the headlines and storylines.\n\nReflecting on last week and his takeaways from doing the roast with former New England teammates and coaches, Kevin Hart and other celebrity comedians, Tom is learning to let go of the control he used to have as Quarterback and learning to live in the grey area of life, learning but improving on the decisions he makes each day. Having some regrets by not looking at the full picture of the roast, he is focused on being the best parent he can to his 3 kids always. Fanatics and The Pivot gift TB with a special memorabilia from the 1981 NFC Championship that brings him back to the innocence of his childhood when his reality was just a dream but a dream ignited by passion for football and love for competition leading him to be one of the greatest to ever step on the field.\n\nAfter commanding the field for 22 years, Tom became a master of the sport, but our conversation reveals how he continues to evolve as a man, friend, and father away from the game. He discusses the importance of personal growth and reflects on the lessons learned throughout his illustrious career with a strong focus on the quality time with his kids and being there for them in anyway possible.\n\nOpening up about the profound influence his parents had on him, instilling his drive and motivation to succeed from a young age. From his humble beginnings to his meteoric rise in the NFL, Tom shares the difference makers in his life that kept him focused and determined throughout his career.\n\nTo celebrate Fanatics Sportsbook going live in its 20th state, starting from 14th May for 20 days, they are offering over $5m in customer bonuses as well as a number of extra special surprises along the way.

While the world has seen glimpses of Tom's personality, most recently on Netflix's \"Greatest Roast of All Time\", The Pivot Podcast dives deep into who Tom really is off the football field and beyond the headlines and storylines.\n\nReflecting on last week and his takeaways from doing the roast with former New England teammates and coaches, Kevin Hart and other celebrity comedians, Tom is learning to let go of the control he used to have as Quarterback and learning to live in the grey area of life, learning but improving on the decisions he makes each day. Having some regrets by not looking at the full picture of the roast, he is focused on being the best parent he can to his 3 kids always. Fanatics and The Pivot gift TB with a special memorabilia from the 1981 NFC Championship that brings him back to the innocence of his childhood when his reality was just a dream but a dream ignited by passion for football and love for competition leading him to be one of the greatest to ever step on the field.\n\nAfter commanding the field for 22 years, Tom became a master of the sport, but our conversation reveals how he continues to evolve as a man, friend, and father away from the game. He discusses the importance of personal growth and reflects on the lessons learned throughout his illustrious career with a strong focus on the quality time with his kids and being there for them in anyway possible.\n\nOpening up about the profound influence his parents had on him, instilling his drive and motivation to succeed from a young age. From his humble beginnings to his meteoric rise in the NFL, Tom shares the difference makers in his life that kept him focused and determined throughout his career.\n\nTo celebrate Fanatics Sportsbook going live in its 20th state, starting from 14th May for 20 days, they are offering over $5m in customer bonuses as well as a number of extra special surprises along the way.

Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West. \n \nThe film also stars Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n \nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots), and a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman). \n \nDirected by acclaimed filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 26, 2025.\n \nWicked is produced by Marc Platt (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar® nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are David Nicksay, Stephen Schwartz and Jared LeBoff. \n \nBased on the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked is adapted for the screen by the stage production’s book writer Winnie Holzman and by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The Broadway stage musical is produced by Universal Stage Productions, Marc Platt, the Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone.",

Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.\n\nInspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable.\n\nManor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed.\n\nSpreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.\n\nAssign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.\n\nBuild extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.\n\nGuide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.\n\nFrom boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests.\n\nResources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket?\n\nEstablish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.\n\nYours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.\n\nTrain a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory.",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 Oman road trip\n03:13 Full Unimog Tour\n10:54 Inside tour of the Unimog\n19:50 Putting it to the test\n25:24 our beach campsite\n27:06 Bioluminescence! \n28:07 Bloops",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 Oman road trip\n03:13 Full Unimog Tour\n10:54 Inside tour of the Unimog\n19:50 Putting it to the test\n25:24 our beach campsite\n27:06 Bioluminescence! \n28:07 Bloops"

Spoiler alert: They're still anti-consumer. We sent our ASUS ROG Ally Z1 Extreme in for warranty repair for issues with the left joystick (\"drift\"). The device also had a broken microSD card. ASUS then pointed to the world's tiniest scratch and tried to charge us $200 for it under threat of sending back a disassembled device if we didn't pay within 5 days. It felt like extortion. If you're wondering whether ASUS is worth buying, the answer for anyone who values support should be \"no.\"\n\nWe have now tested ASUS' motherboard and ROG Ally warranty and RMA processes.

            "description": "Pound-for-pound great Canelo Álvarez turned in a vintage performance by dropping the previously unbeaten Jaime Munguia Saturday night on his way to earning a unanimous decision as Canelo Promotions presented the all-Mexican clash headlining a PBC Pay-Per-View event on Prime Video from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nMaking the fourth defense of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO 168-pound world titles, Canelo delivered another Cinco de Mayo weekend masterpiece as he took home the decision by scores of 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112. Munguia fought valiantly and was extremely busy in the ring, but Canelo consistently landed the cleaner shots across the 12 rounds.\n \n“This win means a lot,” said Canelo. “I’m glad that I gave him this opportunity. Munguia is a great guy and a great champion. He’s gonna have a great career. I’m very proud that the whole world is watching us Mexicans.”\n \n\"I came out strong and was winning the early rounds,” said Munguia. “I let my hands go, but he’s a fighter with a lot of experience. The loss hurts because it's my first loss and I felt strong.”\n \nMunguia appeared to have the momentum after he closed round three with a right hand that appeared to snap Canelo’s head back. However, Canelo responded like the future Hall of Famer he is and delivered the highlight of the fight in round four with a left hook-uppercut that put Munguia on the mat.\n \n“I took my time,” said Canelo. “I have a lot of experience. Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong and smart. But I have 12 rounds to win the fight and I did. I did really good and I’m proud of it. He’s strong, but he’s a little slow. I could see every punch. That’s why I’m the best.”\n \n\"There’s no doubt I would have beaten anyone else tonight,” said Munguia. “He has a lot of experience. I started well, but he’s a fighter who creates a lot of problems.\"\n \nCanelo rode the momentum from that moment to dominate the final eight rounds on the way to his unanimous decision. While Munguia threw more punches than Canelo according to CompuBox (663-536), it was Canelo who held the edge in shots landed (234-170) and connect rate (44% to 26%).\n \nAfter sweeping the final three rounds on all of the cards, Canelo discussed his place in boxing history and his plans for what comes next.\n \n“When I retire, my numbers will say what position I'm in,” said Canelo. “I know there's a lot of great Mexican fighters in the past, but I’m the best fighting right now. I’m gonna rest and enjoy my family. If the money is right, I can fight right now. I’ve fought everyone and I can do what I want.\"\n\n#CaneloMunguia #Canelo #JaimeMunguia \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

            "description": "he stars of television’s #1 comedy reflect on the series’ seven-year run in this behind-the-scenes look at the YOUNG SHELDON series finale, with Jim Parsons and Mayim Bialik reprising their roles as Sheldon Cooper and Amy Farrah Fowler. YOUNG SHELDON will sign off Thursday, May 16 with back-to-back episodes (8:00-8:30 PM, ET/PT and 8:30-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network, and streaming on Paramount+.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Young Sheldon\" Channel HERE: https://www.youtube.com/@YoungSheldonCBS \nStream Full Episodes of Young Sheldon on Paramount+: https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/young-sheldon/ \nWatch Full Episodes of \"Young Sheldon\" HERE: https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/young-sheldon/ \nLike “Young Sheldon” on Facebook HERE: https://www.facebook.com/YoungSheldonCBS/ \nFollow “Young Sheldon” on Instagram HERE: https://www.instagram.com/YoungSheldonCBS/\n\n#youngsheldon #cbs #paramountplus\n\n--\nFor young Sheldon Cooper, it isn’t easy growing up in East Texas. Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn’t always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn’t understand. Sheldon’s mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn’t fit in. Sheldon’s older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it’s tough to be cool when you’re in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there’s Sheldon’s beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on “The Big Bang Theory,” audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.",

                "title": "Young Sheldon Series Finale Preview",
                "description": "he stars of television’s #1 comedy reflect on the series’ seven-year run in this behind-the-scenes look at the YOUNG SHELDON series finale, with Jim Parsons and Mayim Bialik reprising their roles as Sheldon Cooper and Amy Farrah Fowler. YOUNG SHELDON will sign off Thursday, May 16 with back-to-back episodes (8:00-8:30 PM, ET/PT and 8:30-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network, and streaming on Paramount+.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Young Sheldon\" Channel HERE: https://www.youtube.com/@YoungSheldonCBS \nStream Full Episodes of Young Sheldon on Paramount+: https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/young-sheldon/ \nWatch Full Episodes of \"Young Sheldon\" HERE: https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/young-sheldon/ \nLike “Young Sheldon” on Facebook HERE: https://www.facebook.com/YoungSheldonCBS/ \nFollow “Young Sheldon” on Instagram HERE: https://www.instagram.com/YoungSheldonCBS/\n\n#youngsheldon #cbs #paramountplus\n\n--\nFor young Sheldon Cooper, it isn’t easy growing up in East Texas. Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn’t always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn’t understand. Sheldon’s mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn’t fit in. Sheldon’s older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it’s tough to be cool when you’re in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there’s Sheldon’s beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on “The Big Bang Theory,” audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward and hopeful journey toward the man he will become."

                "description": "The first solar storm in this train has hit! The storm is quite fast so the initial impact caused a momentary G4-level response. \n00:00:00 | Introduction\n00:00:19 | Solar Events Synopsis\n00:04:59 | 8th Earth-Directed Solar Storm Launch (just today)\n00:05:08 | Close up and Personal with Region 3664 and 3668\n00:06:47 | Radio Blackout Threat Meter\n00:08:46 | The Solar Storm Train and Prediction Models\n00:13:19 | Moon Phase\n00:13:36 | Solar Storm and Aurora 5-day Outlooks\n00:16:04 | Solar Flare and Dayside Radio Blackout 5-Day Outlook\n00:17:19 | Radiation Storm and Polar Aviation 5-Day Outlook\n00:18:29 | Summary\nRight now we are sitting at G3+ levels due to a strong, but wildly fluctuating magnetic field. This is expected while we travel through the \"turbulent\" outer envelope of this fast-moving storm. Aurora views will likely grace the skies tonight through the weekend as this series of storms hit back-to-back. Learn the details of how this solar storm train came about, learn where and when aurora will be visible, discover how these storms are impacting communications and navigation around the globe, and find out how they might impact you.\n\nThis Space Weather News forecast sponsored in part by Millersville University:\nhttps://www.millersville.edu/swen\n\nWant early access to these forecasts, tutorials on Space Weather, & more?

Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the Oscar® nominated writer-director of Minari, Twisters stars Daisy Edgar-Jones (Where the Crawdads Sing), Glen Powell (Top Gun: Maverick) and Anthony Ramos (Transformers: Rise of the Beasts) as equal forces, with opposing motivations, who come together to try to predict, and possibly tame, the immense power of tornadoes.\n\nEdgar-Jones stars as Kate Carter, a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her college years who now studies storm patterns on screens safely in New York City. She is lured back to the open plains by her friend, Javi (Ramos) to test a groundbreaking new tracking system. There, she crosses paths with Tyler Owens (Powell), the charming and reckless social-media superstar who thrives on posting his storm-chasing adventures with his raucous crew, the more dangerous the better.\n \nAs storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed, and Kate, Tyler, Javi and their crews find themselves squarely in the paths of multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma in the fight of their lives.\n\nTwisters features an exciting new cast, including Nope’s Brandon Perea, Golden Globe winner Maura Tierney (Beautiful Boy), Sasha Lane (American Honey), Harry Hadden-Paton (The Crown), David Corenswet (We Own This City), Daryl McCormack (Peaky Blinders), Tunde Adebimpe (Leave the World Behind), Katy O’Brian (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), Nik Dodani (Atypical), Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) and Paul Scheer (Black Monday).\n\nFrom Amblin, Twisters is directed by Lee Isaac Chung and is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall (Jurassic and Indiana Jones franchises) and by Patrick Crowley (Jurassic and Bourne franchises).

Negative shit to say when we get this way\nHavin' a fit today\nSo they wanna make a bitch decay\nMy son's mom went gone I was really wrong\nI thought I was gone\nI vomit so shame for my son\nBut I didn't go John Muhammad\nSo the devil's right here\nOn this level wide tier\nThat’s cuz when rebels ready to pop the heavy metal I fear\nAbomination, babin' Fakin'\nConsecration Hatin' Wastin' education\nGot the killer, wanna kill ‘em gotta chase em’\nGo!\nGo!\n\nSpiraling out of control\nAnd deeper down the rabbit hole\n\nFOLLOW FALLING IN REVERSE\n▶ Store: https://fallinginreverse.ffm.to/store\n▶ Website: http://fallinginreverse.com\n▶ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/fallinginreverseofficial\n▶ Instagram: http://instagram.com/fallinginreverse\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/FIROfficial\n▶ Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3HeKLgc\n▶ Apple: https://apple.co/3uUNHLt\n▶ Amazon: https://amzn.to/3pzVPOf\n______________________\n\nEpitaph Records is an artist-first indie label founded in Los Angeles by Bad Religion guitarist, Brett Gurewitz.
