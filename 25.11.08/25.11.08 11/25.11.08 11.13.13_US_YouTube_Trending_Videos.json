How's your day going?\nYou know that you can always say what's on your mind\nAre you on your way home?\nI'll warm up yo plate when you arrive\nHang yo coat, take off ya shoes, hot water in the tub for you\nDon't have to, but I love to do\nBartender, I'll pour a drink, a movie on to entertain\nI'm down to do the little things\n\nJust wanna take some time to thank ya\nAnd let you know just how you make me proud\nThe good times make up for the bad ones\nI see you trying, and I don't know how\nYou keep up with me when ya working\nSwitch ya timing when our schedules aren't aligning\nThat's a sign, that's a sign\nThat it's okay to finally tell the world that you are more than enough, еnough, enough\nFor me\n\nBe right hеre when you waking up\nBreakfast on the table, know you like\nEggs and they're all scrambled up\nPancakes, bacon, OJ on the side\nPacked your bag with extra clothes, yo toothbrush in the Louis tote\nLove notes for when you on the road (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nCleaned yo watch and Cuban links\nSilk pillowcase for you to take\nBoy, you deserve the little things, yeah, yeah\n\nJust wanna take some time to thank ya\nAnd let you know just how you make me proud\nThe good times make up for the bad ones\nI see you trying, and I don't know how\nYou keep up with me when ya working\nSwitch ya timing when our schedules aren't aligning\nThat's a sign, that's a sign\nThat it's okay to finally tell the world that you are more than enough, enough, enough\nFor me\n\nMore than I can say\nAnd you keep giving me more and more each day\nOh, baby, and I never thought I'd end up with\nThe man of my dreams, you really him\nI don't mind taking time, baby, I'm down to do the little things\nMore than I can say\nAnd you keep giving me more and more each day\nOh, baby, and I never thought I'd end up with\nThe man of my dreams, you really him\nI don't mind taking time, baby, I'm down to do the little things\n\nI'm down to do the little things\nI'm down to do the little things (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYeah, yeah, I don't mind taking time\nBaby, I'm down to do the little things\n\n#EllaMai #LittleThings #10Summers\n\nMusic video by Ella Mai performing Little Things.© 2025 10 Summers Records, LLC",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”).

Having painted a stampeding, spirited portrait of the American West with his sophomore album White Buffalo in 2023, Munsick is expanding on the concepts of the land, people, culture and stories that inspire him, on his most recent 20-track album, Eagle Feather, released on April 18, 2025. In addition to selling over 100,000 headlining tickets in 2024, Munsick also opened on select dates of Lainey Wilson’s Country’s Cool Again Tour and supported Morgan Wallen on select dates of his record-setting One Night At A Time Tour. Munsick concluded his spring Horses Are Faster Tour in Nashville. He has been named an “Artist to Watch” by Spotify, CMT, Fender, MusicRow and most recently was named a Martin Showcase Artist. Standout duet “Long Live Cowgirls” (with Cody Johnson) off of White Buffalo hit No. 1 on SiriusXM’s The Highway Hot 30 Countdown, was named one of Amazon Music’s Best Country Songs of 2022 and recently received RIAA Gold-certification alongside “Long Haul” and “Horses Are Faster.” Fans of Ian Munsick will always find an open heart, natural awe and plainspoken honesty as he rides on… bringing the West to the rest.

Having painted a stampeding, spirited portrait of the American West with his sophomore album White Buffalo in 2023, Munsick is expanding on the concepts of the land, people, culture and stories that inspire him, on his most recent 20-track album, Eagle Feather, released on April 18, 2025. In addition to selling over 100,000 headlining tickets in 2024, Munsick also opened on select dates of Lainey Wilson’s Country’s Cool Again Tour and supported Morgan Wallen on select dates of his record-setting One Night At A Time Tour. Munsick concluded his spring Horses Are Faster Tour in Nashville. He has been named an “Artist to Watch” by Spotify, CMT, Fender, MusicRow and most recently was named a Martin Showcase Artist. Standout duet “Long Live Cowgirls” (with Cody Johnson) off of White Buffalo hit No. 1 on SiriusXM’s The Highway Hot 30 Countdown, was named one of Amazon Music’s Best Country Songs of 2022 and recently received RIAA Gold-certification alongside “Long Haul” and “Horses Are Faster.” Fans of Ian Munsick will always find an open heart, natural awe and plainspoken honesty as he rides on… bringing the West to the rest.

A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric.

She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.\n\nShe has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.\n \n\n#AnneMarie #[Song Title] #[Album Title]",

Are you climbing up the walls?\nAre you deafened by the headlines? Or does your head not hear at all? Are you pacified by passion?\nAre you armed to the teeth?\nAre you bubbling at the surface, of what’s cooking underneath?\nAre you dying for an answer?\nFrom what they call good grief?\nBut there’s a terrific chance there’s nothing, beyond what you believe\n\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m in glory\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m going to get no glory\nRunning to the exit with a huge grin on my face \nScreaming hope is behind and I wanna get high\n\nI went to the liquor store and they took all my money\nI stared into the mirror there and begged a man to love me\nDo you love your blessed father? Anoint by fear of death\nDo you feel the lies creep on by? As soft as baby’s breath\nDo you beg that truth will set you free? Are you shackled by the keys?\nWell if I was you, I’d stay strapped in, cos’ all you’ve got is me.\n\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m in glory\nOh don’t you say that you think I’m going to get no glory\nRunning to the exit with a huge grin on my face \nScreaming hope is behind and I wanna get high\n\n#themountain #gorillaz #newmusic #kong"

                "description": "Ми ПОВЕРНУЛИСЯ в казино, і я не піду, поки не зірву БОНУС У ВИГЛЯД ПЕЛЬМЕНЬКІВ на ігровому автоматі Tasty Treasures! Перший оберт... десятитрильйонний оберт... МЕНІ БАЙДУЖЕ, ХОДІМО! Дякую всім за перегляд! Ви всі прекрасні, і я щиро ціную кожного з вас за те, що ви долучилися до цієї шаленої подорожі. Побажайте мені удачі, і побачимося наступного разу! Ходімо на війну!\n\nГрайте у свої улюблені слоти та настільні ігри абсолютно безкоштовно за адресою: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nБреттскі пройшов через двері казино з рюкзаком, який здавався важчим, ніж зазвичай, — не через гроші всередині, а тому, що це було все, що у нього залишилося. Усі його заощадження. Кожен зароблений, зекономлений і зібраний долар був запханий між його толстовкою та однією метою: зірвати бонус у вигляді пельменів Tasty Treasures.\n\nВін колись бачив це в прямому ефірі — три золоті пельмені, що обертаються на місці, запускаючи бонус, який може перетворити чиїсь гроші на оренду на статок. Сьогодні ввечері це мав бути він.\n\nВін знайшов автомат, що світився в кутку, наполовину зламаний, його екран мерехтів між кольорами, ніби він знав щось, чого він не знав. Він сів, хруснув кісточками пальців і вставив першу пачку банкнот у слот.\n\nПерші кілька обертів були жорстокими. Мертві оберти, дражнилки, майже промахи. Він програв половину ще до того, як автомат моргнув. Потім — дзинь, дзинь, дзинь! — міні-бонус. 400 доларів. Небагато, але достатньо, щоб підтримувати вогонь.\n\nВін збільшив ставку. 50 доларів за оберт. Потім 100 доларів. Його серце калатало, як барабанна струна. Потім це сталося — два вареники… і третій з'явився в останню секунду. Екран вибухнув золотим світлом. «БОНУС ЗА ПЕЛЬМЕНИ АКТИВОВАНО!»\n\nАвтомат ожив, зашипіла пара, вареники закружляли по екрану. Один за одним вони показували множники. 5x. 10x. 25x. Він палав, аж поки остання галушка не засвітилася червоним. З'явилася нова підказка: «ПОДВІЙНИЙ АБО НІЧОГО БОНУС — Прийняти?»\n\nБреттскі завмер. Натовп навколо нього ахнув. На екрані у нього лежало понад 47 000 доларів. Кнопка «Ні» слабо мерехтіла, майже спонукаючи його натиснути «Так».\n\nВін потягнувся до екрана — коли раптом автомат погас.\n\nПозаду нього з'явилася службовиця казино, бліда.\n«Сер», — прошепотіла вона. «Цей автомат не працює вже два роки…»\n\n#слоти #блекджек #азартніігри #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nХто такий Бреттскі? Бреттскі — професійний гравець, подібний до давніх легенд Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, TheBigJackpot або Lady Luck HQ! Однак, на відміну від цих легенд, Бреттскі зберігає тисячі років стародавніх знань, зібраних старійшинами, у таких навичках, як ігрові автомати, рулетка, блекджек, крепс, крэпс з бабл-грапом, покер та баккара. Мета Бреттскі як професійного гравця проста: володіти всім Лас-Вегасом, використовуючи кошти, зароблені в азартних іграх. Підпишіться, щоб підтримати його шлях до світового панування."

L'écran explosa de lumière dorée. « BONUS BOULETTES ACTIVÉ ! »\n\nLa machine s'anima, la vapeur sifflant, des multiplicateurs tournoyant sur l'écran.

Все его сбережения. Каждый заработанный, сэкономленный и наскребленный доллар был засунут между толстовкой и единственной целью: выиграть Пельменный бонус Tasty Treasures.\n\nОн однажды видел это в прямом эфире: три золотых пельменя, вращающихся на месте, запускают бонус, который может превратить чьи-то арендные деньги в целое состояние. Сегодня вечером это должен был быть он.\n\nОн обнаружил автомат, светящийся в углу, наполовину сломанный, его экран мерцал разными цветами, словно он знал что-то, чего он не знал. Он сел, хрустнул костяшками пальцев и сунул первую пачку купюр в слот.\n\nПервые несколько вращений были жестокими. Вялые вращения, поддразнивания, почти промахи. Он проиграл половину, прежде чем автомат даже моргнул. Затем — динь, динь, динь! — мини-бонус. 400 долларов. Немного, но достаточно, чтобы поддерживать огонь.\n\nОн увеличил ставку. 50 долларов за вращение. Затем 100 долларов. Сердце забилось, как барабанная дробь. И тут это случилось — два пельменя… и третий в последнюю секунду соскользнул на место. Экран взорвался золотым светом. «БОНУС «ПЕЛЬМЕНИ» АКТИВИРОВАН!»\n\nИгровой автомат ожил, шипя паром, пельмени закрутились на экране. Один за другим открывались множители. 5x. 10x. 25x. Он горел, пока последний пельмень не загорелся красным. Вспыхнула новая подсказка: «УДВОЕНИЕ ИЛИ НИЧЕГО — Принять?»\n\nБретски замер. Толпа вокруг ахнула. На экране было больше 47 000 долларов. Кнопка «Нет» слабо мигнула, почти призывая его нажать «Да».\n\nОн потянулся к экрану — и вдруг автомат погас.\n\nПозади него появился санитар казино с бледным лицом.\n\n«Сэр», — прошептала она. — «Этот автомат не работает уже два года…»\n\n#слоты #блэкджек #азартные игры #казино #баккара #рулетка\n\nКто такой Бреттски?

Er setzte sich, ließ die Knöchel knacken und warf den ersten Geldscheinbündel in den Schlitz.\n\nDie ersten paar Drehungen waren brutal. Nieten, Enttäuschungen, knappe Gewinne.

Nicht viel, aber genug, um die Motivation aufrechtzuerhalten.\n\nEr erhöhte den Einsatz. 50 Dollar pro Drehung. Dann 100 Dollar. Sein Herz hämmerte wie verrückt. Dann geschah es – zwei Teigtaschen … und eine dritte glitt im letzten Moment an ihren Platz. Der Bildschirm explodierte in goldenem Licht. „TEMPEL-BONUS AKTIVIERT!“\n\nDie Maschine erwachte zum Leben, Dampf zischte, und kleine Kugeln wirbelten über den Bildschirm.

                "description": "We are BACK at the Casino, and I AIN'T LEAVIN until we hit a DUMPLING BONUS on the Tasty Treasures Slot Machine! First spin... ten trillionth spin... I DON'T CARE, LET'S GO! Thank you all for watching! You’re all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I’ll see you in the next one! Let’s go to war!\n\nPlay your favorite slots and table games completely for free at: https://spinquest.com/?u=brettski\n\nBrettski walked through the casino doors with a backpack that felt heavier than usual—not because of the cash inside, but because it was everything he had left. His entire life savings. Every dollar earned, saved, and scraped together was stuffed between his hoodie and a single goal: to hit the Tasty Treasures dumpling bonus.\n\nHe’d seen it on stream once—three golden dumplings spinning into place, triggering a bonus that could turn someone’s rent money into a fortune. Tonight, it had to be him.\n\nHe found the machine glowing in the corner, half-broken, its screen flickering between colors like it knew something he didn’t. He sat down, cracked his knuckles, and fed the first wad of bills into the slot.\n\nThe first few spins were brutal. Dead spins, teases, near-misses. He was down half before the machine even blinked. Then—ding, ding, ding!—a mini bonus. $400. Not much, but enough to keep the fire burning.\n\nHe increased the bet. $50 a spin. Then $100. His heart pounded like a drumline. Then it happened—two dumplings… and a third one slid into place at the last second. The screen exploded in golden light. “DUMPLING BONUS ACTIVATED!”\n\nThe machine came alive, steam hissing, dumplings spinning across the screen. One by one, they revealed multipliers. 5x. 10x. 25x. He was on fire—until the final dumpling glowed red. A new prompt flashed: “DOUBLE OR NOTHING BONUS — Accept?”\n\nBrettski froze. The crowd around him gasped. He had over $47,000 sitting on the screen. The “No” button flickered weakly, almost urging him to press “Yes.”\n\nHe reached for the screen—when suddenly, the machine went dark.\n\nA casino attendant appeared behind him, face pale.\n“Sir,” she whispered. “That machine’s been offline for two years…”\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski?
