            "description": "Krypto, take us home. #Superman - Only in Theaters July 11\n\n“Superman,” DC Studios’ first feature film to hit the big screen, is set to soar into theaters worldwide this summer from Warner Bros. Pictures.  In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind.\n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with editors William Hoy (“The Batman”), Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Flash”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).\n\n“Superman” will be in theaters and IMAX nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.",

Pictures.  In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind.\n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with editors William Hoy (“The Batman”), Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Flash”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).\n\n“Superman” will be in theaters and IMAX nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures."

And this time she’s not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon—led by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and writer-director Gerard Johnstone—reboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0. Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on\na murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently\ndestroyed, M3GAN’s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma’s niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma’s overprotective rules.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia’s self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. \n\nWith the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I icon is about to meet her match.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 is written and directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone, from a story by Gerard Johnstone and Akela Cooper, based on characters created by Akela Cooper & James Wan.\n\nThe film co-stars returning cast members Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps as Gemma’s loyal tech teammates, Cole and Tess, and new characters played by Aristotle Athari (Saturday Night Live, Hacks), Timm Sharp (Apples Never Fall, Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement (Avatar: The Way of Water, What We Do in the Shadows). \n\nProduced by James Wan, Jason Blum and Allison Williams, the film is executive produced by Gerard Johnstone, Adam Hendricks, Greg Gilreath, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Mark D. Katchur. \n\nThe first M3GAN film shattered box office records, opening to $30.4 million domestically to become the biggest opening weekend for a PG-13 horror film since A Quiet Place Part II. The film went on to gross more than $180 million worldwide.",

                "description": "oops! she did it again!\n#M3GAN2 is only in theaters June 27. \n\n---\nWebsite: http://www.M3GANmovie.com\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/universalpictures  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meetM3GAN/\nX: https://twitter.com/meetm3gan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/M3GAN/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/m3gan\n\n\nThe murderous doll who captivated pop culture in 2023 is back. And this time she’s not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon—led by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and writer-director Gerard Johnstone—reboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0. Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on\na murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently\ndestroyed, M3GAN’s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma’s niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma’s overprotective rules.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia’s self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. \n\nWith the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I icon is about to meet her match.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 is written and directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone, from a story by Gerard Johnstone and Akela Cooper, based on characters created by Akela Cooper & James Wan.\n\nThe film co-stars returning cast members Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps as Gemma’s loyal tech teammates, Cole and Tess, and new characters played by Aristotle Athari (Saturday Night Live, Hacks), Timm Sharp (Apples Never Fall, Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement (Avatar: The Way of Water, What We Do in the Shadows). \n\nProduced by James Wan, Jason Blum and Allison Williams, the film is executive produced by Gerard Johnstone, Adam Hendricks, Greg Gilreath, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Mark D. Katchur. \n\nThe first M3GAN film shattered box office records, opening to $30.4 million domestically to become the biggest opening weekend for a PG-13 horror film since A Quiet Place Part II. The film went on to gross more than $180 million worldwide."

The new single “End of the World” out now.\n\nLyrics:\n\nToday, you woke up, and you told me that you wanted to cry\nThe sky was falling like a comet on the fourth of July\n\nBaby you’ve been thinking ’bout the future like it’s already yours\nShow me how you’d hold me if tomorrow wasn’t coming for sure\nLet’s pretend it’s not the end of the world\nLet’s pretend it’s not the end of the world\n\nLet’s spend the dollars you’ve been saving on a Mercedes Benz\nAnd throw a party like McCartney with some help from our friends\nYeah let’s go down to Malibu and watch the sun fade out once more\nShow me how you’d hold me if tomorrow was coming for sure\nLet’s pretend it’s not the end of the world\nLet’s pretend it’s not the end of the world\nThe sky is falling, falling like a comet now\nI can see it coming down\nThe sky is falling, falling like a comet now\n\nOoh let’s go to Paris\nI don’t care if we get lost in the scene\nPaint the city like Picasso would’ve done in his dreams\nDo all the things that we were way too terrified of before\nI wanna take you to nirvana\nWe can’t take it too far\nHit the bottom of the bottle and forget who we are\nHold me close, you know tomorrow isn’t coming for sure\nLet’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world\nLet’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world\nLet’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world\n\nLet’s pretend\nIt’s not the end\nLet’s pretend\nIt’s not the end\nLet’s pretend\nIt’s not the end\n\nLet’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world\nThe sky is falling, falling like a comet now\nLet’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world\nThe sky is falling, falling like a comet now\nLet’s pretend that it’s not the end of the world\nThe sky is falling, falling like a comet now\nI can see it coming down\n\nCredits:\n\nColumbia Records and Live Nation present a Miley Cyrus and XYZ Films Production\nMiley Cyrus “Something Beautiful”\n\nDirected by: Miley Cyrus, Jacob Bixenman, Brendan Walter\nProduced by: Miley Cyrus, Panos Cosmatos, Nick Spicer, Nate Bolotin, Aram Tertzakian\nExecutive Producers: Adam Folk, Ron Perry, Tom Mackay, Krista Wegener, Michael Rapino, Brad Wavra, Ryan Kroft\nAssociate Producer: Marcela Victoria\nDirector of Photography: Benoît Debie\nProduction Designer: David Meyer\nChoreography by: Stephen Galloway\nCostume Design: Bradley Kenneth \nEdited by: Brendan Walter\n\nMusic Produced by: Miley Cyrus, Shawn Everett, Michael Pollack, Jonathan Rado, and Maxx Morando\nEngineered by: Shawn Everett, Ian Gold, and Pièce Eatah at The Village\nAssistant Engineer: JC LeResche\nMixed & Mastered by: Shawn Everett\nMix Assistant: Ian Gold\n\nConnect with Miley Cyrus\nSite: http://mileycyrus.com\nTwitter: https://mileyl.ink/twitter\nInstagram: https://mileyl.ink/instagram\nTikTok: https://mileyl.ink/tiktok\nFacebook: https://mileyl.ink/facebook\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/mileycyrus\n\n#MileyCyrus #EndoftheWorld #SomethingBeautiful"

            "description": "We’re not sure how... but Kylie is SOMEHOW BACK for a brand new episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Nanit just days after giving birth to her and Jason’s fourth baby girl, Finnley Anne Kelce.\n\nKylie starts things off by explaining why it was so important to her to record a Postpartum Special immediately after having her baby and introduces Baby Finn to the Real Ones for the first time. She also concludes the baby name search saga and explains how they ultimately decided on Finn’s first and middle names.\n\nThen, in a postpartum edition of “Can I Be Honest?” Kylie details her birth story, sharing everything from her labor experience, to that “fat needle in her back” to Jason’s all-pro level skills as a support person and cord cutter. \n\nAfter that, even on very minimal sleep, Kylie brings some fire to a fan favorite segment, except this time it’s the sequel: The Dos & Don’ts of Talking to Postpartum Women. Kylie highlights the things she least appreciates hearing like “sleep while the baby is sleeping” and also shares some advice on what can be helpful to new moms.\n\nAlso, in honor of her fourth baby girl, Kylie answers 4ish questions about the first couple days of being a family of six, including how the first meeting went for all four Kelce sisters and who Finn looks like the most.\n\nThen, Kylie brings back one of her personal favorite segments “You Know What’s F*cked Up?” to touch on the subject of “newborn bliss.” Kylie opens up about her past experiences with postpartum anxiety with the help of a special guest – acclaimed author, therapist and advocate for maternal mental health – Rebecca Fox Starr.\n\nKylie asks Rebecca about the signs women and their families can look out for when it comes to postpartum depression, what needs to be fixed with the current screening system used by most hospitals, who to contact for help and the common misconceptions about “baby blues.” \n\nMake sure you tune into More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for more exclusive clips!

And what does this mean for other countries on a similar path?\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤️ https://shop.kgs.link\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of kurzgesagt soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe soundtrack of this video:\nSoundCloud: https://bit.ly/3E02bka\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/4cfFBRt\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nThomas Heffernan, Lily, Allan Curtis, Gick, Patrick Bonner, Mee Chan, Benno, Inma Reis, Erin McKeehan, Danielle Ritchie, Fernando Gámez Losada, Krunk, Owen Smith, Alex Bouez, David McCormack, Kévain G., BrentD, Katie Garber, Kevin Aluwi, icyberg, Boris, Cobaltergeist, Matzuta, Jaken8tor, Tina Martinez, TheNocturnist, Arjun Singh, Sidney Story, ManlioRN, TNT TV Gaming, OffBeatBunny, Haezan, Marcin Gajda, Jindřich Vlášek"

            "description": "Minecraft Speedrunner VS 3 Hunters. This is the real version of the April Fools VS 3 hunters Minecraft Manhunt. Did we fool you?\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dreams.is\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there are three hunters instead of just one. This was recorded for April Fools, so there are some interesting things changed in order to make the main channel video possible. That's why item's can't be picked up and anything else that might be weird.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend GeorgeNotFound AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend Awesamdude tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nIf this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do a rematch!\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MinecraftManhunt",

                "description": "Minecraft Speedrunner VS 3 Hunters. This is the real version of the April Fools VS 3 hunters Minecraft Manhunt. Did we fool you?\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nMerch: https://www.dreams.is\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there are three hunters instead of just one. This was recorded for April Fools, so there are some interesting things changed in order to make the main channel video possible. That's why item's can't be picked up and anything else that might be weird.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.16 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend GeorgeNotFound AND my friend Sapnap AND my friend Awesamdude tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nIf this video gets 1,000,000 likes we'll do a rematch!\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\n#MinecraftManhunt"

He didn’t ask for much during soundcheck, just a preview of beats from The Band of Brothas and a shot of espresso. He was about to do something that had never been done at Tiny Desk before — freestyle an entire set “off the dome.”\n\nIt’s been over nine years since Droppa dropped his debut mixtape, which featured heavy hitters like Migos, Big Sean, Nick Jonas and more. “Every time I see people,” the rapper shares during his set, “the first thing they say is ‘Droppa where you been? When you gonna give us more?’ ” Well, the answer is now. Those who aren’t hip may recognize the emcee as his alter-ego, Kevin Hart, who’s become a household name in comedy and acting. But this unscripted set proves that Chocolate Droppa’s rap game is equally entertaining.

A couple of explorers, modern-day documentarians, and cultivators of curiosity.\n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?

It takes time to talk to strangers, and even more time to have a real connection.  Going the extra mile to get to know someone is a commitment. \n\nWhich is why these are our most treasured experiences.

Now, she finds herself once again in the waiting room of Brighter Days Inc., but this time for a very different appointment. The company now offers advanced memory restoration, allowing her to revisit a curated selection of moments from her life—both cherished and painful. As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today. She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma. In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there’s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\n \nSet against the music of eternal sunshine deluxe: brighter days ahead, and directed by frequent collaborators Christian Breslauer and Ariana Grande, this film explores love, loss, growth, and the fleeting nature of memory, delivering a heartfelt cinematic experience that closes the door on this eternal sunshine album era.\n\n►Subscribe to Ariana Grande: http://ArianaGrande.lnk.to/subscribe\n \n►Follow Ariana Grande\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/arianagrande/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/arianagrande \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@arianagrande\nWebsite: https://www.arianagrande.com/ \n \n#arianagrande #brighterdaysahead #eternalsunshine\n\n\nMusic video by Ariana Grande performing brighter days ahead.© 2025 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.",

Like what happens after Wendy falls? Did she die? What does Peter do? Fairies are still dying so like, thats still a problem. \n\nI had lots of fun with this one as you can probably tell! I wanted it to feel stylistically the same as the previous song with some new ideas and with a good finish to the story so that Tinks story could have a nice sharp full stop so that’s what we’ve attempted to do here. I hope you love it as much as we loved making it!!\n\nHUGE thank you to all the incredible people that helped this project some to life!! I’ll be crediting them all below this \nstory so do go check out their work! \n\nVILLAIN STORY \n\nWendy is dead. Finally Tink and her friends were safe again, but was that a step too far? Tinkerbell had no other choice right? If she’d let Wendy live then Peter Pan would’ve left Neverland, left Tinkerbell and stopped believing in fairies. Tinks very existence had rested on a knife edge. So Wendy had to go. \n\nThe first laugh of a newborn baby is what brings fairies into existence and, as Tink previously discovered, it is that same child that stops believing that then ends the same fairies life. Tink and her friends had found the children they were connected to, Peter Pan and the Lost boys. And Wendy and her brothers had almost taken them away until she’d intervened. Now Tink and her friends were safe it was their responsibility to help the whole of Pixie Hollow. Fairies were still dying out, the other inhabitants were fading at an alarming rate.\n\nTo ensure their people’s continued existence Tink and her friends would have to do something bigger, something drastic to ensure humans never stopped believing in fairies.\n\nLuckily Tink has been experimenting with Pixie Dust, searching for a way to bring fairies back from the dead. Sadly, she never did find a way to revive fawn and Silvermist. But she did happen upon a way to enhance their powers, weaponise them, to create an army charged with Pixie Dust. Tinkerbell knew that much power in one fairies hands was wrong, but with the crisis she was facing she didn’t have a choice. \n\nNow with almost limitless power at her fingertips, Tink and her friends finally had a solution to their problem. But she has another foe to face first. Peter Pan won’t sit idly by after the death of Wendy. Tink crossed a line she may well regret crossing very soon…\n\n\nByyyeeeee\n\nPS.

Previously, Mbappé had put Ancelotti's side ahead by converting a Panenka-style penalty. There was no option but to turn the game around after the break, and the equaliser came almost straight from the kick-off. In the 47th minute, Bellingham, with hardly any space, worked a shot inside the box but Dmitrovic responded with a fine save. The rebound fell to Brahim, his shot was blocked by Tapia on the line, but the ball hit the crossbar and Bellingham was on hand to acrobatically slot it home. The minutes ticked by and in the 76th minute came the deserved reward of the third goal. Mbappé scored from a masterful indirect free kick from the edge of the area, the Frenchman's second consecutive brace. From then until the end, Ancelotti's men were able to hold on to their advantage and take all three points.\n#RealMadridLeganés | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT",

Antes, Mbappé había adelantado a los de Ancelotti al convertir un penalti a lo Panenka. Había que dar la vuelta al marcador tras el paso por los vestuarios y nada más salir llegó el empate. Bellingham, sin apenas espacio, se sacó en el 47’ un disparo dentro del área que obtuvo como respuesta una gran estirada de Dmitrovic. El rechazo llegó a Brahim y su remate fue repelido por Tapia sobre la línea de gol, pero el balón golpeó en el larguero y Bellingham apareció para llevarlo a la red con un remate acrobático. Transcurrían los minutos y en el 76’ llegó el merecido premio del tercer gol. Lo firmó Mbappé en un magistral libre indirecto desde la frontal del área. Segundo doblete consecutivo del galo. De ahí hasta el final, los de Ancelotti supieron mantener la renta obtenida y sumar los tres puntos. \n#RealMadridLeganés | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT"

But they haven’t done it alone, of course: the Super Mario Bros includes Luigi and Tails is never far from Sonic.
