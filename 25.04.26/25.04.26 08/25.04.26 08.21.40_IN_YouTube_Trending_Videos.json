            "description": "The massive terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, while spreading shock and horror, also showed hope as multiple heroes stepped forward from among the locals. One such was Sajad Ahmed Bhatt. A video of him carrying a boy, injured when the terrorists opened fire on a group of tourists, killing 26 people, has been widely circulated. The video shows Mr Bhatt running downhill over the rocky terrain, his steps never faltering. The boy was on his back, clad in Mr Bhatt's orange jacket to keep him warm.\n\n#PahalgamAttack #PahalgamTouristsAttack #PahalgamKashmir #KashmirAttack #PMModi #JammuKashmirTerrorAttack #PahalgamAttack #JammuKashmirTerroristAttack #JammuKashmirAttack #TerroristAttackInKashmir #JammuKashmirNews #OmarAbdullah #AmitShah #TouristsAttackInKashmir #PahalgamNews #NDTVDigitalOriginals\n\nAbout NDTV (English news channel):\r\n\r\nNDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.
