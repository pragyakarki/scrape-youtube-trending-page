Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Next2U #Kehlani",

            "description": "Bobby Carter | May 31, 2024\nThe vibrancy that bounces off the screen while watching Sean Paul’s Tiny Desk concert is undeniable. Hearing his voice just a few feet away was an overwhelming experience, and I overheard a few NPR staffers in attendance who agreed. “He sounds just like the record!” they said, moving like nobody was watching. Admittedly, we don’t host enough dancehall artists at the Tiny Desk so there was an element of surprise at play. But the Jamaican superstar’s catalog boasts some of the world's biggest party anthems; it should've been a no-brainer when working with that. “This ain’t no Tiny Desk no more,” Paul said as he strutted to the Desk, preparing to turn the office into a bashment party.\n\nPaul took reggae and dancehall to new heights in the early 2000s. After hopping on any and every riddim for the clubs and dropping his debut, Stage One, the breakthrough came with his second album, Dutty Rock, in 2002. The global reach of that album shifted the music industry and everyone from the biggest pop star to the grimiest emcee needed the Sean Paul effect on their albums. For his set, the game plan was simple, all gas and no breaks; energetic hit after hit including “Gimme the Light”, “Get Busy,” “Like Glue” and topping things off with “Temperature.”\n\nSET LIST\n“Gimme the Light”\n“Get Busy”\n“Infiltrate”\n“I'm Still in Love With You”\n“Deport Them”\n“Like Glue”\n“Temperature”\n\nMUSICIANS\nSean “Sean Paul” Henriques: lead vocals\nNigel A.

            "description": "Moana and Maui are back🐚🌊🪝 \nWatch the new trailer for Disney’s #Moana2 now and see the movie only in theaters November 27, 2024!\n\nCheck out the new teaser trailer for Walt Disney Animated Studios’ “Moana 2.” Moana voyages back to the big screen this November in the all-new feature film starring Auli‘i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson as Moana and demigod Maui, respectively. A trailer, poster and images are now available to share with your readers.\n \nOpening only in theaters Nov. 27, 2024, “Moana 2” reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced. Directed by David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller, and produced by Christina Chen and Yvett Merino, “Moana 2” features music by Grammy® winners Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear, Grammy nominee Opetaia Foaʻi, and three-time Grammy winner Mark Mancina.\n \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@disneyanimation\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disneyanimation/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyAnimation\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@disneyanimation\n#moana2",

Ever since Kendrick released his \"Like That\" verse the world has been on fire with talk about how each rapper mentioned would respond. J.Cole and Drake definitely took different routes and hip hop has been the talk of pop culture since the back and forth started. \n\nWay more people have had problems with Drake since his career started than most know. He's actually been in conflicts with Common, Pharrell, and Diddy. Some have come back up in this beef with Kendrick but new ones have popped up like with Rick Ross, The Weeknd, Asap Rocky, Metro Boomin, Future, and Kanye. \n\nIf everyone you've ever worked with or looked up to eventually hates you you have to wonder if you're not the problem. Kendrick has released 4 diss tracks that span old school hip hop, funk, jazz, and an eclectic mix of beats. No matter who you were rooting for going in to this there is no doubt that fans have walked away with a different impression of both rappers. \n\nThanks for watching. If you enjoy please share with someone who could use a laugh and most of all thanks for being my friends.\n\nIf you love my stories I have a podcast that comes out every week: https://bit.ly/3NQmpio \n\nHit me on them internets: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@joshjohnsoncomedy\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy \n\nVideo Directed by Eric Shepard\nRecorded at Funny Bone in Dayton, OH",

                "description": "Come see me live:\nJune 7-9 Kansas City, MO https://bit.ly/3PZWHZt\nJuly 25-28 Denver, CO https://bit.ly/3Jxn6dG\nAugust 2-3 Atlanta, GA https://bit.ly/3UYyogq\nAugust 23 Omaha, NE https://bit.ly/3x4wHFY\nSept 18 Tucson, AZ https://bit.ly/3R0p1eM\nSept 19-21 Phoenix, AZ https://bit.ly/4agm7JP\nCheck out https://joshjohnsoncomedy.com/tour for more dates!\n\nHi Friends,\n\nThis week I wanted to share my thoughts on the Kendrick and Drake beef, some of the backstory leading up to it and the overall fallout. Ever since Kendrick released his \"Like That\" verse the world has been on fire with talk about how each rapper mentioned would respond. J.Cole and Drake definitely took different routes and hip hop has been the talk of pop culture since the back and forth started. \n\nWay more people have had problems with Drake since his career started than most know. He's actually been in conflicts with Common, Pharrell, and Diddy. Some have come back up in this beef with Kendrick but new ones have popped up like with Rick Ross, The Weeknd, Asap Rocky, Metro Boomin, Future, and Kanye. \n\nIf everyone you've ever worked with or looked up to eventually hates you you have to wonder if you're not the problem. Kendrick has released 4 diss tracks that span old school hip hop, funk, jazz, and an eclectic mix of beats. No matter who you were rooting for going in to this there is no doubt that fans have walked away with a different impression of both rappers. \n\nThanks for watching. If you enjoy please share with someone who could use a laugh and most of all thanks for being my friends.\n\nIf you love my stories I have a podcast that comes out every week: https://bit.ly/3NQmpio \n\nHit me on them internets: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@joshjohnsoncomedy\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy \n\nVideo Directed by Eric Shepard\nRecorded at Funny Bone in Dayton, OH"

In this case, we got the itch to stick a 6.2l Supercharged V8 out of a 2018 Hellcat into @scraplifefernando Nissan 350z!\n\nMore power, blower noises, V8 torque.. It all sounds great, but as we quickly learn, this won't be the easiest of swaps (for obvious reasons...)\n\nHave a wild Mopar build story of your own?

In a separate bowl, beat 3 egg yolks and ¼ cup sugar with a hand mixer until ribbony, then stream in ¼ cup neutral oil, ¼ cup buttermilk, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Pour the yolk mixture into the flour mixture and whisk until smooth. In a separate bowl, combine three egg whites, ¼ cup sugar, and a pinch of cream of tartar and beat with an electric mixer to stiff peaks. Fold the whites into the batter, then scrape onto a parchment-lined half sheet tray. Bake in a 225-degree oven until springy to the touch and golden, then let cool. Trim the edges then cut the sponge into 6-cm-wide strips and trim them horizontally so they’re about 7mm thick. Freeze the pieces. \n\nTo make the filling, combine 3 ounces egg whites, 5.5 ounces of sugar, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and a pinch of cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer set over a double boiler and stir until the sugar dissolves. Whip the egg whites until firm peaks form and the meringue is room temperature, then gradually beat in 10 ounces of room temperature butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in 1 tablespoon of vanilla paste. Pipe a layer of buttercream onto the surfaces of the cake strips using a basketweave tip, then sandwich the cake together. Chill briefly, then cut out hexagons using a serrated knife and template. Chill the cakes. \n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together 4 cups powdered sugar, ¼ cup hot water, ¼ cup light corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract until smooth. Whisk in 142g melted white chocolate, then thin with more hot water to the desired consistency. Place over a saucepan of hot water to keep warm. Spread a thin layer over the tops of the cakes, let set at room temperature, then place the cakes one at a time glaze-size down on a large fork and spoon the glaze over the cakes until fully enrobed. Place on a wire rack and let set. Pipe thin lines of melted chocolate over the surfaces of the cakes in a wavy pattern and let set.",

In a separate bowl, beat 3 egg yolks and ¼ cup sugar with a hand mixer until ribbony, then stream in ¼ cup neutral oil, ¼ cup buttermilk, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Pour the yolk mixture into the flour mixture and whisk until smooth. In a separate bowl, combine three egg whites, ¼ cup sugar, and a pinch of cream of tartar and beat with an electric mixer to stiff peaks. Fold the whites into the batter, then scrape onto a parchment-lined half sheet tray. Bake in a 225-degree oven until springy to the touch and golden, then let cool. Trim the edges then cut the sponge into 6-cm-wide strips and trim them horizontally so they’re about 7mm thick. Freeze the pieces. \n\nTo make the filling, combine 3 ounces egg whites, 5.5 ounces of sugar, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and a pinch of cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer set over a double boiler and stir until the sugar dissolves. Whip the egg whites until firm peaks form and the meringue is room temperature, then gradually beat in 10 ounces of room temperature butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in 1 tablespoon of vanilla paste. Pipe a layer of buttercream onto the surfaces of the cake strips using a basketweave tip, then sandwich the cake together. Chill briefly, then cut out hexagons using a serrated knife and template. Chill the cakes. \n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together 4 cups powdered sugar, ¼ cup hot water, ¼ cup light corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract until smooth. Whisk in 142g melted white chocolate, then thin with more hot water to the desired consistency. Place over a saucepan of hot water to keep warm. Spread a thin layer over the tops of the cakes, let set at room temperature, then place the cakes one at a time glaze-size down on a large fork and spoon the glaze over the cakes until fully enrobed. Place on a wire rack and let set. Pipe thin lines of melted chocolate over the surfaces of the cakes in a wavy pattern and let set."

The now-viral incident has taken social media by storm since the honorable Cedric Simpson's YouTube livestream showed defendant Corey Harris joining the May 15 Zoom call as he finished parking his vehicle. \"Mr. Harris, are you driving?” Simpson asked, adding, \"I don't even know why he would do that.\" Harris' public defender confirmed that he indeed was operating a moving vehicle, as both Simpson and Harris looked dumbfounded. Judge Simpson proceeded to revoke Harris' bond and order him to report to the Washtenaw County jail that night. Per CNN, Harris, who was reportedly charged with driving on a suspended license back in October 2023, has a pretrial hearing on June 5. \"This is an ongoing case and Washtenaw County has no comment.

There’s so much we love about the game now, but there was something unique at release in how alone you felt in the universe. Going further back I have great memories of early unreleased versions of No Man’s Sky where there were no NPCs, no shops, no help… just you the player as a tiny dot lost in the infinite.\n\nFor our next update we wanted to allow players to experience an alternative universe. We are calling it Adrift, and for the first time players can be truly alone in No Man’s Sky. We think it’s a special feeling.\n\nFull notes here: https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/05/expedition-thirteen-adrift/",

There’s so much we love about the game now, but there was something unique at release in how alone you felt in the universe. Going further back I have great memories of early unreleased versions of No Man’s Sky where there were no NPCs, no shops, no help… just you the player as a tiny dot lost in the infinite.\n\nFor our next update we wanted to allow players to experience an alternative universe. We are calling it Adrift, and for the first time players can be truly alone in No Man’s Sky. We think it’s a special feeling.\n\nFull notes here: https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/05/expedition-thirteen-adrift/"
