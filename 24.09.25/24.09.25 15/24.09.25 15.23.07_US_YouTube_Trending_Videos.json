Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

            "description": "From the world of Inside Out comes #DreamProductions 🎥 available December 11 and in 2025 comes #WinOrLose 🥎 available February 19, only on Disney+.\n\nABOUT “DREAM PRODUCTIONS”\nTaking place in between the events of “Inside Out” and “Inside Out 2,” “Dream Productions” is an all-new series about the studio inside Riley’s mind where dreams really do come true—every night, on time and on budget. Riley is growing up and when her memories need some extra processing, Joy and the rest of the Core Emotions send them to Dream Productions. Acclaimed director Paula Persimmon (voice of Paula Pell) faces a nightmare of her own: Trying to create the next hit dream after being paired up with Xeni (voice of Richard Ayoade), a smug daydream director looking to step up into the big leagues of night dreams. Also featuring the voices of Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Ally Maki, Kensington Tallman, Liza Lapira, Tony Hale, Lewis Black and Phyllis Smith, the hilarious, mockumentary-style series is written and directed by Mike Jones and produced by Jaclyn Simon.\n \nABOUT “WIN OR LOSE”\n“Win or Lose” reveals what it actually feels like to be in the shoes of eight different characters in the week leading up to the big game—the insecure kids, their helicopter parents, even a lovesick umpire—with incredibly funny, very emotional and uniquely animated perspectives. Featuring the voice of Will Forte as the coach, “Win or Lose” is directed, written and executive produced by Carrie Hobson and Michael Yates, and produced David Lally.",

            "description": "Stream this song here - https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/lydiathebard/i-only-paint-in-red-now-feat-tony-halliwell\n\nTold ya I’d turn her into a villain one day! As usual make sure to read the story below otherwise you will be well and truly lost ✌️ make sure to show some love to Lazyeule (animatic artist) amd Tony (music) in the comments! Thank you both youre the best! \n\nSTORY \n\nThere once lived a young girl named Alice, who found herself in a strange and mysterious place called Wonderland. The world she had entered was dark and beautiful, full of magic and mystery. At first, she was mesmerised by what she saw, but there was a darkness in the air, a quiet chaos in the very ground, almost as if the land was living, breathing. \n\nAlice’s wonder slowly turned to a growing unease. She began to find herself doing and saying things the past Alice wouldn’t have dreamed of, as whispers in her ear tempted her towards a new version of herself, scrambling her thoughts. It was almost as if Wonderland itself was infecting her with its madness. One moment, she was the curious and polite girl from her village, and the next, she was a twisted reflection of herself. Her laughter became a cackle, her smile a smirk, and her once-bright eyes glinted with a sinister light. Desperate to get back home and return to her normal self, Alice frantically searched for a way out. But each step forward seemed to pull her deeper into the clutches of Wonderland’s madness.\n\nIn the depths of the woods, she met the Caterpillar, who eyed her with a knowing look.\n\n“Who are you?” he asked.\n\n“I... I don’t know anymore,” Alice replied, her voice a mixture of confusion and despair. “I need to find my way home.”\n\nAlice’s desperation grew as she felt herself almost split in two, watching this darker version of herself slowly take over. If she could just find her way home before the Wonderland version of herself took full control, then the nightmare would finally be over. But Alice couldn’t have possibly known just how deep Wonderland’s roots were inside her. Sure, she could leave Wonderland, but Wonderland was never going to truly leave her ever again.\n\nByeeeeeeee\n\nPS: Really super duper fun links below!! The FUNNEST of links!

We're entering a time when the nightmares are now contagious viruses that spread from media to media and infect all our collective body cavities (anus). For example, for some reason that new emotional Ghostbusters trash was successful. People cried butterfly tears when they saw Venkman kiss Egon on the lips and rub his ghost trap and he ghost hugged his dumb daughter and told her he loved her even though she was clearly a lesbian and that secretly disappointed him even though he was a mute ghost. Well, that warranted a sequel of course. Then if that cash is flowing, green-light an animated series!!! Then green-light a live action series on Netflix or Prime or whatever. Might do a season or two. Who cares. People that work in the animation industry are starving and forced to deliver Amazon packages. 60% of them live on skid row or in tents outside of Dollar Generals. Nevertheless, studios are creating animated series based on any IP they can get their clawed hooves on and are using ghosts in Indonesia to animate them. Animated series about Twilight. Harry Potter. The Brady Bunch. Sabrina The Teenage Witch. Ronald McDonald and Friends. Punky Brewster. Se7en. Short Circuit The Harlem Globetrotters. Basic Instinct. Starship Troopers. Literally anything!!! They’d make an animated series about Twinkies if they could. Folks, we’ve gone beyond sequels and prequels and remakes. The nightmare is much worse. The virus is now mobile. It has left the theaters. It makes me wish Putin would invade the U.S. so I could spend my days in a foxhole waiting to get shot rather than reading stories about how there is going to be a Goonies reboot, live action series, and animated series all at once. Sometimes I just want to punch myself in the dick to feel something again. Too many shows. Too many streaming services. Too many monthly charges and most people have to work 3 jobs to make ends meet. Who has time to watch all this stuff? I mean, I do. I had an injury (anal-related) which forces me to sit in a wheel chair with a cut out hole in the seat for comfort. I can watch this garbage all day long. I supposed a lot of people who don’t work can watch streaming TV? The elderly. The disabled. But what does the everyday woman think when their zombie eyes sit down to watch a live action Pound Puppies™ series on Amazon Prime starring Jennifer Lopez and Jake Johnson as childless parents that adopt a CGI puppy. Or when a hard working man comes home from the construction site to put on the latest episode of the new live action Netflix He-Man™ Series that has a frustrating lack of homoeroticism. Or when their children forego homework to watch the new ALF™ animated series only to realize they are now dead inside. This content is like eating leftovers of leftovers. Three week old meats that we’ve cut the bad bits off of and hope we don't get emotionally ill. Eventually this will be the end of our civilization.",

After entering the Billboard Main chart and performing on a large-scale world tour, P1Harmony made their name as the chosen HERO (NEW KIDS) through 7th Mini Album.\n\nThe title track of the 7th Mini Album ‘SAD SONG’ is about emptiness and loneliness that came to P1Harmony, who became a HERO after saving the world and restoring peace. Going beyond the conventional perception of a hero as a solely grand figure, HERO, reinterpreted through P1Harmony’s unique perspective, conveys the power to overcome the universal emotion of sadness through dance and music.\n\nThis album's title 'SAD SONG' features a total of seven tracks, including the title track of the same name, along with other songs like the pop track 'It’s Alright,' which has an impressive reggae rhythm with electric guitar sounds, the energizing 'Last Call,' which brings vitality to the never-ending heat, the hopeful 'Welcome To,' encouraging the start of a new chapter, the medium-tempo track 'All You,' which is a confession of eternal love, the unit song 'WASP' by INTAK and JONGSEOB, which marks their first attempt at a unit track in P1Harmony, and even an English version of the title track 'SAD SONG.'\n\nP1Harmony, who has been steadily building their musical capabilities by actively participating in their previous projects, put a lot of effort into this 7th Mini Album 'SAD SONG' as well. KEEHO was deeply involved in, from the concept planning stage of the album, and even contributed to the composition of 'It’s Alright.'

            "description": "The Roller Coaster Capital of the World® will add fathoms of thrills to its world-renowned and record-breaking collection of scream machines with the 2025 debut of Siren’s Curse – the tallest, fastest and longest “tilt” roller coaster in North America. \n\nSiren’s Curse hearkens to the legend and lore of mysterious creatures living beneath the surface of Lake Erie; often spoken of – but never spotted. The sirens of the lake who lured sailors to their underwater demise with their sweet, seductive songs will finally rise to land and attempt to entrap guests in a sinister two-minute fate of non-stop roller coaster innovation.\n\nRiders will hear the echo of the siren’s chilling melodies as they ascend an old 160-foot-tall Lake Erie shipping crane tower, the sounds growing more sinister as riders reach the top. Their fate will hang in the balance as they encounter the roller coaster’s signature moment: a dead stop on a “broken off” section of track. The creaking platform holding the train of riders will slowly tilt the entire train into a 90-degree vertical position, forcing riders to peer straight down with the hope their train will connect to the twisted track below.\n\nAs the track locks into place, riders will flee from the beckoning call of the siren and plunge into the abyss, speeding through 2,966 feet of track at a top speed of 58 mph. The ride will feature 13 weightless airtime moments, two 360-degree, zero-gravity barrel rolls and a high-speed “triple-down” element with twisted and overbanked track.",

Starting with the Franchise hub, streamlined navigation gives players access to new, relevant, and easy-to-digest information, like box scores, player stats, an award tracker, an updated league ticker, and a goals and challenges display. \n\nPlus, you can now ask players to change their playstyle, which can lead to positive or negative effects, and set player goals. In an update to Chel’s contract offer overlay and Collective Bargaining Agreement, support for No Trade and No Movement clauses is now available for each contract year, with NTC and NMC icons that make it easy to keep track of each. New conversation functions enhance negotiations, making promises, waivers, and counters a faster, more intuitive process.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more NHL 25 Trailers: https://bit.ly/3kF5rTK\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsnhl\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsnhl \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/easportsnhl\n\n#NHL25 #Franchise"
