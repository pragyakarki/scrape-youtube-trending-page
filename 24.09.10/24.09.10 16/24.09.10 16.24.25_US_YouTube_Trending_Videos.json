Of simply loving and being loved. \n\nDoing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus. Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes.\n\nI am however looking forward to being back at work and undertaking a few more public engagements in the coming months when I can.\n\nDespite all that has gone before I enter this new phase of recovery with a renewed sense of hope and appreciation of life.\n\nWilliam and I are so grateful for the support we have received and have drawn great strength from all those who are helping us at this time.

He gives his takeaways after calling Texas’ blowout win over Michigan in the Big House and why he believes the Longhorns are a Tier 1 team in the sport now along with Georgia and Ohio State. He also details why he is very concerned about what he saw from the Wolverines on Saturday. Klatt discusses Nebraska’s win over Coach Prime and Colorado and what the result means for both programs. He praises the Lincoln faithful and Matt Rhule’s team before expressing his concern for Colorado this season. He then looks at the impact of Notre Dame’s upset loss on their Playoff chances and why this loss unraveled everything they gained with the Week 1 win over Texas A&M.

Thank you to Ritual for Sponsoring this video. Get 25% OFF your first month Go to https://ritual.com/eamonbec25 💕👌🏻\n\nEamon first proposed in February of 2017 while we were on a safari in Tanzania. It was easily one of the best days of our lives! Elephants, cheetahs and an engagement overlooking the Serengetti at sunset 🥰 . But, with so many exciting business ventures and travel ideas on our minds we made the decision to postpone the actually wedding until we were a little less busy. And then, we never stopped being really, really busy 😂 . Add in a global pandemic and a cancer diagnosis it just never felt like the right time. We're so excited to say that NOW actually feels like the RIGHT time!! We need your help!! Are you in the wedding industry in the areas of Ottawa, Kingston, or even Toronto? Do you have a food truck? Get in touch at our email -- hello@eamonandbec.com \n\nWe'd love to hear your ideas in the comments below! This is going to be one epic party 💜 \n\nThanks to our friends featured in this episode for being the absolute BEST. \n@MaxandOccy @kingingit \n\nRitual disclosure: *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Thank you to Ritual for Sponsoring this video. Get 25% OFF your first month Go to https://ritual.com/eamonbec25 💕👌🏻\n\nEamon first proposed in February of 2017 while we were on a safari in Tanzania. It was easily one of the best days of our lives! Elephants, cheetahs and an engagement overlooking the Serengetti at sunset 🥰 . But, with so many exciting business ventures and travel ideas on our minds we made the decision to postpone the actually wedding until we were a little less busy. And then, we never stopped being really, really busy 😂 . Add in a global pandemic and a cancer diagnosis it just never felt like the right time. We're so excited to say that NOW actually feels like the RIGHT time!! We need your help!! Are you in the wedding industry in the areas of Ottawa, Kingston, or even Toronto? Do you have a food truck? Get in touch at our email -- hello@eamonandbec.com \n\nWe'd love to hear your ideas in the comments below! This is going to be one epic party 💜 \n\nThanks to our friends featured in this episode for being the absolute BEST. \n@MaxandOccy @kingingit \n\nRitual disclosure: *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

            "description": "Learn to fly 2 is one of the greatest flash games ever. If you were to make a flash game tier list this is easily one of the best. Despite releasing in 2011 and flash player ending learn 2 fly is actually still an actively played game with a brilliant speedrunning community. \n\nOne of my favourite YouTubers EazySpeezy even managed to set a great speedrunning time in the game completing the entire thing on day 9. I however am the Spiffing Brit and whilst others play fair. I want to destroy the Ballance of every game I play. That is why today you will be watching a penguin go faster than the speed of sound. Faster than the speed of light and in fact faster than the game can even comprehend. \n\nI hope you all enjoy the show!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\n\nTitle: Can I Use Exploits To Beat Speedrunners? - Learn To Fly 2 IS PERFECTLY BALANCED\n\n#game #flashgame #speedrun",

                "description": "Learn to fly 2 is one of the greatest flash games ever. If you were to make a flash game tier list this is easily one of the best. Despite releasing in 2011 and flash player ending learn 2 fly is actually still an actively played game with a brilliant speedrunning community. \n\nOne of my favourite YouTubers EazySpeezy even managed to set a great speedrunning time in the game completing the entire thing on day 9. I however am the Spiffing Brit and whilst others play fair. I want to destroy the Ballance of every game I play. That is why today you will be watching a penguin go faster than the speed of sound. Faster than the speed of light and in fact faster than the game can even comprehend. \n\nI hope you all enjoy the show!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced gameplay series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold and infinite money all in a fantastic montage. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\n\nTitle: Can I Use Exploits To Beat Speedrunners? - Learn To Fly 2 IS PERFECTLY BALANCED\n\n#game #flashgame #speedrun"

It hasn’t always been easy, but standing here today, I know Alyssa and I are stronger than ever. She’s my world, and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with her. Together, we’ve faced every challenge, celebrated every victory, and built a relationship that’s unshakable. I’m beyond grateful to have her by my side, and while there’s still a long road ahead, I know that with Alyssa, every step is worth it.

            "description": "From the Director of The Invisible Man, #WolfManMovie is in theaters January.\n\n---\nWhat if someone you loved became something else? \n\nFrom Blumhouse and visionary writer-director Leigh Whannell, the creators of the chilling modern monster tale The Invisible Man, comes a terrifying new lupine nightmare: Wolf Man. \n\nGolden Globe nominee Christopher Abbott (Poor Things, It Comes at Night) stars as Blake, a San Francisco husband and father, who inherits his remote childhood home in rural Oregon after his own father vanishes and is presumed dead. With his marriage to his high-powered wife, Charlotte (Emmy winner Julia Garner; Ozark, Inventing Anna), fraying, Blake persuades Charlotte to take a break from the city and visit the property with their young daughter, Ginger (Matlida Firth; Hullraisers, Coma).\n\nBut as the family approaches the farmhouse in the dead of night, they’re attacked by an unseen animal and, in a desperate escape, barricade themselves inside the home as the creature prowls the perimeter. As the night stretches on, however, Blake begins to behave strangely, transforming into something unrecognizable, and Charlotte will be forced to decide whether the terror within their house is more lethal than the danger without. \n\nThe film co-stars Sam Jaeger (The Handmaid’s Tale), Ben Prendergast (The Sojourn Audio Drama) and Benedict Hardie (The Invisible Man). \n\nWolf Man is directed by Whannell, whose previous films with Blumhouse include The Invisible Man, Upgrade and Insidious: Chapter 3. The screenplay is written by Leigh Whannell & Corbett Tuck, Lauren Schuker Blum & Rebecca Angelo (Dumb Money). \n\nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and is executive produced by Ryan Gosling, Ken Kao, Bea Sequeira, Mel Turner and Leigh Whannell.

CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nFriday at 4:00pm ET\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously.

Her 2006 debut album’s first single, “Stars are Blind,” peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 and has accrued over 130M streams.

            "title": "Marlon Wayans' Hollywood Stories & Mo'Nique Saying The Wayans Bros Stole Her Joke In White Chicks",
            "description": "Marlon Wayans joins Shannon Sharpe at Club Shay Shay for an honest conversation about life, comedy, and family. Marlon, the youngest of the Wayans siblings, reflects on growing up as the \"butt\" of his family's jokes. He shares how his childhood was shaped by his mom's hands-on approach and his father's strict religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness. He talks about how his mom foresaw New York real estate's value skyrocketing and recounts wearing hand-me-downs from his brothers—a habit he's kept up even today.\n\nMarlon dives deep into his upbringing, recalling how different his family was from others in the neighborhood because they had both a mother and a father. He recounts having legendary entertainers like Eddie Murphy and Robert Townsend visit his home, and how he was writing sketches from a young age. Marlon also discusses the tension with his father over attending a performance arts high school and eventually leaving Howard University because of his experience with professors treating him differently due to In Living Color.\n\nHe opens up about his career in comedy, from his early auditions for his brother's movie Mo' Money to the creation of The Wayans Bros TV show with his brother Shawn. Marlon reflects on his family being labeled with nepotism despite their immense talent and discusses the challenges they faced with networks, including their decision to leave In Living Color when NBC attempted to blackball his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans. He gives credit to Keenen's talent-spotting abilities, noting how Keenen discovered major stars like Tommy Davidson, Jim Carrey, and Jennifer Lopez, and he reminisces about the legendary four-year run of In Living Color, which even led to the invention of the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nMarlon shares stories about his experiences in Hollywood, like working with Eddie Murphy on Norbit, his close friendship with Tupac Shakur during the filming of Above the Rim, and how the tragic deaths of Tupac and Biggie impacted him. He discusses the origins of The Wayans Bros show and remembers some of their best guests, including Bernie Mac, whom they helped elevate to stardom.\n\nHe gets into the complexities of Hollywood, discussing his family's challenges with the Weinstein brothers and how they were cheated out of a fair deal for the Scary Movie franchise. He reflects on the impact of being a visionary Black entertainer and the importance of coming together to create rather than tear each other down.\n\nMarlon talks about some of the iconic moments in his career, such as the making of White Chicks, which he describes as the hardest movie he's ever done. He responds to claims from Mo'Nique that White Chicks stole her baby powder joke, and addresses criticism about Black actors wearing dresses in Hollywood. He also shares his unique approach to comedy, stating that he doesn't write his jokes but performs spontaneously, \"like Jay-Z in the booth.\"\n\nIn a more personal segment, Marlon opens up about his relationship with his daughter and the difficulties of accepting her transition.

                "description": "Marlon Wayans joins Shannon Sharpe at Club Shay Shay for an honest conversation about life, comedy, and family. Marlon, the youngest of the Wayans siblings, reflects on growing up as the \"butt\" of his family's jokes. He shares how his childhood was shaped by his mom's hands-on approach and his father's strict religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness. He talks about how his mom foresaw New York real estate's value skyrocketing and recounts wearing hand-me-downs from his brothers—a habit he's kept up even today.\n\nMarlon dives deep into his upbringing, recalling how different his family was from others in the neighborhood because they had both a mother and a father. He recounts having legendary entertainers like Eddie Murphy and Robert Townsend visit his home, and how he was writing sketches from a young age. Marlon also discusses the tension with his father over attending a performance arts high school and eventually leaving Howard University because of his experience with professors treating him differently due to In Living Color.\n\nHe opens up about his career in comedy, from his early auditions for his brother's movie Mo' Money to the creation of The Wayans Bros TV show with his brother Shawn. Marlon reflects on his family being labeled with nepotism despite their immense talent and discusses the challenges they faced with networks, including their decision to leave In Living Color when NBC attempted to blackball his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans. He gives credit to Keenen's talent-spotting abilities, noting how Keenen discovered major stars like Tommy Davidson, Jim Carrey, and Jennifer Lopez, and he reminisces about the legendary four-year run of In Living Color, which even led to the invention of the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nMarlon shares stories about his experiences in Hollywood, like working with Eddie Murphy on Norbit, his close friendship with Tupac Shakur during the filming of Above the Rim, and how the tragic deaths of Tupac and Biggie impacted him. He discusses the origins of The Wayans Bros show and remembers some of their best guests, including Bernie Mac, whom they helped elevate to stardom.\n\nHe gets into the complexities of Hollywood, discussing his family's challenges with the Weinstein brothers and how they were cheated out of a fair deal for the Scary Movie franchise. He reflects on the impact of being a visionary Black entertainer and the importance of coming together to create rather than tear each other down.\n\nMarlon talks about some of the iconic moments in his career, such as the making of White Chicks, which he describes as the hardest movie he's ever done. He responds to claims from Mo'Nique that White Chicks stole her baby powder joke, and addresses criticism about Black actors wearing dresses in Hollywood.

                "description": "Watch live as Boeing's Starliner spacecraft departs from the International Space Station for a landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. The uncrewed spacecraft is scheduled to autonomously undock from the station at approximately 6:04 p.m. EDT (2204 UTC) Friday, Sept. 6, to begin the journey home, weather conditions permitting.\n \nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on June 5 for its first crewed flight, arriving at the space station on June 6. As Starliner approached the orbiting laboratory, NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft reaction control thrusters. For the safety of the astronauts, NASA announced on Aug. 24 that Starliner will return to Earth from the station without a crew. Wilmore and Williams will remain aboard the station and return home in February 2025 aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members assigned to NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission.\n \nLearn more about Starliner's return to Earth: https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-sets-coverage-for-starliner-news-conference-return-to-earth/\nLearn more about the Commercial Crew Program: https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/commercial-crew-program/\n \nCredit: NASA\n \n#NASA #Starliner #Boeing #SpaceStation #Spacecraft"

Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West. \n \nThe film also stars Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n \nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots), and a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman). \n \nDirected by acclaimed filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 26, 2025.\n \nWicked is produced by Marc Platt (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar® nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are David Nicksay, Stephen Schwartz and Jared LeBoff. \n \nBased on the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked is adapted for the screen by the stage production’s book writer Winnie Holzman and by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The Broadway stage musical is produced by Universal Stage Productions, Marc Platt, the Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone.",

Built on an all-new logic-driven animation system, ICE-Q responds to contextual events on the ice with unprecedented authenticity and is the foundation of Chel’s gameplay overhaul.\n\nNext-Gen Vision Control provides fresh abilities, improvements, and a user-initiated skating mode that ups the responsiveness, explosiveness, and expression on the ice for human and AI players alike. A completely overhauled AI player system heightens CPU skaters’ awareness of other players and positioning on the ice. Plus, a refreshed playbook improves power plays, 5-on-5 offensive plays.\n\nReactive Actions reward players for proper on-ice positioning, increase collision avoidance, and offer authentic visual reactions for players to recognize and take advantage of in those high-action moments.\n\nSkill Based One-Timers create authentic gameplay tension as offensive excitement and expectation mix with defensive concern and anticipation, each pass creating unique moments and opportunities for high-scoring probability shots.\n\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more NHL 25 Trailers: https://bit.ly/3kF5rTK\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsnhl\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsnhl \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/easportsnhl\n\n#NHL25 #Gameplay",

Built on an all-new logic-driven animation system, ICE-Q responds to contextual events on the ice with unprecedented authenticity and is the foundation of Chel’s gameplay overhaul.\n\nNext-Gen Vision Control provides fresh abilities, improvements, and a user-initiated skating mode that ups the responsiveness, explosiveness, and expression on the ice for human and AI players alike. A completely overhauled AI player system heightens CPU skaters’ awareness of other players and positioning on the ice. Plus, a refreshed playbook improves power plays, 5-on-5 offensive plays.\n\nReactive Actions reward players for proper on-ice positioning, increase collision avoidance, and offer authentic visual reactions for players to recognize and take advantage of in those high-action moments.\n\nSkill Based One-Timers create authentic gameplay tension as offensive excitement and expectation mix with defensive concern and anticipation, each pass creating unique moments and opportunities for high-scoring probability shots.\n\n\nSubscribe on YouTube for more NHL 25 Trailers: https://bit.ly/3kF5rTK\n\nFollow for official news  \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@easportsnhl\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/easportsnhl \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/easportsnhl\n\n#NHL25 #Gameplay"
