            "title": "Texas blows out Michigan, Nebraska gets revenge on Colorado and Notre Dame throws last week away",
            "description": "Fox Sports’ lead College Football analyst Joel Klatt reacts to a wild 2nd week of the college football season that saw a major upset and several top teams narrowly escape the same fate. He gives his takeaways after calling Texas’ blowout win over Michigan in the Big House and why he believes the Longhorns are a Tier 1 team in the sport now along with Georgia and Ohio State. He also details why he is very concerned about what he saw from the Wolverines on Saturday. Klatt discusses Nebraska’s win over Coach Prime and Colorado and what the result means for both programs.

                "description": "Fox Sports’ lead College Football analyst Joel Klatt reacts to a wild 2nd week of the college football season that saw a major upset and several top teams narrowly escape the same fate. He gives his takeaways after calling Texas’ blowout win over Michigan in the Big House and why he believes the Longhorns are a Tier 1 team in the sport now along with Georgia and Ohio State. He also details why he is very concerned about what he saw from the Wolverines on Saturday. Klatt discusses Nebraska’s win over Coach Prime and Colorado and what the result means for both programs. He praises the Lincoln faithful and Matt Rhule’s team before expressing his concern for Colorado this season. He then looks at the impact of Notre Dame’s upset loss on their Playoff chances and why this loss unraveled everything they gained with the Week 1 win over Texas A&M.

This video took a lot of time and effort to put together, so I'd really appreciate it if you shared this with a friend. If you have any suggestions for the next video, leave it in the comments below! Have a great day :)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFollow me on Twitch!\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/johnstone\n\nFollow me on Twitter!\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnstoneYT\n\nFollow my Twitch VODs Channel!\n@johnstonevods \n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:29 - The Starters\n5:47 - The Odd Egg Duel\n10:15 - The Elekid Hunt\n13:45 - 3DS Hunts\n19:20 - 40 Shinies\n24:04 - 50 Shinies\n33:37 - 60 Shinies\n35:40 - 70 Shinies\n42:31 -  80 Shinies\n45:11 - 90 Shinies\n49:14 - The Final Shiny Hunts\n51:28 - Hunting Celebi"

            "description": "From the Director of The Invisible Man, #WolfManMovie is in theaters January.\n\n---\nWhat if someone you loved became something else? \n\nFrom Blumhouse and visionary writer-director Leigh Whannell, the creators of the chilling modern monster tale The Invisible Man, comes a terrifying new lupine nightmare: Wolf Man. \n\nGolden Globe nominee Christopher Abbott (Poor Things, It Comes at Night) stars as Blake, a San Francisco husband and father, who inherits his remote childhood home in rural Oregon after his own father vanishes and is presumed dead. With his marriage to his high-powered wife, Charlotte (Emmy winner Julia Garner; Ozark, Inventing Anna), fraying, Blake persuades Charlotte to take a break from the city and visit the property with their young daughter, Ginger (Matlida Firth; Hullraisers, Coma).\n\nBut as the family approaches the farmhouse in the dead of night, they’re attacked by an unseen animal and, in a desperate escape, barricade themselves inside the home as the creature prowls the perimeter. As the night stretches on, however, Blake begins to behave strangely, transforming into something unrecognizable, and Charlotte will be forced to decide whether the terror within their house is more lethal than the danger without. \n\nThe film co-stars Sam Jaeger (The Handmaid’s Tale), Ben Prendergast (The Sojourn Audio Drama) and Benedict Hardie (The Invisible Man). \n\nWolf Man is directed by Whannell, whose previous films with Blumhouse include The Invisible Man, Upgrade and Insidious: Chapter 3. The screenplay is written by Leigh Whannell & Corbett Tuck, Lauren Schuker Blum & Rebecca Angelo (Dumb Money). \n\nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and is executive produced by Ryan Gosling, Ken Kao, Bea Sequeira, Mel Turner and Leigh Whannell. Wolf Man is a Blumhouse and Motel Movies production. \n\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/WolfManMovie/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wolfmanmovie/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/universalpictures\nX: https://x.com/WolfManMovie25\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\nWebsite: https://www.wolfmanmovie.com",

I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!\n\nDon't forget to check out the Poopy plush!! \nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nWhat I'm Using (contains affiliate links):\nSquishy Makeovers Fixing Your Squishies #37\nTulip Matte Fabric Paint: https://amzn.to/49OjdMp\nTulip Slick Fabric Paint: https://amzn.to/3LBW6uO\nPosca Pens: https://amzn.to/40TgXPL\nScissors: https://amzn.to/3MjSY6L\nSandpaper: https://amzn.to/3EQOOPY\nFabric Hot Glue: https://amzn.to/3PQ4KZh\n\n\n_______FAQs________\n\n1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?\nSo many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.\n\n2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?\nNo. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they are damaged and/or no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. \n\n3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?\nI use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.\n\n5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?\nThe matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.\n\n6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?\nI would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily.\n\n\n___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___\n\nFriday at 4:00pm ET\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\n\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously.

I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes. \n\nCURRENT SERIES:\nSquishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers\nThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales\nBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life\nCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)\nSquishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers\nDrawings to Squishies: turning my flat drawings into squishies\nFinishing Art Ideas: Choosing art ideas from my giant list and making them happen\nSquishies I've Been Avoiding: Painting on the squishies I DON'T want to paint\n\n\nFind Products I Use (contains affiliate links):\nhttps://a.co/4XDtrmV\n\n\n____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 3:\nhttps://amzn.to/3OQpfEJ\n\nME Merchandise:\nhttps://moriahelizabethmerch.com/\n\nOfficial Amazon Store:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/MoriahElizabeth/page/84A1B7AA-51AC-4B6B-AD8D-A20CCD5FCB47?ref_=ast_bln\n\nME Nail Polish\nslatebrands.com/menails\n\n\n____ME SOCIALS____\n\nINSTAGRAM: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/\n\nTIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627\n\nSNAPCHAT:\nMoriahOfficial\n\nVISIT ME WEBSITE:\nhttps://www.moriahelizabeth.com/\n\n\n____CONTACT ME____\n\nFOR GENERAL QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS:\nFanmail@Moriah.Video\n\nFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:\nmoriah@nightmedia.co\n\n\n_____MAIL ME_____\n\nFor sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address \n(must be 13+ to send mail)\nATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only give out my address to a small amount of people each week.

An autobiographical record, \"Infinite Icon\" shares Hilton’s full story, from pop high priestess to media maven to mother.\n\nHilton is no stranger to the top of the music charts. Her 2006 debut album’s first single, “Stars are Blind,” peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 and has accrued over 130M streams.

            "description": "Watch live as Boeing's Starliner spacecraft departs from the International Space Station for a landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. The uncrewed spacecraft is scheduled to autonomously undock from the station at approximately 6:04 p.m. EDT (2204 UTC) Friday, Sept. 6, to begin the journey home, weather conditions permitting.\n \nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on June 5 for its first crewed flight, arriving at the space station on June 6. As Starliner approached the orbiting laboratory, NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft reaction control thrusters. For the safety of the astronauts, NASA announced on Aug. 24 that Starliner will return to Earth from the station without a crew. Wilmore and Williams will remain aboard the station and return home in February 2025 aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members assigned to NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission.\n \nLearn more about Starliner's return to Earth: https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-sets-coverage-for-starliner-news-conference-return-to-earth/\nLearn more about the Commercial Crew Program: https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/commercial-crew-program/\n \nCredit: NASA\n \n#NASA #Starliner #Boeing #SpaceStation #Spacecraft",

            "description": "Marlon Wayans joins Shannon Sharpe at Club Shay Shay for an honest conversation about life, comedy, and family. Marlon, the youngest of the Wayans siblings, reflects on growing up as the \"butt\" of his family's jokes. He shares how his childhood was shaped by his mom's hands-on approach and his father's strict religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness. He talks about how his mom foresaw New York real estate's value skyrocketing and recounts wearing hand-me-downs from his brothers—a habit he's kept up even today.\n\nMarlon dives deep into his upbringing, recalling how different his family was from others in the neighborhood because they had both a mother and a father. He recounts having legendary entertainers like Eddie Murphy and Robert Townsend visit his home, and how he was writing sketches from a young age. Marlon also discusses the tension with his father over attending a performance arts high school and eventually leaving Howard University because of his experience with professors treating him differently due to In Living Color.\n\nHe opens up about his career in comedy, from his early auditions for his brother's movie Mo' Money to the creation of The Wayans Bros TV show with his brother Shawn. Marlon reflects on his family being labeled with nepotism despite their immense talent and discusses the challenges they faced with networks, including their decision to leave In Living Color when NBC attempted to blackball his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans. He gives credit to Keenen's talent-spotting abilities, noting how Keenen discovered major stars like Tommy Davidson, Jim Carrey, and Jennifer Lopez, and he reminisces about the legendary four-year run of In Living Color, which even led to the invention of the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nMarlon shares stories about his experiences in Hollywood, like working with Eddie Murphy on Norbit, his close friendship with Tupac Shakur during the filming of Above the Rim, and how the tragic deaths of Tupac and Biggie impacted him. He discusses the origins of The Wayans Bros show and remembers some of their best guests, including Bernie Mac, whom they helped elevate to stardom.\n\nHe gets into the complexities of Hollywood, discussing his family's challenges with the Weinstein brothers and how they were cheated out of a fair deal for the Scary Movie franchise. He reflects on the impact of being a visionary Black entertainer and the importance of coming together to create rather than tear each other down.\n\nMarlon talks about some of the iconic moments in his career, such as the making of White Chicks, which he describes as the hardest movie he's ever done. He responds to claims from Mo'Nique that White Chicks stole her baby powder joke, and addresses criticism about Black actors wearing dresses in Hollywood. He also shares his unique approach to comedy, stating that he doesn't write his jokes but performs spontaneously, \"like Jay-Z in the booth.\"\n\nIn a more personal segment, Marlon opens up about his relationship with his daughter and the difficulties of accepting her transition. He discusses his desire to have another child in his 50s, his reluctance to get married, and how he plans to be a different father this time around.\n\nTune in to this episode of Club Shay Shay for a raw and insightful conversation with Marlon Wayans, filled with laughter, love, and some unexpected revelations.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #marlonwayans #wayansbros \n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

He discusses his desire to have another child in his 50s, his reluctance to get married, and how he plans to be a different father this time around.\n\nTune in to this episode of Club Shay Shay for a raw and insightful conversation with Marlon Wayans, filled with laughter, love, and some unexpected revelations.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #marlonwayans #wayansbros \n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

            "description": "The magical world of Oz, where you can expect the unexpected. Watch the new #WickedMovie trailer now.\n-----\nSubscribe to the Wicked YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/wickedmovie\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/wickedmovie\nX: https://twitter.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/wickedmovie/\nOfficial Site:  https://www.wickedmovie.com/\n\nAfter two decades as one of the most beloved and enduring musicals on the stage, Wicked makes its long-awaited journey to the big screen as a spectacular, generation-defining cinematic event this holiday season. \n\nWicked, the untold story of the witches of Oz, stars Emmy, Grammy and Tony winning powerhouse Cynthia Erivo (Harriet, Broadway’s The Color Purple) as Elphaba, a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power, and Grammy-winning, multi-platinum recording artist and global superstar Ariana Grande as Glinda, a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart. \n \nThe two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West. \n \nThe film also stars Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n \nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots), and a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman). \n \nDirected by acclaimed filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 26, 2025.\n \nWicked is produced by Marc Platt (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar® nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are David Nicksay, Stephen Schwartz and Jared LeBoff. \n \nBased on the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked is adapted for the screen by the stage production’s book writer Winnie Holzman and by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The Broadway stage musical is produced by Universal Stage Productions, Marc Platt, the Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone.",

                "description": "The magical world of Oz, where you can expect the unexpected. Watch the new #WickedMovie trailer now.\n-----\nSubscribe to the Wicked YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/wickedmovie\nTikTok:  https://www.tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/wickedmovie\nX: https://twitter.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/wickedmovie/\nOfficial Site:  https://www.wickedmovie.com/\n\nAfter two decades as one of the most beloved and enduring musicals on the stage, Wicked makes its long-awaited journey to the big screen as a spectacular, generation-defining cinematic event this holiday season. \n\nWicked, the untold story of the witches of Oz, stars Emmy, Grammy and Tony winning powerhouse Cynthia Erivo (Harriet, Broadway’s The Color Purple) as Elphaba, a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power, and Grammy-winning, multi-platinum recording artist and global superstar Ariana Grande as Glinda, a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart. \n \nThe two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West. \n \nThe film also stars Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh as Shiz University’s regal headmistress Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey (Bridgerton, Fellow Travelers) as Fiyero, a roguish and carefree prince; Tony nominee Ethan Slater (Broadway’s Spongebob Squarepants, Fosse/Verdon) as Boq, an altruistic Munchkin student; Marissa Bode in her feature-film debut as Nessarose, Elphaba’s favored sister; and pop culture icon Jeff Goldblum as the legendary Wizard of Oz.\n \nThe cast of characters includes Pfannee and ShenShen, two conniving compatriots of Glinda played by Emmy nominee Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live) and Bronwyn James (Harlots), and a new character created for the film, Miss Coddle, played by Tony nominee Keala Settle (The Greatest Showman). \n \nDirected by acclaimed filmmaker Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights), Wicked is the first chapter of a two-part immersive, cultural celebration. Wicked Part Two is scheduled to arrive in theaters on November 26, 2025.\n \nWicked is produced by Marc Platt (La La Land, The Little Mermaid), whose films, television shows and stage productions have earned a combined 46 Oscar® nominations, 58 Emmy nominations and 36 Tony nominations, and by multiple Tony winner David Stone (Kimberly Akimbo, Next to Normal), with whom Platt produced the blockbuster Wicked stage musical. The executive producers are David Nicksay, Stephen Schwartz and Jared LeBoff. \n \nBased on the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire, Wicked is adapted for the screen by the stage production’s book writer Winnie Holzman and by legendary Grammy and Oscar® winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz. The Broadway stage musical is produced by Universal Stage Productions, Marc Platt, the Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone."

Torn between them is socialite Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), the mayor's daughter, whose love for Cesar has divided her loyalties, forcing her to discover what she truly believes humanity deserves.",

Together, they designed a farmhouse-style oasis full of warmth and character. From her wooden kitchen with a dedicated baking station to an orchard in the backyard, it’s easy to forget Garner lives among the hustle and bustle of LA. “I wanted it to feel old and cool and historic, but I also wanted to make it work for a big family with a lot of things going on.”\r\n\r\nSee more of Jennifer Garner's home here: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/step-inside-jennifer-garners-cozy-california-home\r\n\r\nShop pieces inspired by Jennifer Garner’s Cozy California Home: https://www.architecturaldigest.com/shopping/jennifer-garner-open-door\r\n\r\n00:00 Intro\r\n00:17 Living Room\r\n02:00 Kitchen\r\n03:09 Dining Room\r\n03:50 Library\r\n04:54 Orchard\r\n05:56 Vegetable House\r\n06:17 Pool Area\r\n06:53 Landing\r\n07:20 Reading Nook\r\n07:59 Primary Bedroom\r\n08:41 Primary Bathroom\r\n09:21 Slumber Party Room\r\n\r\n'Formia’ stone sculpture by Ole Mynster at Ruby Atelier\r\nPhotography by Lara Porzak\r\nStained Glass by Judson Studios, Reed Bradley\r\n\n\nWant even more AD?

The game features a variety of alien characters, each with different abilities such as robot legs for high jumps and diamond skin for enhanced damage absorption. One of the groups within the game is known as the Freegunners, who are mercenaries. Some of the game mechanics include special equipment like healing pads and trip mines, which persist not only between deaths but also across rounds. Five playable characters unveiled are: Vale, Haymar, Star Child, Lennox, and the robot 1-Off. At launch, the game will feature 16 characters. The game will also have free post-launch updates that will add more characters, maps, vignettes, and more. Every week, the game will feature new vignettes that will show what Concord‘s characters are up to outside of gameplay in the Concord galaxy. The vignettes will tell an ongoing story, with characters receiving their own narrative arcs.\n~ Wikipedia\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n╔═╦╗╔╦╗╔═╦═╦╦╦╦╗╔═╗\n║╚╣║║║╚╣╚╣╔╣╔╣║╚╣═╣ \n╠╗║╚╝║║╠╗║╚╣║║║║║═╣\n╚═╩══╩═╩═╩═╩╝╚╩═╩═╝\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe and I'll be your bestest friend!\n#gaming #ps5 #playstation",
