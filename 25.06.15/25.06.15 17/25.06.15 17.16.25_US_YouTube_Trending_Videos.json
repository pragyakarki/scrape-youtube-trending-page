Start your language journey today at https://partners.rosettastone.com/safiyanygaard for an exclusive discount of over 60% off an unlimited lifetime language subscription!! 🍡\n\n#rosettastone #rosettastonepartner \n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! And welcome to the 7-Eleven haul of my dreams!! Now, on our previous trips to East Asia, we definitely noticed the prevalence of 7-Elevens pretty much everywhere - and not only were we surprised by how widespread and popular they were - we quickly realized, they had a lot of pretty awesome stuff we don’t have in the states - like, baos, teas, sandos, noodles, iced coffees, unique chip flavors, pancake sandwiches, corn ice cream - and more!! And once we returned - I started to notice how many people online were also going to international 7-Elevens and doing snack hauls - and I realized - this is a convenience store movement!! \n\nSo on our travels over the past year, we’ve collected 7-Eleven tours and hauls in each country we visited - Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan… to try out some viral snacks, and generally compare them, but also mostly just to feast! Which country’s 7-Eleven should we visit next? \n\nAlso, there is some controversy around birds nest products that we weren't aware of before filming, our apologies. If you'd like to know more, here are a couple of links to some more information -\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/birds-nest-delicacy-asia-price-farming-benefits-2021-3\nhttps://tableagent.com/article/birds-nest-soup-savory-delicacy-or-gourmet-cruelty/\nhttps://naturalnest.com/blogs/news/ethics-of-harvesting-bird-nests-the-what-you-need-to-know?srsltid=AfmBOorW9H0KXEyJVxYXWB6E-6dxs2C64u3zRrl0MTJ3y9cYnDNyG5M4\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@tylerwilliams \nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/@safiyashorts\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nExecutive Producers: Safiya Nygaard & Tyler Williams\nManaging Producer: Lona Smith\nAssociate Producer: Ishara Mathews\nEditor: Andrew Lainhart\nEditor: Malcolm McLean\nJunior Editor: Leslie Alcantar\nAssistant Editor: Max Winiarski\nGraphic Designer: Dayana Espinoza\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\n00:00 Intro\n03:32 Singaporean 7-Eleven (& 7-Cafe)\n07:01 Singapore 7-Eleven Taste Test\n11:10 The Largest 7-Eleven in Malaysia\n16:00 Malaysia 7-Eleven Taste Test\n19:29 The Big Daddy: Japanese 7-Eleven\n23:49 Japan 7-Eleven Taste Test\n27:57 Final Rankings\n\n#vlog #food #foodie #snacks #7eleven",

En nuestros viajes anteriores al Este de Asia, notamos la abundancia de 7-Elevens en casi todas partes. No solo nos sorprendió su popularidad, sino que enseguida nos dimos cuenta de que tenían muchísimas cosas increíbles que no tenemos en Estados Unidos, como baos, tés, sándwiches, fideos, café helado, sabores únicos de papas fritas, sándwiches de panqueques, helado de maíz, ¡y mucho más! Y al regresar, empecé a notar cuánta gente en línea también iba a 7-Elevens internacionales y compraba bocadillos, y me di cuenta de que ¡esto es un fenómeno de tiendas de conveniencia!\n\nAsí que, durante nuestros viajes del último año, recopilamos tours y compras de 7-Eleven en cada país que visitamos: Singapur, Malasia y Japón… para probar algunos snacks virales y compararlos, ¡pero también para darnos un festín! ¿Qué 7-Eleven de qué país deberíamos visitar próximamente?\n\nAdemás, hay cierta controversia sobre los productos de nido de pájaro que desconocíamos antes de grabar.

Und willkommen zum 7-Eleven-Einkauf meiner Träume! Auf unseren vorherigen Reisen nach Ostasien fiel uns die große Präsenz von 7-Eleven-Läden auf – und wir waren nicht nur überrascht, wie weit verbreitet und beliebt sie waren, sondern merkten auch schnell, dass sie viele tolle Sachen hatten, die es in den USA nicht gibt – wie Baos, Tees, Sandos, Nudeln, Eiskaffee, einzigartige Chipssorten, Pfannkuchen-Sandwiches, Maiseis – und vieles mehr! Und als wir zurückkamen, fiel mir auf, wie viele Leute online auch internationale 7-Eleven-Läden besuchten und Snacks kauften – und mir wurde klar: Das ist eine Convenience-Store-Bewegung!\n\nAuf unseren Reisen im letzten Jahr haben wir 7-Eleven-Touren und -Besuche in jedem unserer Länder – Singapur, Malaysia und Japan – gesammelt, um ein paar virale Snacks zu probieren und sie generell zu vergleichen, aber vor allem auch einfach nur, um zu schlemmen! Welchen 7-Eleven in welchem ​​Land sollten wir als Nächstes besuchen?\n\nAußerdem gibt es eine Kontroverse um Vogelnestprodukte, von der wir vor den Dreharbeiten nichts wussten.

A kiedy wróciliśmy - zacząłem zauważać, jak wiele osób online również chodzi do międzynarodowych 7-Eleven i robi przekąski - i zdałem sobie sprawę - to jest ruch sklepów typu convenience store!!\n\nWięc podczas naszych podróży w ciągu ostatniego roku zebraliśmy wycieczki i zakupy 7-Eleven w każdym kraju, który odwiedziliśmy - Singapurze, Malezji i Japonii... aby wypróbować kilka popularnych przekąsek i ogólnie je porównać, ale także głównie po to, aby ucztować!

Et bienvenue dans le 7-Eleven de mes rêves ! Lors de nos précédents voyages en Asie de l'Est, nous avions constaté la présence des 7-Eleven un peu partout. Non seulement nous avons été surpris par leur popularité, mais nous avons vite réalisé qu'ils proposaient plein de produits vraiment géniaux que nous n'avons pas aux États-Unis : baos, thés, sandos, nouilles, cafés glacés, chips aux saveurs uniques, pancakes, glaces au maïs, et bien plus encore ! À notre retour, j'ai remarqué que de nombreux internautes fréquentaient également les 7-Eleven internationaux pour faire leurs courses de snacks. J'ai alors réalisé qu'il s'agissait d'un mouvement de proximité !\n\nAu cours de nos voyages de l'année dernière, nous avons rassemblé des circuits et des hauls 7-Eleven dans chaque pays que nous avons visité : Singapour, la Malaisie et le Japon… pour tester des en-cas devenus virals et les comparer, mais aussi et surtout pour nous régaler ! Quel pays 7-Eleven devrions-nous visiter ensuite ?\n\nDe plus, il existe une controverse autour des produits à base de nids d'oiseaux dont nous n'avions pas connaissance avant le tournage, veuillez nous en excuser.

Dan selamat datang di 7-Eleven impian saya!! Nah, pada perjalanan kami sebelumnya ke Asia Timur, kami benar-benar memperhatikan banyaknya 7-Eleven di mana-mana - dan kami tidak hanya terkejut dengan seberapa luas dan populernya mereka - kami segera menyadari, mereka memiliki banyak barang yang sangat mengagumkan yang tidak kami miliki di Amerika Serikat - seperti, bao, teh, sando, mi, es kopi, rasa keripik yang unik, sandwich panekuk, es krim jagung - dan banyak lagi!! Dan begitu kami kembali - saya mulai memperhatikan berapa banyak orang daring yang juga pergi ke 7-Eleven internasional dan melakukan pembelian makanan ringan - dan saya menyadari - ini adalah gerakan toko serba ada!!\n\nJadi dalam perjalanan kami selama setahun terakhir, kami telah mengumpulkan tur dan belanja 7-Eleven di setiap negara yang kami kunjungi - Singapura, Malaysia, dan Jepang… untuk mencoba beberapa camilan viral, dan membandingkannya secara umum, tetapi juga sebagian besar hanya untuk berpesta! 7-Eleven negara mana yang harus kami kunjungi selanjutnya? \n\nSelain itu, ada beberapa kontroversi seputar produk sarang burung yang tidak kami ketahui sebelum merekam, kami mohon maaf.

E benvenuti al viaggio da 7-Eleven dei miei sogni!! Ora, nei nostri precedenti viaggi in Asia orientale, abbiamo sicuramente notato la presenza di 7-Eleven praticamente ovunque - e non solo siamo rimasti sorpresi dalla loro diffusione e popolarità - ma ci siamo subito resi conto che avevano un sacco di cose fantastiche che non abbiamo negli Stati Uniti - come bao, tè, sando, noodles, caffè freddo, patatine dai gusti unici, panini con pancake, gelato al mais - e molto altro!! E una volta tornati, ho iniziato a notare quante persone online andavano anche nei 7-Eleven internazionali e facevano viaggi di snack - e ho capito: questo è un movimento da minimarket!!\n\nQuindi, durante i nostri viaggi dell'ultimo anno, abbiamo raccolto tour e haul di 7-Eleven in ogni paese che abbiamo visitato: Singapore, Malesia e Giappone... per provare alcuni snack virali e, in generale, confrontarli, ma anche e soprattutto per fare un piccolo assaggio!

            "description": "On July 11, the entire world will look up. Get tickets now for #Superman - Only In Theaters and @IMAX \n\n“Superman,” DC Studios’ first feature film to hit the big screen, is set to soar into theaters worldwide this summer from Warner Bros. Pictures.  In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind. \n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with composer David Fleming (“The Last of Us”) and editors William Hoy (“The Batman”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).  \n\nDC Studios Presents a Troll Court Entertainment/The Safran Company Production, A James Gunn Film, “Superman,” which will be in theaters and IMAX® nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialAudio",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialAudio"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Nous avons même construit un engin Rube Goldberg pour mon chaton Nori afin qu'il puisse lui donner des friandises au passage du train ! Dans cet épisode riche en aventures, nous nous rendons également sur une voie ferrée abandonnée pour en apprendre davantage sur les trains dans le monde réel !\n\nCe voyage en train LEGO comprendra 5 arrêts exceptionnels, dont une double serre remplie de plantes vivantes et de plantes LEGO, une montagne enneigée avec des sapins de Noël miniatures et le Père Noël LEGO, un café à chats, un tunnel phosphorescent orné de cristaux lumineux et un écosystème désertique aride avec des animaux LEGO et de vrais cactus. Le train LEGO sera équipé d'une minuscule caméra pour que vous puissiez voir ce qu'il voit. Alors, soyez attentifs aux constructions LEGO cachées tout au long du trajet !
