            "title": "Structures Burn as Palisades Fire Explodes to 1,200+ Acres",
            "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

                "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

                "description": "Un mio cliente mi ha chiesto di dare un'occhiata alla sua Toyota Tundra del 2020 che ha un problema di avviamento e spegnimento dopo che il motore è stato in funzione per più di qualche minuto. Il camion si avvia e funziona bene per tutto il giorno, finché non lo spegni. Dopodiché devi spruzzarlo con del liquido di avviamento o aspettare che si raffreddi per riavviarlo. Dopo alcuni test il problema era ovvio, quindi l'ha portata al concessionario Toyota locale per farla riparare in garanzia. Tuttavia, gli hanno comunicato che la mia diagnosi è sbagliata e che deve pagare il pezzo perché non è in garanzia. Questo è esattamente il problema che stava cercando di evitare. Vediamo come va a finire per il mio cliente.\n-Buon divertimento!\n\nSe un video SMA ti è stato utile, prendi in considerazione di donare tramite \"Patreon\" per aiutarci a sostenerci.

                "description": "A customer of mine asked me to look at his 2020 Toyota Tundra that has an issue starting and stalling after the engine has been running for more than a few minutes. The truck will start and run fine all day long, until you shut it off. After that you either need to spray it with starting fluid or wait until it cools off to restart. After a few tests the problem was obvious so he took it to the local Toyota dealer to have it fixed under warranty. However they informed  him my diagnosis is wrong and he needs to pay for the part because it is not under warranty. This is the exact issue he was trying to avoid. Let's see how this ends up for my customer.\n-Enjoy!\n\n1/7/25 UPDATE - SEE PINNED COMMENT IN VIDEO\n\nIf an SMA Video has helped you out, please consider giving using \"Patreon\" to help support us.

                "description": "Einer meiner Kunden bat mich, mir seinen 2020er Toyota Tundra anzusehen, der ein Startproblem hat und nach einigen Minuten Motorlaufzeit ausgeht. Der Truck springt an und läuft den ganzen Tag lang einwandfrei, bis Sie ihn abstellen. Danach müssen Sie ihn entweder mit Starthilfespray besprühen oder warten, bis er abgekühlt ist, um ihn wieder zu starten. Nach einigen Tests war das Problem offensichtlich, also brachte er ihn zum örtlichen Toyota-Händler, um ihn im Rahmen der Garantie reparieren zu lassen. Dort teilten sie ihm jedoch mit, dass meine Diagnose falsch sei und er das Teil bezahlen müsse, da es nicht unter die Garantie falle. Genau das wollte er vermeiden. Mal sehen, wie das für meinen Kunden ausgeht.\n- Viel Spaß!\n\nWenn Ihnen ein SMA-Video geholfen hat, denken Sie bitte darüber nach, uns mit „Patreon“ zu unterstützen.

            "description": "A significant winter storm is approaching Texas, bringing snow, ice, and rain. Our journey will begin with snow in the Borderland region of Far West Texas near El Paso around lunchtime on Wednesday. The snowfall will spread into the Trans-Pecos, Davis Mountains, and Guadalupe Mountains during the afternoon and evening.\n\nWidespread precipitation is expected to commence Thursday morning, moving east across Texas. The freezing line on Thursday morning is projected to be in the northern Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, Central Texas, and the northern parts of East Texas. In areas where surface temperatures are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, ice and snow accumulations may occur.\n \nAs Thursday progresses into the afternoon and evening, the freezing line will shift northward, bringing the previously mentioned regions above freezing and changing precipitation from snow to rain. The Concho Valley, Big Country, Northwest Texas, the Panhandle, West Texas, Texoma, North Texas (north of D/FW), and Northeast Texas are likely to stay in the 'snow zone' for the majority of the storm, continuing into Thursday night and Friday morning.\n \nSignificant snow accumulation is anticipated, particularly across Texoma, northern D/FW, and Northeast Texas. Hazardous travel conditions are expected, especially on untreated and unplowed roads. The winter storm is expected to taper off around lunchtime on Friday as the activity moves eastward out of Texas. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoIfgmxArIATc2EpHD3W9EA/join\n\nCheck out our current LIVE STREAM: https://texasweather.video/\nOur FREE WEATHER APP: https://texasweather.app/\nOur WEBSITE/RADAR: https://texasstormchasers.com/radar\nOur SOCIAL PLATFORMS: https://linktr.ee/texasstormchasers\nDonations - Paypal@texasstormchasers.com\n *Enable 4K 60FPS when possible for best viewing results*\n\nVIDEO CHAPTERS:\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:54 - Today through Wednesday Morning (HRRR)\n1:42 - Snow Forecast: Wednesday through Friday (NAM)\n5:42 - Snow Accumulation Forecast Maps\n8:41 - Ice Accumulation Forecast Map\n10:27 - Forecast Five-Day Rain Totals\n11:44 - Long-Range Weather Forecast (GFS)\n12:40 - Five-Day Temperature Forecast\n15:57 - Conclusion & Baldyinchiefisms\n\n#texas #texasweather #weather #abilene #alpine #amarillo #austin #beaumont #beeville #bigbend #brownsville #brownwood #canadian #childress #collegestation #coriscana #corpuschristi #crashythecoldfront #dalhart #dallas #davidreimer #delrio #denton #derecho #dfw #dfwmetroplex #dumas #eaglepass #elcampo #elpaso #flashflood #flood #fortstockton #fortworth #galveston #georgetown #gorillahail #granbury #hail #hereford #houston #hurricane #idabel #killeen #longview #lubbock #lufkin #marfa #mcallen #midland #news #odessa #pampa #paristx #perryton #plainview #rain #rgv #roundrock #sanangelo #sanantonio #severe #sherman #shreveport #storm #stormchasers #storms #stormsurge #supercell #temple #texarkana #texas  #texasfire #texasflood #texasstormchasers #texasweather  #TexasWildfire #texoma #today #todaynews #todaysweather #tornado #txwx  #tyler #uvalde #vernon #victoriatx #waco #Weather #weatherforecast  #wichitafalls #wildfire  #wind #windy #winter",

Kansas City is expected to get nearly a foot of snow before this storm is done.  Drivers on I-29 northbound near Platte City, MO and the Kansas City International Airport were stuck in traffic on the dangerous roads as semi trucks stopped travel for nearly 2 hours.  The dangerous road conditions left hundreds of vehicles in the ditches throughout the city.  |\n\nShot by Caleb Elliott",

                "description": "***NOT FOR BROADCAST***\nContact Brett Adair with Live Storms Media to license.\nbrett@livestormsmedia.com\n\nThe first winter storm of 2025 moved across the area this afternoon and evening, crippling the metro area with a layer of ice that left drivers stranded on the interstates, the airport closed, and treacherous driving conditions.  Kansas City is expected to get nearly a foot of snow before this storm is done.  Drivers on I-29 northbound near Platte City, MO and the Kansas City International Airport were stuck in traffic on the dangerous roads as semi trucks stopped travel for nearly 2 hours.  The dangerous road conditions left hundreds of vehicles in the ditches throughout the city.  |\n\nShot by Caleb Elliott"

            "description": "The sixth flight test of Starship launched from Starbase on November 19, 2024, seeking to expand the envelope on ship and booster capabilities and get closer to bringing reuse of the entire system online.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster successfully lifted off at the start of the launch window, with all 33 Raptor engines powering it and Starship off the pad from Starbase. Following a nominal ascent and stage separation, the booster successfully transitioned to its boostback burn to begin the return to launch site. During this phase, automated health checks of critical hardware on the launch and catch tower triggered an abort of the catch attempt. The booster then executed a pre-planned divert maneuver, performing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nStarship completed another successful ascent, placing it on the expected trajectory. The ship successfully reignited a single Raptor engine while in space, demonstrating the capabilities required to conduct a ship deorbit burn before starting fully orbital missions. With live views and telemetry being relayed by Starlink, the ship successfully made it through reentry and executed a flip, landing burn, and soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nData gathered from the multiple thermal protection experiments, as well as the successful flight through subsonic speeds at a more aggressive angle of attack, provides invaluable feedback on flight hardware performing in a flight environment as we aim for eventual ship return and catch.\n\nWith data and flight learnings as our primary payload, Starship’s sixth flight test once again delivered. Lessons learned will directly make the entire Starship system more reliable as we close in on full and rapid reusability.",
