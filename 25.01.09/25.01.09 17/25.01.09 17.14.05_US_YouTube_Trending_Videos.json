            "title": "Structures Burn as Palisades Fire Explodes to 1,200+ Acres",
            "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

                "description": "PACIFIC PALISADES, CA (CNS) – A brush fire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds scorched over 1,200 acres in Pacific Palisades Tuesday, damaging homes, forcing thousands to evacuate, and threatening over 13,200 structures. No injuries were reported.\n\nThe fire, reported around 10:30 a.m. near Piedra Morada and Monte Hermoso drives, quickly grew to 1,262 acres by mid-afternoon with no containment. Mandatory evacuations covered much of Pacific Palisades, displacing 30,000 residents. Evacuation routes clogged as vehicles were abandoned, and some residents fled on foot.\n\nEvacuation centers opened at Westwood Recreation Center for people and Pierce College for large animals, while smaller animals were directed to the Agoura Animal Care Center. Air tankers and water-dropping helicopters joined firefighters battling the flames, but strong winds hindered containment.\n\nMalibu issued evacuation warnings for areas between Carbon Beach Terrace and Las Flores Mesa Drive. By evening, the fire spread south to the coastline and west toward Malibu, jumping Tuna Canyon Road. Multiple structures, including homes and possibly parts of Palisades Charter High School, were destroyed.\n\nThe Getty Villa remained safe thanks to fire mitigation efforts, though vegetation on the site burned. Museum galleries were sealed off from smoke with state-of-the-art systems, and water storage and irrigation were deployed to protect the property.\n\nRoad closures included portions of the Pacific Coast Highway, the 10 Freeway, and Sunset Boulevard, complicating evacuation efforts.\n\nAmid red flag warnings, officials anticipated worsening conditions overnight as winds intensified. Emergency declarations were issued by local and state authorities, with Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal assistance. President Joe Biden approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support firefighting costs.\n\nCity officials relocated students from several schools, including Palisades Charter Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School, to safer locations. The South Coast AQMD issued a smoke advisory, warning of unhealthy air quality and advising residents to stay indoors.\n\nLAFD Chief Kristin Crowley and Mayor Karen Bass urged residents to comply with evacuation orders. “This is a very dangerous situation,” Bass said.\n\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation.\n\n\nInjured?

Officials said the city's hydrant system was not designed to fight wildfires on the scale seen in Los Angeles. NBC News' Gadi Schwartz reports.\n\nAuthorities in Los Angeles said at least five people have died and more than 1,000 homes and other structures have been destroyed by devastating wildfires that swept through several Los Angeles neighborhoods. Tens of thousands were evacuated and 1.5 million were reported without power. The fires were propelled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds. NBC News' Liz Kreutz reports.\n\nThe catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles County have caused toxic air in the region.

Officials said the city's hydrant system was not designed to fight wildfires on the scale seen in Los Angeles. NBC News' Gadi Schwartz reports.\n\nAuthorities in Los Angeles said at least five people have died and more than 1,000 homes and other structures have been destroyed by devastating wildfires that swept through several Los Angeles neighborhoods. Tens of thousands were evacuated and 1.5 million were reported without power. The fires were propelled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds. NBC News' Liz Kreutz reports.\n\nThe catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles County have caused toxic air in the region. NBC News' Steve Patterson reports on the threat and how people can protect themselves.\n\n» Subscribe to NBC News: http://nbcnews.to/SubscribeToNBC\n» Watch more NBC video: http://bit.ly/MoreNBCNews\n\nNBC News Digital is a collection of innovative and powerful news brands that deliver compelling, diverse and engaging news stories.

            "description": "A customer of mine asked me to look at his 2020 Toyota Tundra that has an issue starting and stalling after the engine has been running for more than a few minutes. The truck will start and run fine all day long, until you shut it off. After that you either need to spray it with starting fluid or wait until it cools off to restart. After a few tests the problem was obvious so he took it to the local Toyota dealer to have it fixed under warranty. However they informed  him my diagnosis is wrong and he needs to pay for the part because it is not under warranty. This is the exact issue he was trying to avoid.

            "description": "A major pattern shift is unfolding across the United States as we track multiple significant weather systems. An intense Arctic blast continues to grip much of the country, bringing temperatures 10-20 degrees below normal and dangerous wind chills. Lake effect snow will intensify periodically with these repeated cold surges.\nA complex storm system is developing in the Gulf, which could bring widespread heavy precipitation and even the potential for ice in unusual locations. This system's evolution remains highly uncertain, with models showing various scenarios for its track and intensity. The timing and placement of this low pressure system will be crucial for determining impacts along the East Coast.\nMeanwhile, the Western U.S. will see a breakdown of its warmer pattern as a frontal system approaches the coast. This changing pattern could lead to more widespread precipitation from the Northwest to the Rockies.\nStay tuned for updates as we continue to track these developing systems.

            "description": "A significant winter storm is approaching Texas, bringing snow, ice, and rain. Our journey will begin with snow in the Borderland region of Far West Texas near El Paso around lunchtime on Wednesday. The snowfall will spread into the Trans-Pecos, Davis Mountains, and Guadalupe Mountains during the afternoon and evening.\n\nWidespread precipitation is expected to commence Thursday morning, moving east across Texas. The freezing line on Thursday morning is projected to be in the northern Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, Central Texas, and the northern parts of East Texas. In areas where surface temperatures are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, ice and snow accumulations may occur.\n \nAs Thursday progresses into the afternoon and evening, the freezing line will shift northward, bringing the previously mentioned regions above freezing and changing precipitation from snow to rain. The Concho Valley, Big Country, Northwest Texas, the Panhandle, West Texas, Texoma, North Texas (north of D/FW), and Northeast Texas are likely to stay in the 'snow zone' for the majority of the storm, continuing into Thursday night and Friday morning.\n \nSignificant snow accumulation is anticipated, particularly across Texoma, northern D/FW, and Northeast Texas. Hazardous travel conditions are expected, especially on untreated and unplowed roads. The winter storm is expected to taper off around lunchtime on Friday as the activity moves eastward out of Texas. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoIfgmxArIATc2EpHD3W9EA/join\n\nCheck out our current LIVE STREAM: https://texasweather.video/\nOur FREE WEATHER APP: https://texasweather.app/\nOur WEBSITE/RADAR: https://texasstormchasers.com/radar\nOur SOCIAL PLATFORMS: https://linktr.ee/texasstormchasers\nDonations - Paypal@texasstormchasers.com\n *Enable 4K 60FPS when possible for best viewing results*\n\nVIDEO CHAPTERS:\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:54 - Today through Wednesday Morning (HRRR)\n1:42 - Snow Forecast: Wednesday through Friday (NAM)\n5:42 - Snow Accumulation Forecast Maps\n8:41 - Ice Accumulation Forecast Map\n10:27 - Forecast Five-Day Rain Totals\n11:44 - Long-Range Weather Forecast (GFS)\n12:40 - Five-Day Temperature Forecast\n15:57 - Conclusion & Baldyinchiefisms\n\n#texas #texasweather #weather #abilene #alpine #amarillo #austin #beaumont #beeville #bigbend #brownsville #brownwood #canadian #childress #collegestation #coriscana #corpuschristi #crashythecoldfront #dalhart #dallas #davidreimer #delrio #denton #derecho #dfw #dfwmetroplex #dumas #eaglepass #elcampo #elpaso #flashflood #flood #fortstockton #fortworth #galveston #georgetown #gorillahail #granbury #hail #hereford #houston #hurricane #idabel #killeen #longview #lubbock #lufkin #marfa #mcallen #midland #news #odessa #pampa #paristx #perryton #plainview #rain #rgv #roundrock #sanangelo #sanantonio #severe #sherman #shreveport #storm #stormchasers #storms #stormsurge #supercell #temple #texarkana #texas  #texasfire #texasflood #texasstormchasers #texasweather  #TexasWildfire #texoma #today #todaynews #todaysweather #tornado #txwx  #tyler #uvalde #vernon #victoriatx #waco #Weather #weatherforecast  #wichitafalls #wildfire  #wind #windy #winter",

                "description": "A significant winter storm is approaching Texas, bringing snow, ice, and rain. Our journey will begin with snow in the Borderland region of Far West Texas near El Paso around lunchtime on Wednesday. The snowfall will spread into the Trans-Pecos, Davis Mountains, and Guadalupe Mountains during the afternoon and evening.\n\nWidespread precipitation is expected to commence Thursday morning, moving east across Texas. The freezing line on Thursday morning is projected to be in the northern Edwards Plateau, Hill Country, Central Texas, and the northern parts of East Texas. In areas where surface temperatures are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, ice and snow accumulations may occur.\n \nAs Thursday progresses into the afternoon and evening, the freezing line will shift northward, bringing the previously mentioned regions above freezing and changing precipitation from snow to rain. The Concho Valley, Big Country, Northwest Texas, the Panhandle, West Texas, Texoma, North Texas (north of D/FW), and Northeast Texas are likely to stay in the 'snow zone' for the majority of the storm, continuing into Thursday night and Friday morning.\n \nSignificant snow accumulation is anticipated, particularly across Texoma, northern D/FW, and Northeast Texas.

            "description": "We're feeling pretty confident that a winter #storm is on its way, and it’s likely to have quite an effect on travel in Texas starting Wednesday afternoon in the west. It will gradually move east on Thursday, affecting the northern half to two-thirds of our lovely state. We can expect some #snow and ice accumulations, with a growing chance of significant snow (over 4 inches!) in areas like the Permian Basin, Big Country, Concho Valley, and parts of North Texas.

            "description": "The sixth flight test of Starship launched from Starbase on November 19, 2024, seeking to expand the envelope on ship and booster capabilities and get closer to bringing reuse of the entire system online.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster successfully lifted off at the start of the launch window, with all 33 Raptor engines powering it and Starship off the pad from Starbase. Following a nominal ascent and stage separation, the booster successfully transitioned to its boostback burn to begin the return to launch site. During this phase, automated health checks of critical hardware on the launch and catch tower triggered an abort of the catch attempt. The booster then executed a pre-planned divert maneuver, performing a landing burn and soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nStarship completed another successful ascent, placing it on the expected trajectory. The ship successfully reignited a single Raptor engine while in space, demonstrating the capabilities required to conduct a ship deorbit burn before starting fully orbital missions. With live views and telemetry being relayed by Starlink, the ship successfully made it through reentry and executed a flip, landing burn, and soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nData gathered from the multiple thermal protection experiments, as well as the successful flight through subsonic speeds at a more aggressive angle of attack, provides invaluable feedback on flight hardware performing in a flight environment as we aim for eventual ship return and catch.\n\nWith data and flight learnings as our primary payload, Starship’s sixth flight test once again delivered. Lessons learned will directly make the entire Starship system more reliable as we close in on full and rapid reusability.",
