            "description": "Gervonta “Tank” Davis may not only be the face of boxing, he might also be the world’s best fighter. Davis delivered yet another viral moment, successfully defending his WBA Lightweight World Title by knocking out the previously unbeaten Frank “The Ghost” Martin with a vicious left hand at 1:29 of the eighth round in the PBC Pay-Per-View main event on Prime Video Saturday night, which marked the 100th championship fight night at the historic MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nFighting in his first world title bout, Martin delivered a high-level performance. Davis (30-0, 28 KOs), however, showed once again that he is indeed special.\n \n“Thank you guys for coming out, great event. I appreciate everyone who made this possible. We did it once again. On to the next!” said Davis.\n \nA packed house full of 13,249 were on-hand to witness a masterful performance from Davis. Martin (18-1, 12 KOs) used quick combinations and elite athleticism to bank the early rounds. Davis took his time, opening up in the third round and constantly pinning Martin against the ropes.\n \n“Frank Martin was a great fighter. He put up a good four to five rounds,” said Davis. “I was finding my range. (Martin) had a decent jab and was moving a lot and I just had to break him down as the fight went on.”\n \nThe undefeated three-division world champion applied steady, intelligent pressure, slowly breaking Martin down and setting him up for the highlight-reel finish in the eighth. With Martin backed into a corner, Davis rocked him with a powerful left uppercut followed by a left cross that left Martin flat on his back. As Martin struggled to rise, referee Harvey Dock wisely waved the fight off.\n \n“I knew he wasn’t getting back up because of the way he fell, and I knew he was gonna tire himself out, that was the whole gameplan,” said Davis.\n \n“I’m holding my head high,” said Martin. “At the end of the day, I came out to be great, but I came up short. I got caught with a shot that I didn’t see, one of those shots that comes from underneath and it went from there. I guess I didn’t make the count, but I appreciate everybody that came out, everybody that’s been a part of this event.\n \n“I’ll be back. Going to go watch the film, get better and grow. Y’all will see me again.”\n \nDavis has similar plans. “Now we go back to the drawing board and I want to fight all of them.”\n\n#TankMartin #GervontaDavis #FrankMartin \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

I got caught with a shot that I didn’t see, one of those shots that comes from underneath and it went from there.

                "description": "Gervonta “Tank” Davis may not only be the face of boxing, he might also be the world’s best fighter. Davis delivered yet another viral moment, successfully defending his WBA Lightweight World Title by knocking out the previously unbeaten Frank “The Ghost” Martin with a vicious left hand at 1:29 of the eighth round in the PBC Pay-Per-View main event on Prime Video Saturday night, which marked the 100th championship fight night at the historic MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n \nFighting in his first world title bout, Martin delivered a high-level performance. Davis (30-0, 28 KOs), however, showed once again that he is indeed special.\n \n“Thank you guys for coming out, great event. I appreciate everyone who made this possible. We did it once again. On to the next!” said Davis.\n \nA packed house full of 13,249 were on-hand to witness a masterful performance from Davis. Martin (18-1, 12 KOs) used quick combinations and elite athleticism to bank the early rounds. Davis took his time, opening up in the third round and constantly pinning Martin against the ropes.\n \n“Frank Martin was a great fighter. He put up a good four to five rounds,” said Davis. “I was finding my range. (Martin) had a decent jab and was moving a lot and I just had to break him down as the fight went on.”\n \nThe undefeated three-division world champion applied steady, intelligent pressure, slowly breaking Martin down and setting him up for the highlight-reel finish in the eighth. With Martin backed into a corner, Davis rocked him with a powerful left uppercut followed by a left cross that left Martin flat on his back. As Martin struggled to rise, referee Harvey Dock wisely waved the fight off.\n \n“I knew he wasn’t getting back up because of the way he fell, and I knew he was gonna tire himself out, that was the whole gameplan,” said Davis.\n \n“I’m holding my head high,” said Martin. “At the end of the day, I came out to be great, but I came up short.

Get some jobs from the neighborhood and gain a humble income. Start a company of up to 4 people and divide the work by authorizing them in various topics.\n\nBring Your Design to Life\nPurchase a land. Design a house. Build it. Decorate with individual touches and bring out your inner designer. Sell it at an auction. The\nland is all yours. You decide.\n\nCO-OP In A Open-world simulator\nEver imagined starting a company with your friends? Of course, you can manage the entire process alone but it's always funnier with friends trolling you. (Well, not pretty sure about this one.)

            "description": "Special Thanks To Prompter People For Sponsoring Today's Episode! \nStart Creating now at https://www.PrompterPeople.com\n\nInside Out 2 was such a beautiful movie, wasn't it, loyal Theorist?

It was my first time in a Yurt and I put together a little video to show what that whole thing is all about. The state parks here rent these out and they come equipped with some basic stuff (beds, seating, lights). Bring your own bedding, food, and cooking supplies. It was a fun night hunkering down! \n\nThe adventure will continue over the coming weeks. Stay tuned! \n\nCheers everyone.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n• Website: https://campingwithsteve.com\n• My Amazon store: https://amzn.to/49li5Az\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGear:\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha FX3\nhttps://amzn.to/3SIMQra\n\nLens: Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G\nhttps://amzn.to/3SL1rm7\n\nEditing: Apple 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Final Cut Pro\nhttps://amzn.to/3YeuCiy\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSocials: \n• Facebook: https://facebook.com/campingwithsteve\n• Instagram: https://instagram.com/campingsteve\n• Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/hunkerdownsteve\n• TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@campingwithsteve\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#camping #hunkerdown #yurt #glamping #campingwithsteve",

                "description": "I am in the US for a month having the adventure of my life. The only way to stay cool and go \"camping\" in Georgia was to rent an air conditioned Yurt. It was my first time in a Yurt and I put together a little video to show what that whole thing is all about. The state parks here rent these out and they come equipped with some basic stuff (beds, seating, lights). Bring your own bedding, food, and cooking supplies. It was a fun night hunkering down! \n\nThe adventure will continue over the coming weeks. Stay tuned! \n\nCheers everyone.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n• Website: https://campingwithsteve.com\n• My Amazon store: https://amzn.to/49li5Az\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGear:\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha FX3\nhttps://amzn.to/3SIMQra\n\nLens: Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G\nhttps://amzn.to/3SL1rm7\n\nEditing: Apple 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Final Cut Pro\nhttps://amzn.to/3YeuCiy\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSocials: \n• Facebook: https://facebook.com/campingwithsteve\n• Instagram: https://instagram.com/campingsteve\n• Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/hunkerdownsteve\n• TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@campingwithsteve\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#camping #hunkerdown #yurt #glamping #campingwithsteve"

                "description": "Let’s settle the debate on regular pavement and VHT: which is the quickest accelerating American car in history, the Dodge Challenger SRT Demom 170 or the Lucid Air Sapphire?\n\n=\nThis episode is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nIn this episode, we race the two most powerful American production cars in history, the 1234-hp Lucid Air Sapphire and the 1025-hp Dodge Challenger SRT D170.\n\nThe first race takes place on regular asphalt, with our standard weather-corrected numbers. With the help of veteran drag racer, we achieve the quickest 0-60 and ¼-mile times ever seen from a Challenger. But is that enough to beat the Sapphire?\n\nEither way, the Demon’s Mickey Thompson drag radials aren’t meant for an unprepped surface, so we leave Willow Springs and head to the Famoso Drag Strip to race on “glue” — the VHT-prepped surface. \n\nHere, Tom Bailey’s experience launching the Challenger pays dividends as we try to recreate Dodge’s claimed 8.91-second quarter-mile run and dethrone the Lucid. Will it work?\n\nLet’s fight about it.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 America Divided: ICE vs EV\n1:16 The Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 Specs\n2:43 The Lucid Air Sapphire Specs\n4:21 Asphalt Race: Demon 170 vs Lucid Sapphire\n5:04 Drag Race Replay: What Happened?\n8:53 Results and Willow Springs Conclusion\n9:27 Moving to Famoso Drag Strip\n9:42 What is VHT?\n10:29 What is Rollout?\n11:07 How do the Timing Lights Work?\n12:55 Demon vs Sapphire race on VHT\n14:53 Conclusion and Results\n\n===\n\nPerformance Testing Results: \n\nLucid Air Sapphire\n0-60: 2.1 seconds\n¼-mile: 9.2 sec @ 158 mph\n\nDodge Challenger SRT Demon 170\n0-60: 3.7 seconds\n¼-mile: 11.2 sec @ 139 mph\n\n\nVHT Prepped Surface Results:\nLucid Air Sapphire: 9.002 sec @ 155.57 mph (0-60 in 1.92 sec)\nDodge SRT Demon 170: 9.721 sec @ 143.72 mph"

She opens up about her tumultuous journey growing up and navigating the entertainment industry. Meagan shares an intense story from her time on a Nickelodeon show, detailing how a fight escalated into a dangerous brawl, making her question her actions and seek peace.\n\nMeagan discusses facing racism at school and being unfairly targeted by teachers. She also shares the emotional impact of losing possessions given to her by her father, who had a background in the LAPD.\n\nReflecting on her acting career, Meagan talked about her early roles in the cult classic \"Friday\" and working with icons like Chris Tucker and Ice Cube. She also shared valuable advice from Michael Clarke Duncan about treating everyone on set with respect.\n\nDespite numerous challenges and tough choices, Meagan underscores the importance of authenticity and not compromising oneself for success. She highlights her resilience, the lessons she’s learned, and the meaningful relationships she’s built throughout her life and career.\n\nCelebrating 30 years in the business, Meagan expresses gratitude and hope for 30 more years, emphasizing the importance of love and support in her journey. She shares stories about her experiences as a young black actress in a predominantly white industry.\n\nMeagan also recounted facing intense pressures on set, including a difficult experience with a director that almost made her reconsider her acting career. This moment, however, reinforced her determination to succeed.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Meagan’s resilience shines as she speaks about her mother’s wisdom, God’s guidance, and the significance of humility and confidence. She recounts her growth in the industry and her determination to be recognized for her talent.\n\nIn this interview Meagan also touches on her experiences with homeschooling due to her acting career, the guidance she received from industry veterans, and her decision to focus on movies over TV shows to explore diverse characters. Despite the adversities, Meagan’s journey is a testament to her strength and the valuable lessons she’s learned along the way.\n\nJoin Shannon Sharpe and Meagan Good in this heartfelt and inspiring conversation, celebrating her incredible career and the strength she’s shown in overcoming obstacles and staying true to herself.\n\n#ClubShayShay​ #MeaganGood #johnathanmajors \n\nBuy LePortier: https://leportiercognac.com/products/shay_vsop_750ml/\n\nGet 50% off your first box of fresh, healthy food at TheFarmers Dog.com/SHAYSHAY\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest Club Shay Shay content: https://www.youtube.com/c/ClubShayShay?sub_confirmation=1\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/club-shay-shay/id1531023690\nListen to the Club Shay Shay podcast on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/060hDdnydsJyMi17TmvyAh?si=iuda1z7oTE-21ZYzwiUdhg&nd=1\n\nLike Club Shay Shay on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/ClubShayShay/\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Twitter: https://x.com/clubshayshay?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Instagram: https://instagram.com/clubshayshay?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\nFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: https://x.com/shannonsharpe?s=21&t=PF1soCgsTT_NEerDJm9Lfg\nFollow Club Shay Shay on Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@clubshayshaypod?_t=8fJ79WZy2fb&_r=1\n\nAbout Club Shay Shay:\nClub Shay Shay is a weekly podcast hosted by Shannon Sharpe – 3x Super Bowl champion, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and co-host of First Take on ESPN.

            "description": "Paris’s bold Olympic promise to clean the River Seine.\n\nThis video is presented by BetterHelp. Head to http://betterhelp.com/voxvideo for 10% off your first month.

Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nA key promise in Paris’s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics was that its famous river, the Seine, would be cleaned up in time to host open water swimming events: the triathlon, para triathlon, and marathon swimming. But swimming has been banned in the Seine for a century because the Paris sewer system is designed to dump wastewater into the river during heavy rain, when the sewers get overwhelmed by stormwater. \n\nWhen that happens, levels of E. coli, a bacteria associated with fecal matter, spike in the river, making it too contaminated to swim in. In order to make good on its promise to clean the river, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that includes a massive underground tank and tunnel system meant to hold excess sewage during heavy rain and prevent further contamination of the Seine. \n\nWater quality testing will be done daily ahead of the Olympic games this summer, and Paris officials are hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed. \n\nFollow the daily water quality tests of the Seine from the City of Paris here: \nhttps://www.paris.fr/pages/meteo-de-la-seine-quelle-est-la-qualite-de-l-eau-du-fleuve-27467\n\nCheck out some of the data used in this video, along with additional water quality tests, from Fluidion:\nhttps://fluidion.com/open-data-initiative/2024-seine-water-quality\n\nAre Olympians Going to Swim in Poop Water? – The Cut\nhttps://www.thecut.com/article/olympics-2024-athletes-swim-unsanitary-seine-river.html\n\nWill the Seine be ready for Olympic swimming?

Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nA key promise in Paris’s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics was that its famous river, the Seine, would be cleaned up in time to host open water swimming events: the triathlon, para triathlon, and marathon swimming. But swimming has been banned in the Seine for a century because the Paris sewer system is designed to dump wastewater into the river during heavy rain, when the sewers get overwhelmed by stormwater. \n\nWhen that happens, levels of E. coli, a bacteria associated with fecal matter, spike in the river, making it too contaminated to swim in. In order to make good on its promise to clean the river, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that includes a massive underground tank and tunnel system meant to hold excess sewage during heavy rain and prevent further contamination of the Seine. \n\nWater quality testing will be done daily ahead of the Olympic games this summer, and Paris officials are hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed. \n\nFollow the daily water quality tests of the Seine from the City of Paris here: \nhttps://www.paris.fr/pages/meteo-de-la-seine-quelle-est-la-qualite-de-l-eau-du-fleuve-27467\n\nCheck out some of the data used in this video, along with additional water quality tests, from Fluidion:\nhttps://fluidion.com/open-data-initiative/2024-seine-water-quality\n\nAre Olympians Going to Swim in Poop Water? – The Cut\nhttps://www.thecut.com/article/olympics-2024-athletes-swim-unsanitary-seine-river.html\n\nWill the Seine be ready for Olympic swimming?
