            "description": "oops! she did it again!\n#M3GAN2 is only in theaters June 27. \n\n---\nWebsite: http://www.M3GANmovie.com\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/universalpictures  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meetM3GAN/\nX: https://twitter.com/meetm3gan\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/M3GAN/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/m3gan\n\n\nThe murderous doll who captivated pop culture in 2023 is back. And this time she’s not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon—led by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and director Gerard Johnstone—reboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0.\n\nTwo years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on a murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently destroyed, M3GAN’s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma’s niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma’s overprotective rules. \n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia’s self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. \n\nWith the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I bitch is about to meet her match.\n\nDirected by acclaimed returning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone, the film co-stars returning cast members Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps as Gemma’s loyal tech teammates, Cole and Tess, and new characters played by Aristotle Athari (Saturday Night Live, Hacks), Timm Sharp (Apples Never Fall, Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement (Avatar: The Way of Water, What We Do in the Shadows). \n\nProduced by James Wan, Jason Blum and Allison Williams, the film is executive produced by Gerard Johnstone, Adam Hendricks, Greg Gilreath, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Mark D. Katchur. \n\nThe first M3GAN film shattered box office records, opening to $30.4 million domestically to become the biggest opening weekend for a PG-13 horror film since",

            "description": "President Trump says cars made in the U.S. will face “absolutely no tariff,” but it’s not so simple. No car is built from 100% U.S. parts—not even the U.S.-built Ford F-150 pickup truck. Major components of the car are from Mexico, Canada and South Korea, which could all be a part of the auto tariffs.\n\nWSJ takes a look inside a Ford F-150 to better understand Trump’s slew of new tariffs and why automakers are warning it could backfire. \n\nChapters:\n0:00 Trump’s auto tariffs\n0:53 Tariff breakdown of car parts\n4:12 Challenge of opening new plants\n5:32 Economic impact and broader threats\n\nNews Explainers\nSome days the high-speed news cycle can bring more questions than answers. WSJ’s news explainers break down the day's biggest stories into bite-size pieces to help you make sense of the news.\n\n#Trump #Cars #WSJ",

The match was decided in extra-time, following a nail-biting end to the game. Barrenetxea gave Real Sociedad the lead after 16 minutes and Endrick made it 1-1 in the 30th minute after an exquisite assist from Vini Jr. with the outside of his right foot. In the second half, two Alaba own goals made it 1-3 in the 80th minute, but from 82‘ to 86’ Madrid rampaged and Bellingham, after another precise assist from Vini Jr, and Tchouameni brought the score to 3-3. In the 93rd minute, Oyarzabal took the game into extra-time, where the Whites sealed their semi-final berth in the 115th minute when Rüdiger headed home Güler's corner.\n#LaCopaMola\n\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT",

Yet for some reason, they now want me dead. This is How I Got Hunted by Minecraft Bounty Hunters. \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable Universe series where he broke into Minecraft's Most Secure Prisons or got Hunted by Minecraft's Deadliest Players. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with rekrap2, Grian or MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @jumperwho @Leowook @Nufuli @Derapchu@BitOtterYT @Wato-1876 @Reeon @meta64 Pro @mixiku_ @Hexatope @Dimofyy @TheSorta1 @nezoshoki Puki \n\nThis is Episode 3 of Season 2 Parrot Videos on the Unstable SMP :)\n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe / Unstable SMP: a staged Minecraft server created by Parrot, Wemmbu, and Spoke to tell stories in Minecraft. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

Yet for some reason, they now want me dead. This is How I Got Hunted by Minecraft Bounty Hunters. \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable Universe series where he broke into Minecraft's Most Secure Prisons or got Hunted by Minecraft's Deadliest Players. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with rekrap2, Grian or MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @jumperwho @Leowook @Nufuli @Derapchu@BitOtterYT @Wato-1876 @Reeon @meta64 Pro @mixiku_ @Hexatope @Dimofyy @TheSorta1 @nezoshoki Puki \n\nThis is Episode 3 of Season 2 Parrot Videos on the Unstable SMP :)\n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe / Unstable SMP: a staged Minecraft server created by Parrot, Wemmbu, and Spoke to tell stories in Minecraft. \n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

Now, she finds herself once again in the waiting room of Brighter Days Inc., but this time for a very different appointment. The company now offers advanced memory restoration, allowing her to revisit a curated selection of moments from her life—both cherished and painful. As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today. She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma. In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there’s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\n \nSet against the music of eternal sunshine deluxe: brighter days ahead, and directed by frequent collaborators Christian Breslauer and Ariana Grande, this film explores love, loss, growth, and the fleeting nature of memory, delivering a heartfelt cinematic experience that closes the door on this eternal sunshine album era.\n\n►Subscribe to Ariana Grande: http://ArianaGrande.lnk.to/subscribe\n \n►Follow Ariana Grande\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/arianagrande/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/arianagrande \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@arianagrande\nWebsite: https://www.arianagrande.com/ \n \n#arianagrande #brighterdaysahead #eternalsunshine\n\n\nMusic video by Ariana Grande performing brighter days ahead.© 2025 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.",

The company now offers advanced memory restoration, allowing her to revisit a curated selection of moments from her life—both cherished and painful. As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today. She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma. In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there’s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\n \nSet against the music of eternal sunshine deluxe: brighter days ahead, and directed by frequent collaborators Christian Breslauer and Ariana Grande, this film explores love, loss, growth, and the fleeting nature of memory, delivering a heartfelt cinematic experience that closes the door on this eternal sunshine album era.\n\n►Subscribe to Ariana Grande: http://ArianaGrande.lnk.to/subscribe\n \n►Follow Ariana Grande\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/arianagrande/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/arianagrande \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@arianagrande\nWebsite: https://www.arianagrande.com/ \n \n#arianagrande #brighterdaysahead #eternalsunshine\n\n\nMusic video by Ariana Grande performing brighter days ahead.© 2025 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc."

Para tornar as coisas mais interessantes, decidi que quem conseguisse vender as coisas dentro de sua unidade de armazenamento por mais dinheiro ganharia tudo nas unidades de armazenamento. Não acredito que as coisas que foram deixadas nessas unidades de armazenamento. AJ e Big Justice (também conhecidos como The Costco Guys) até se juntaram à diversão e eu não acredito nas coisas que eles encontraram!

Tinkerbell had no other choice right? If she’d let Wendy live then Peter Pan would’ve left Neverland, left Tinkerbell and stopped believing in fairies. Tinks very existence had rested on a knife edge. So Wendy had to go. \n\nThe first laugh of a newborn baby is what brings fairies into existence and, as Tink previously discovered, it is that same child that stops believing that then ends the same fairies life. Tink and her friends had found the children they were connected to, Peter Pan and the Lost boys. And Wendy and her brothers had almost taken them away until she’d intervened. Now Tink and her friends were safe it was their responsibility to help the whole of Pixie Hollow. Fairies were still dying out, the other inhabitants were fading at an alarming rate.\n\nTo ensure their people’s continued existence Tink and her friends would have to do something bigger, something drastic to ensure humans never stopped believing in fairies.\n\nLuckily Tink has been experimenting with Pixie Dust, searching for a way to bring fairies back from the dead. Sadly, she never did find a way to revive fawn and Silvermist. But she did happen upon a way to enhance their powers, weaponise them, to create an army charged with Pixie Dust. Tinkerbell knew that much power in one fairies hands was wrong, but with the crisis she was facing she didn’t have a choice. \n\nNow with almost limitless power at her fingertips, Tink and her friends finally had a solution to their problem. But she has another foe to face first. Peter Pan won’t sit idly by after the death of Wendy. Tink crossed a line she may well regret crossing very soon…\n\n\nByyyeeeee\n\nPS.

I apologize if the video was too technical/low editing, I have not made a video this long in a looong time. I underestimated how much work goes into the \"polishing\" phase of a project like this lol. I had a few pro Minecraft modders react to my work, and they all thought it had high potential, but held back by random bugs/balance problems. Overall, I'm kinda disappointed that I couldn't make more in the time frame, but the process itself was very valuable and I learned a lot.

Previously, Mbappé had put Ancelotti's side ahead by converting a Panenka-style penalty. There was no option but to turn the game around after the break, and the equaliser came almost straight from the kick-off. In the 47th minute, Bellingham, with hardly any space, worked a shot inside the box but Dmitrovic responded with a fine save. The rebound fell to Brahim, his shot was blocked by Tapia on the line, but the ball hit the crossbar and Bellingham was on hand to acrobatically slot it home. The minutes ticked by and in the 76th minute came the deserved reward of the third goal. Mbappé scored from a masterful indirect free kick from the edge of the area, the Frenchman's second consecutive brace. From then until the end, Ancelotti's men were able to hold on to their advantage and take all three points.\n#RealMadridLeganés | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT",

From then until the end, Ancelotti's men were able to hold on to their advantage and take all three points.\n#RealMadridLeganés | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT"

                "description": "El Real Madrid sumó los tres puntos en el Bernabéu frente al Leganés, que llegó al descanso ganando 1-2. Antes, Mbappé había adelantado a los de Ancelotti al convertir un penalti a lo Panenka. Había que dar la vuelta al marcador tras el paso por los vestuarios y nada más salir llegó el empate. Bellingham, sin apenas espacio, se sacó en el 47’ un disparo dentro del área que obtuvo como respuesta una gran estirada de Dmitrovic. El rechazo llegó a Brahim y su remate fue repelido por Tapia sobre la línea de gol, pero el balón golpeó en el larguero y Bellingham apareció para llevarlo a la red con un remate acrobático. Transcurrían los minutos y en el 76’ llegó el merecido premio del tercer gol. Lo firmó Mbappé en un magistral libre indirecto desde la frontal del área. Segundo doblete consecutivo del galo. De ahí hasta el final, los de Ancelotti supieron mantener la renta obtenida y sumar los tres puntos. \n#RealMadridLeganés | #LaLigaHighlights\n\n🆕📺 RM PLAY: https://play.realmadrid.com\n\n🎥  SUBSCRIBE | SUSCRÍBETE:\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=realmadridcf\n\n📱 FOLLOW US | SÍGUENOS:\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/realmadrid\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@realmadrid\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/realmadrid\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/realmadrid\nSNAPCHAT: https://snapchat.com/add/realmadrid\nFACEBOOK: https://facebook.com/realmadrid\n\n💳 BECOME A MADRIDISTA | HAZTE MADRIDISTA:\nhttps://bit.ly/become_a_madridista_YT"

                "description": "No one questions whether Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario are heroes: they have saved the Green Hill Zone and Super Mario World more times than anyone can count. But they haven’t done it alone, of course: the Super Mario Bros includes Luigi and Tails is never far from Sonic. If the Blue Blur and the Italian plumber remembered that, maybe this sidekick uprising wouldn’t be happening! \n\nClank, Aku Aku, Ken, Atreus, Daxter and so many others have answered the call: they’re sick of not getting the credit they deserve. So, turn your speakers all the way up to 11, grab the other controller, and press start, because this is Ready Player Two!\n\n🎧 Listen to the song 🎧\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/4jcnX3k \nApple Music: https://apple.co/3XYF1Sf \n\n🟣 Support Mashed and become a Mashed+ member today! https://www.youtube.com/@mashed/join \n\nProduced by Tom Jenkins & Ben Michael\nSong by The Chalkeaters\nWritten by Alios https://linktr.ee/aliosmusic\nArrangement by @ErgyErgy, Tim Maslov https://open.spotify.com/artist/5VJwQdLX9Nz53YqvamosOb?si=GVYJUsVTS3-re80s0mVTkQ\nMusic Produced by Tim Maslov \n\nVocals:\nVoice of Tails by @ChichiAi \nVoice of Luigi & Mario by @AlexWalkerSmith \nVoice of Sonic by @Coffinjockey \nWith a special appearance by @JohnnyGioeliOfficial \n\nGuitars by Pavel Mihalev\nBass by Roberto Pace\nDrums by Chris Barber\n\nMixing Engineer - Ilya Lukashev https://www.instagram.com/lukashevmixing\n\nPre-Production & Animation by @SmashToons \nAdditional Animation by Oni L.

Hoe shake them titties. Man, im looking for the littest lit bitches in the city. \nWho gon really get the littest\nWhere the niggas that’s the Trillest? \nBreak yo back if you know that you the biggest \n\nBounce that ass. Hoe shake them titties.

            "description": "In Part 2 of our sit-down with Drake Bell, we pick up right where we left off—unpacking everything that came after the show ended. From personal regrets to private reconciliations, we reflect on the years apart, the moments that shaped us, and how we finally found our way back to friendship.\n\nWe talk openly about what drove us apart and what’s bringing us back together. Drake shares unbelievable stories—playing a private concert in Switzerland for eight kids, becoming a children’s menu icon in Mexico, and his surreal trip to Brunei with Pamela Anderson. But he also opens up about the real stuff: going to rehab, becoming a father, learning to survive—and then choosing to live fully.\n\nWe revisit our shared past with fresh perspective and a whole lot more grace. It’s funny, it’s heartbreaking, it’s hopeful—and it’s the closure we didn’t know we needed.\n\nWe love this episode. We love Drake.

Values will be tested and the players’ motivations highlighted when the fierce competition unfolds on the beautiful islands of Fiji.
