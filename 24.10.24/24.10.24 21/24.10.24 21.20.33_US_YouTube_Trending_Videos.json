                "description": "Things look a little different around Lumon.\n\nSeverance Season 2 premieres January 17 on Apple TV+ http://apple.co/_Severance\n\nIn Severance, Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure, which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself.\n\nIn season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.\n\nSeason 2 reunites its ensemble cast of stars including Emmy Award nominee Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken and Academy and Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette, and welcomes new series regular Sarah Bock.\n\nSeverance is executive produced by Ben Stiller, who also directs five episodes this season in addition to directors Uta Bresiewitz, Sam Donovan and Jessica Lee Gagné. The series is written, created and executive produced by Dan Erickson. Severance season two is also executive produced by John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Sam Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz, Nicholas Weinstock. In addition to starring, Adam Scott and Patricia Arquette serve as executive producers.

Watch the activity helping on the Randle back down and then the great recovery…\nThe Lakers defense led to another Lebron bucket and this time, it was a way better finish.\nBut despite the highlights, and the crowd going crazy, Minnesota managed to keep up with the Lakers, led by Anthony Edwards with 8 first quarter points, and he showed the crowd some of his flash.\nSecond quarter comes along and you see the 2-3 zone that the Wolves are in, but check out D’Angelo Russel literally sneaking his way to the middle of the zone, forcing a response from the back line, and delivering a fantastic pass to the cutting Hayes for the dunk.\nThen, moments later Reddick runs horns with the sharpshooter Knecht on the weak side. And watch him take off setting a back screen for Lebron, clearing out the perimeter for a handoff and a screen for himself. Reid has to come out and contest it, so this split second of help allows Hayes to cut inside, and the great pass by Knecht for the throwdown.\nThe next possession it’s almost the exact same thing with Dalton screening again for Lebron of the ball and sprinting out around the Jackson Hayes pick and this time, the defender is trailing him so he can fire away from downtown…\nThese terrific offensive possessions would spark a 27-6 run by the Lakers, sending the arena into delirium.\nAnd this built enough of a cushion for Bronny to come into the game in a historic moment.\nAnd he had his 1 chance for a bucket…\nHe couldn’t hit this one for the fans, but senior sure gave them something to cheer for.\nThe Lakers are up by 13 at the half, and JJ starts off the second half with some more motion into the offense.\nAustin Reeves runs across 2 picks on the so-called Iverson cut, and Lebron follows, setting a hybrid between a screen and a slip, which creates hesitation for the defense, and at this moment he is obviously open for the bounce pass, which creates a 2 on 1 between him AD and Gobert. So it’s a perfect execution as we let it roll, for a beautiful alley oop dunk.\nThing is, it was mostly AD for the Lakers in this quarter. On both ends of the court.\nAnd despite a terrific quarter of 13 points and 5 rebounds, Minnesota started to get into a rhythm and went on a mini run towards the end.\nThis gave me hope for an exciting finish but maaan, Anthony Davis went god mode in the 4th and he was not going to let the Lakers lose on opening night.\n36 points, 16 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocks a blockbuster performance from AD.\nI gave this game a 6.6 on Rate Game which was obviously lower than what Lakers fans rated it.\nAnd if you’re new around here, Rate Game is an app that I’m a part of, made for the real fans of the game.\nIn a world polluted by betting and gambling, Rate Game is a pure diary where you keep track of what games you watched and which ones were the best.

Definitely wouldn't have done this run without being called out on it.\n\nThe candlestick weapons are a weird weapon set. They require stats they don't actually use, have a miserable excuse for a weapon art, and are quite literally candlesticks.\nSo naturally, that means they're perfect for challenge runs.\n\nCan you beat Dark Souls 3 with only the Scholar's Candlestick and the Cleric's Candlestick?\n\n|| MUSIC ||\nLoad Your Game - Animal Crossing\nRPG Store (Interlude) - Chris Doerksen\nNight in the Swamp (Scene 2) - Vectorman 2\nMain Theme - Role Models\nPond - Bugdom\nBreak The Targets - Super Smash Bros\nIcebreaker - Job Job\nSubmission Plaza Theme - Check Mii Out\nLower Brinstar - Metroid Dread\nAnchordeep - Cult of the Lamb\nChildren of the Omnissiah - Warhammer 40k Mechanicus\nDust (Carpenter Brut Remix) - Hotline Miami 2\nPlack Beach - Mario and Luigi : Bowser's Inside Story\nElven Town - Shining Force 2\nHydrocity Act 2 - Sonic 3 and Knuckles\nJungle C - Spelunky\nPoison Swamp -  @nectoulin  \nRuined Paths - Gravity Rush\nUnbreakable - Armored Core 6\nGnat Attack 2 -  Mario Paint\nCrossroads - Hollow Knight\n\n|| Lemon's Socials ||\nTwitter  | https://twitter.com/TheBacklogs\nDiscord | https://discord.gg/HTPV23CYEz\n2nd Channel | https://youtube.com/c/thebacklogsshortcutunlocked\n\n|| Support the Channel ||\nPatreon | https://www.patreon.com/thebacklogs\nYoutube Members | Click \"JOIN\" below the video!\n\n|| Business Inquiries ||\nEmail | thebacklogschallenge@gmail.com\n\n#thebacklogs #challengerun #ad #darksouls3 \n\n0:00 The Intro\n1:45 The Sponsor\n3:12 The Run"

                "description": "I was speechless finding a new baby creature inside my giant rainforest vivarium (called Pantdora), after leaving for 18 days. Returning from abroad, I needed to assess if there had been any  damages to the ecosystem while I was away. It turns out, inspecting the vivaria and taking inventory of its various animals was quite the adventure, especially what I discovered regarding a certain mystery egg. Hope you enjoy Episode 9, Season 3 of my Ecosystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever!

            "description": "Undefeated IBF Super Welterweight World Champion Bakhram Murtazaliev dropped former world champion Tim Tszyu four times on his way to a third-round stoppage in the main event of PBC Championship Boxing on Prime Video action Saturday night from the Caribe Royale Resort in Orlando, Florida.\n \nAfter winning the title in his opponent’s home territory of Germany earlier this year, Murtazaliev (23-0, 17 KOs) made a statement by dropping Tszyu (24-2, 17 KOs) early and often on his way to the dominant stoppage.\n \nThe first knockdown came in round two with a strong counter left hook sending Tszyu to the canvas. Tszyu showed the incredible grit that’s made him a superstar in his native Australia to rise to his feet, but was ultimately sent back to the ground two more times in the round.\n \n\"We just worked on these combinations all the time and when the fight came, it was automatic,” said Murtazaliev. “We worked for 10 weeks on those punches that hurt him. We created opportunities and we believed that we could win this fight.”\n \nContinuing to press forward and look for moments in round three, Murtazaliev landed another vicious counter left hand that scored him his fourth knockdown in less than three rounds. While Tszyu continued to battle back, the onslaught from Murtazaliev proved to be too much as Tszyu’s corner threw in the towel, ending the fight 1:55 into the round.\n \n\"When I landed that first big shot, I knew how hard it was,” said Murtazaliev. “Tszyu is a real warrior and I hope one day we can work together and spar and help each other to grow.\"\n \n\"Every time I step into the ring I leave it all in there,” said Tszyu. “Things didn't go to plan and the better man won tonight. No excuses. After the first shot, things started not going according to plan. That's part of boxing, you get hit and reactions get slower. Bakhram is the man at 154.\"\n\n#MurtazalievTszyu #TimTszyu #Murtazaliev \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

            "description": "What if someone you loved became something else? #WolfManMovie only in theaters January 17.\n\n---\nFrom Blumhouse and visionary writer-director Leigh Whannell, the creators of the chilling modern monster tale The Invisible Man, comes a terrifying new lupine nightmare: Wolf Man. \n\nGolden Globe nominee Christopher Abbott (Poor Things, It Comes at Night) stars as Blake, a San Francisco husband and father, who inherits his remote childhood home in rural Oregon after his own father vanishes and is presumed dead. With his marriage to his high-powered wife, Charlotte (Emmy winner Julia Garner; Ozark, Inventing Anna), fraying, Blake persuades Charlotte to take a break from the city and visit the property with their young daughter, Ginger (Matlida Firth; Hullraisers, Coma).\n\nBut as the family approaches the farmhouse in the dead of night, they’re attacked by an unseen animal and, in a desperate escape, barricade themselves inside the home as the creature prowls the perimeter. As the night stretches on, however, Blake begins to behave strangely, transforming into something unrecognizable, and Charlotte will be forced to decide whether the terror within their house is more lethal than the danger without. \n\nThe film co-stars Sam Jaeger (The Handmaid’s Tale), Ben Prendergast (The Sojourn Audio Drama) and Benedict Hardie (The Invisible Man). \n\nWolf Man is directed by Whannell, whose previous films with Blumhouse include The Invisible Man, Upgrade and Insidious: Chapter 3. The screenplay is written by Leigh Whannell & Corbett Tuck, Lauren Schuker Blum & Rebecca Angelo (Dumb Money). \n\nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and is executive produced by Ryan Gosling, Ken Kao, Bea Sequeira, Mel Turner and Leigh Whannell. Wolf Man is a Blumhouse and Motel Movies production. \n\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/WolfManMovie/ \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wolfmanmovie/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/universalpictures\nX: https://x.com/WolfManMovie25\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics\nWebsite: https://www.wolfmanmovie.com",

Because hybrid engines start & stop frequently, this often results in lower engine temperatures, which in turn can create issues with water and fuel dilution. Frequent start/stops, water, and fuel, can all create problems that exacerbate engine wear. \n\nTo combat this, Mobil 1 has developed Mobil 1 hybrid, a full synthetic motor oil that is designed to meet the challenges that hybrid vehicles place on engines. This video will focus on three main subjects: how hybrids work, why hybrids are hard on engines, and what solutions exist to combat these challenges. \n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below! \nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained \nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA",

                "description": "Hybrid vehicles are uniquely challenging due to the frequent engine start/stops, as well as lower overall engine temperatures, which can lead to water and fuel dilution.\nSponsored by Mobil 1 – https://www.mobil.com/en/lubricants/ \n\nHybrid vehicles are a great solution to improving fuel economy, but they have their own unique challenges. Because hybrid engines start & stop frequently, this often results in lower engine temperatures, which in turn can create issues with water and fuel dilution. Frequent start/stops, water, and fuel, can all create problems that exacerbate engine wear. \n\nTo combat this, Mobil 1 has developed Mobil 1 hybrid, a full synthetic motor oil that is designed to meet the challenges that hybrid vehicles place on engines. This video will focus on three main subjects: how hybrids work, why hybrids are hard on engines, and what solutions exist to combat these challenges. \n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below! \nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained \nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA"
