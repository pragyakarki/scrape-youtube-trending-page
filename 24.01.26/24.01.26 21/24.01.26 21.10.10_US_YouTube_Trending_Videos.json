The game is set in an open world filled with animal-like creatures called Pals. Players can battle and capture Pals to use them for base building, traversal, and combat1. The game was launched into Early Access on PC and Xbox and has sold millions, broke records, and dominated internet discourse for various reasons. The game has been described as “Pokémon with guns” by some due to the ability to capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls and give them their own guns to use. The game has received a lot of attention since its reveal in 2021, and it finally entered Early Access on PC via Steam and on Xbox in January of 20242\n\n═════════ Video Tags ════════ \npalworld gameplay, palworld guide, palworld tips and tricks, palworld pokemon, palworld best tricks, palworld early game tips, palworld secrets, palworld dungeons, palworld mistakes, palworld best pals, palworld tools, palworld farming, palworld farming tips, palworld speed up eggs, palworld best settings, palworld world settings, palworld unlocks, palworld best secrets, palworld base guide, palworld, pal world, palworld news, palworld update, palworld patch\n\n═════════ Hashtags ═════════\n#Palworld #palworldgame #palworldgameplay",

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Thiago Silva and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Fran Kirby and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard."

Traffic was backed up to National City and CBS 8 coverage showed people standing outside their cars while waiting on the highway. \r\n\r\nIn the same region, homes in Mountain View around S. 42nd St. and Ocean View Boulevard saw massive flooding, after several hours of rain. Cars in the area had their tires mostly or entirely submerged as water flowed south down 42nd Street. Several feet of water mounted in front of a home on the corner of 42nd and Ocean View Boulevard as a river flowed at the back of the house.\r\n\r\nFor the latest weather forecast and alerts:\r\n\r\nCBS 8 online: https://www.cbs8.com/\r\n\r\nCBS 8 weather: https://www.cbs8.com/weather/\r\n\r\nCBS 8 APP: https://www.cbs8.com/app\r\n\r\nNEAR ME | Send us your weather photos and videos: https://www.cbs8.com/near-me\r\n\r\nSign up for the CBS 8 Newsletter: https://www.cbs8.com/email",

We were toying around with the idea of changing our RV to something more suitable for just the two of us, but the timing had to be perfect! After all, we're leaving in late March and will be on the road for most of the year. Once we hit the road, our window for buying and selling an RV would be closed. It's hard to make big changes when we're traveling and dates or events are locked in place. To our surprise, the exact Airstream (and year) we wanted showed up in a new listing, and we immediately called. After discussing price and timing, we decided to change our route to go through Visalia, CA, so we could check it out. We got started with repairs on the first night. During our self-inspection, we knew there was an issue with the voltage. We also identified a few minor issues in other systems. Because we knew we'd likely be modifying these systems anyway, we were not too uptight about it. However, it would have been good to show the \"proper\" process of buying a used RV... and not our approach. We'd like to make a video about buying & selling RVs, so we'll try to include that \"how-to\" information then. Overall, we're thrilled with this new model, and we've already started making small modifications. For those who wondered why we stayed with an Airstream, it's just the most suitable RV for how we travel. It offers us enough space to stay comfortable for months on the road, but it's small enough that we can camp inside the national parks.
