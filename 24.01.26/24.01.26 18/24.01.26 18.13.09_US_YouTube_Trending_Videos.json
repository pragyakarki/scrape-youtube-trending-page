Jason breaks down everything that happened during his time with Bill’s mafia. We touch on everything from what he drank from the bowling ball, what Kylie thought of his decision to go shirtless, and if this was the perfect way to make a first impression. \n\nWe also recap everything else that went down during the divisional round including the Ravens suffocating win over Houston, the Lions, and the Niners pulling out a win against the Packers. \n\nWe will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs AFC Championship game in Baltimore and a full breakdown of the second round of our “Best Team Name” bracket challenge. \n\nMake sure you’re subscribed to the New Heights YouTube Channel and wherever you get your podcasts so you don’t miss out and follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for all the best moments from the show.\n.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights/id1643745036\nSpotify:https://open.spotify.com/show/1y3SUbFMUSESC1N43tBleK?si=LsuQ4a5MRN6wGMcfVcuynw\n\n\nFollow New Heights on Social Media: \nhttp://hoo.be/newheightshow\n\nSupport the Show:  \n\nSupport the Show:  \nMerch - Make sure you check out all the new designs at https://homage.com/newheights\n\nPRIZEPICKS - Go to https://PrizePicks.com/newheights and use code NEWHEIGHTS for a first deposit match up to $100 \n\nEXPERIAN: To get your Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account go to https://Experian.com/Kelce.

I can control time -- freeze and manipulate it to my advantage. This made the puzzles far more tricky and strange than anything I had seen before. Can I beat the time control escape room? Let's find out... \n\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH @Sloimay  and @Wato-1876 for designing the puzzles in this escape room. \n\nalso thanks leowook for having such a good skin for this thumbnail\n\n\n➤➤ Twitter: https://twitter.com/WifiesWasTaken\n➤➤ Discord: https://discord.gg/zAWUuWb\n\n\n➤➤Links: world download for this map in my discord server\n\n\nThis is a series called Minecraft VVSauce where I explore random features of Minecraft. Not Secret Minecraft things or Minecraft lore (like Game Theory) or Escape Rooms, but a research based series dedicated to over-answering questions you never asked."

The game is set in an open world filled with animal-like creatures called Pals. Players can battle and capture Pals to use them for base building, traversal, and combat1. The game was launched into Early Access on PC and Xbox and has sold millions, broke records, and dominated internet discourse for various reasons. The game has been described as “Pokémon with guns” by some due to the ability to capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls and give them their own guns to use. The game has received a lot of attention since its reveal in 2021, and it finally entered Early Access on PC via Steam and on Xbox in January of 20242\n\n═════════ Video Tags ════════ \npalworld gameplay, palworld guide, palworld tips and tricks, palworld pokemon, palworld best tricks, palworld early game tips, palworld secrets, palworld dungeons, palworld mistakes, palworld best pals, palworld tools, palworld farming, palworld farming tips, palworld speed up eggs, palworld best settings, palworld world settings, palworld unlocks, palworld best secrets, palworld base guide, palworld, pal world, palworld news, palworld update, palworld patch\n\n═════════ Hashtags ═════════\n#Palworld #palworldgame #palworldgameplay",

Well, I found my friend, Bobby Parrish, and he’s going to help us find out. \n\n0:00 Introduction: Does Costco have healthy food? \n0:18 Looking for nutritious foods at Costco\n\nToday, we’re going through the aisles of hundreds of items at Costco to hunt down nutritious foods. \n\nGrocery stores are packed with unhealthy, if not dangerous, food items. It's difficult and overwhelming at times to sift through the items and make healthy choices. \n\nWe’re analyzing the nutrition content of a few different foods to help you better understand what to get and what to avoid. \n\nLet me know in the comments which foods you want to learn more about! \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 58, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting. He is the author of the best-selling book The Healthy Keto Plan, and is the Director of Dr. Berg Nutritionals.

It's difficult and overwhelming at times to sift through the items and make healthy choices. \n\nWe’re analyzing the nutrition content of a few different foods to help you better understand what to get and what to avoid. \n\nLet me know in the comments which foods you want to learn more about! \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 58, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree.  Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients so he can focus on educating people as a full time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

We were toying around with the idea of changing our RV to something more suitable for just the two of us, but the timing had to be perfect! After all, we're leaving in late March and will be on the road for most of the year. Once we hit the road, our window for buying and selling an RV would be closed. It's hard to make big changes when we're traveling and dates or events are locked in place. To our surprise, the exact Airstream (and year) we wanted showed up in a new listing, and we immediately called. After discussing price and timing, we decided to change our route to go through Visalia, CA, so we could check it out. We got started with repairs on the first night. During our self-inspection, we knew there was an issue with the voltage. We also identified a few minor issues in other systems. Because we knew we'd likely be modifying these systems anyway, we were not too uptight about it. However, it would have been good to show the \"proper\" process of buying a used RV... and not our approach. We'd like to make a video about buying & selling RVs, so we'll try to include that \"how-to\" information then. Overall, we're thrilled with this new model, and we've already started making small modifications. For those who wondered why we stayed with an Airstream, it's just the most suitable RV for how we travel. It offers us enough space to stay comfortable for months on the road, but it's small enough that we can camp inside the national parks.

It was an insane financial commitment and huge leap of faith that it would be the boat of our dreams.  And ever since that day…we have been preparing for this one.  The day we would go on our first sail aboard CURIOSITY², our spankin’ new HH44. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWE’RE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  \n\nWe've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.\n\nOur journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity\n\nTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:\n\n00:00 Why Visit Hong Kong\n02:05 Marine Store in Hong Kong\n04:51 Best Way to Find Marine Chandlers Around the World\n07:00 Victoria Harbour & Yacht Club\n09:13 Train from Hong Kong to Xiamen\n 11:01 Sea Trial Day from HH Catamarans\n14:08 Raising the Sails for the First Time\n16:31 Running through the Sail Suite \n19:34 Boat Speed & Hydro Generation Performance\n20:23 Sailing in China (Taiwan Straights)\n22:45 Sea Trials is Boat Speak for Solving Issues\n24:18 Super Quick Sailing with the Reacher\n28:45 China’s Special Pink Dolphins\n29:43 Searching for all the Imperfections\n31:42 Adventures at Low Tide\n33:37 What’s Next?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#boatlife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #sailboat #hh44\n\n© Gone With the Wynns 2024"
