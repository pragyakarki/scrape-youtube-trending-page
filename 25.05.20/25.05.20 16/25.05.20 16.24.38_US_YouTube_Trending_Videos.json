Welcome to the world of Minecraft, look for the movie on digital.\n\nFour misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black).

This summer, three years after the Jurassic World trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring Jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nAnchored by iconic action superstar Scarlett Johansson, Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar® winner Mahershala Ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. \n\nAlso starring acclaimed international stars Rupert Friend and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp. \n\nFive years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. \n\nAli is Duncan Kincaid, Zora’s most trusted team member; Critics Choice and Olivier Award winner Jonathan Bailey (Wicked, Bridgerton) plays paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis; Emmy nominee Rupert Friend (Homeland, Obi-Wan Kenobi) appears as Big Pharma representative Martin Krebs and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Murder on the Orient Express) plays Reuben Delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. \n\nThe cast includes Luna Blaise (Manifest), David Iacono (The Summer I Turned Pretty) and Audrina Miranda (Lopez vs. Lopez) as Reuben’s family. The film also features, as members of Zora and Krebs’ crews, Philippine Velge (Station Eleven), Bechir Sylvain (BMF) and Ed Skrein (Deadpool). \n \nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by BAFTA winner Edwards from a script by Koepp (War of the Worlds), based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Oscar® nominee Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, both longtime Jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, Twisters. The film is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Denis L. Stewart and Jim Spencer.",

These were once operational on a college campus, but the operator went out of business, leaving them bricked.  Now, the bike won't turn on, and it's also not possible to access the battery.

Conozca la Virco 9000, un elemento básico de plástico y acero tubular para las aulas que, discretamente, ha moldeado la experiencia de la educación pública durante décadas. Presentada por primera vez en la década de 1960, la Virco 9000 ha vendido más de 60 millones de unidades, lo que la ha convertido en una de las piezas de mobiliario institucional más exitosas de la historia. Este video profundiza en la historia del diseño de las sillas escolares, la evolución del mobiliario de aula de producción en masa y cómo una silla sorprendentemente duradera se convirtió en un elemento nostálgico para millones de estudiantes.\n\nTrazo los orígenes de la silla a través del auge del mobiliario de acero tubular, movimientos de diseño modernistas como la Bauhaus y la Silla Wassily, y las innovaciones de diseñadores como Charles y Ray Eames. A lo largo del camino, exploro cómo las tendencias en educación abierta, los entornos de aprendizaje Montessori y la sobrepoblación en las escuelas públicas de la posguerra crearon las condiciones perfectas para que una silla como la 9000 dominara. Con su carcasa de plástico moldeado, el material del asiento Martest y su estructura apilable, la Virco 9000 no era solo un producto, sino una solución.\n\nPero la verdadera historia reside en el aspecto comercial: las compras escolares, los contratos de compra al por mayor y el poder de las redes de cooperación como OMNIA Partners. Explico cómo Virco aprovechó la fabricación nacional, las estructuras de licitación y la complejidad logística del envío de muebles voluminosos ensamblados para consolidar su presencia en el mercado educativo estadounidense. Si te interesa el diseño industrial, la infraestructura educativa o cómo un solo objeto puede reflejar las fuerzas de la cultura, la política y el comercio, esta es la silla y este el video."

Ecco la Virco 9000, un elemento fondamentale per le aule scolastiche in plastica e acciaio tubolare che ha silenziosamente plasmato l'esperienza dell'istruzione pubblica per decenni. Presentata per la prima volta negli anni '60, la Virco 9000 ha venduto oltre 60 milioni di unità, affermandosi come uno degli arredi istituzionali di maggior successo della storia. Questo video approfondisce la storia del design delle sedie scolastiche, l'evoluzione degli arredi per aule prodotti in serie e come una sedia sorprendentemente resistente sia diventata un punto di riferimento nostalgico per milioni di studenti.\n\nRipercorro le origini della sedia attraverso l'ascesa dei mobili in tubolare d'acciaio, movimenti di design modernisti come il Bauhaus e la Sedia Wassily, e le innovazioni di designer come Charles e Ray Eames. Lungo il percorso, esploro come le tendenze dell'istruzione aperta, gli ambienti di apprendimento Montessori e il sovraffollamento delle scuole pubbliche del dopoguerra abbiano creato le condizioni perfette per il successo di una sedia come la 9000. Con la sua scocca in plastica stampata, il materiale della seduta Martest e il telaio impilabile, la Virco 9000 non era solo un prodotto, ma una soluzione.\n\nMa la vera storia sta nel lato commerciale: gli appalti scolastici, i contratti di acquisto all'ingrosso e la potenza di reti cooperative come OMNIA Partners. Descrivo come Virco abbia sfruttato la produzione nazionale, le strutture di gara d'appalto e la realtà logistica della spedizione di mobili ingombranti e assemblati per costruire una presa incrollabile sul mercato dell'istruzione statunitense. Se siete interessati al design industriale, alle infrastrutture educative o a come un singolo oggetto possa riflettere le forze della cultura, della politica e del commercio, questa è la sedia e questo è il video."

Lernen Sie den Virco 9000 kennen, ein Klassiker aus Kunststoff und Stahlrohr, der seit Jahrzehnten den Unterricht im öffentlichen Bildungswesen prägt. Der Virco 9000 wurde in den 1960er Jahren erstmals vorgestellt und hat sich seitdem über 60 Millionen Mal verkauft. Damit gilt er als eines der erfolgreichsten Möbelstücke für öffentliche Einrichtungen. Dieses Video taucht tief in die Designgeschichte von Schulstühlen ein, zeigt die Entwicklung massenproduzierter Klassenzimmermöbel und wie ein überraschend langlebiger Stuhl für Millionen von Schülern zu einem nostalgischen Anziehungspunkt wurde.\n\nIch verfolge die Ursprünge des Stuhls anhand des Aufstiegs von Stahlrohrmöbeln, modernistischer Designbewegungen wie dem Bauhaus und dem Wassily Chair sowie der Innovationen von Designern wie Charles und Ray Eames. Dabei erkunde ich, wie Trends in der offenen Bildung, Montessori-Lernumgebungen und der Überbelegung öffentlicher Schulen nach dem Krieg die perfekten Voraussetzungen für die Marktführerschaft eines Stuhls wie dem 9000 schufen. Mit seiner geformten Kunststoffschale, dem Martest-Sitzmaterial und dem stapelbaren Gestell war der Virco 9000 nicht nur ein Produkt – er war eine Lösung.\n\nDie eigentliche Geschichte liegt jedoch im Geschäft: Schulbeschaffung, Großabnahmeverträge und die Macht kooperativer Netzwerke wie OMNIA Partners. Ich erkläre, wie Virco die heimische Fertigung, Ausschreibungsstrukturen und die logistische Realität des Versands sperriger Fertigmöbel nutzte, um sich eine unerschütterliche Position auf dem US-Bildungsmarkt zu sichern. Wenn Sie sich für Industriedesign, Bildungsinfrastruktur oder die Frage interessieren, wie ein einzelnes Objekt die Kräfte von Kultur, Politik und Wirtschaft widerspiegeln kann – hier ist der Stuhl und hier das Video."

Temui Virco 9000, kursi kelas berbahan plastik dan baja tubular yang diam-diam telah membentuk pengalaman pendidikan publik selama beberapa dekade. Pertama kali diperkenalkan pada tahun 1960-an, Virco 9000 telah terjual lebih dari 60 juta unit, sehingga menjadikannya salah satu perabot institusional tersukses sepanjang sejarah. Video ini mengupas secara mendalam sejarah desain kursi sekolah, evolusi perabot kelas yang diproduksi secara massal, dan bagaimana satu kursi yang sangat tahan lama menjadi titik kontak yang penuh kenangan bagi jutaan siswa.\n\nSaya menelusuri asal usul kursi melalui munculnya perabot baja tubular, gerakan desain modernis seperti Bauhaus dan Wassily Chair, dan inovasi desainer seperti Charles dan Ray Eames. Sepanjang perjalanan, saya mengeksplorasi bagaimana tren dalam pendidikan terbuka, lingkungan belajar Montessori, dan kepadatan sekolah umum pascaperang menciptakan kondisi yang sempurna bagi kursi seperti 9000 untuk mendominasi. Dengan cangkang plastik cetak, bahan kursi Martest, dan rangka yang dapat ditumpuk, Virco 9000 bukan sekadar produk — melainkan solusi.\n\nNamun, kisah sebenarnya terletak pada sisi bisnis: pengadaan sekolah, kontrak pembelian massal, dan kekuatan jaringan koperasi seperti OMNIA Partners. Saya menguraikan bagaimana Virco memanfaatkan manufaktur dalam negeri, struktur penawaran kontrak, dan realitas logistik pengiriman furnitur rakitan yang besar untuk membangun cengkeraman yang tak tergoyahkan di pasar pendidikan AS. Jika Anda tertarik dengan desain industri, infrastruktur pendidikan, atau bagaimana satu objek dapat mencerminkan kekuatan budaya, kebijakan, dan perdagangan — ini adalah kursinya, dan ini adalah videonya."

Virco 9000 से मिलिए, एक प्लास्टिक और ट्यूबलर स्टील क्लासरूम स्टेपल जिसने दशकों से सार्वजनिक शिक्षा के अनुभव को चुपचाप आकार दिया है। 1960 के दशक में पहली बार पेश किए गए Virco 9000 की 60 मिलियन से ज़्यादा यूनिट बिक चुकी हैं, जिसने इसे इतिहास में संस्थागत फ़र्नीचर के सबसे सफल टुकड़ों में से एक का दर्जा दिलाया है। यह वीडियो स्कूल की कुर्सियों के डिज़ाइन इतिहास, बड़े पैमाने पर उत्पादित कक्षा फ़र्नीचर के विकास और कैसे एक आश्चर्यजनक रूप से टिकाऊ कुर्सी लाखों छात्रों के लिए एक पुरानी यादों का केंद्र बन गई, इस पर गहराई से चर्चा करता है।\n\nमैं ट्यूबलर स्टील फ़र्नीचर के उदय, बॉहॉस और वासिली चेयर जैसे आधुनिक डिज़ाइन आंदोलनों और चार्ल्स और रे ईम्स जैसे डिज़ाइनरों के नवाचारों के ज़रिए कुर्सी की उत्पत्ति का पता लगाता हूँ। साथ ही, मैं यह भी पता लगाता हूँ कि कैसे ओपन एजुकेशन, मोंटेसरी लर्निंग एनवायरनमेंट और युद्ध के बाद के पब्लिक स्कूल में भीड़भाड़ ने 9000 जैसी कुर्सी के लिए सही परिस्थितियाँ बनाईं। अपने मोल्डेड प्लास्टिक शेल, मार्टेस्ट सीट मटेरियल और स्टैकेबल फ़्रेम के साथ, Virco 9000 सिर्फ़ एक उत्पाद नहीं था - यह एक समाधान था।\n\nलेकिन असली कहानी व्यवसाय के पक्ष में है: स्कूल खरीद, थोक खरीद अनुबंध, और ओम्निया पार्टनर्स जैसे सहकारी नेटवर्क की शक्ति। मैं बताता हूँ कि कैसे विरको ने घरेलू विनिर्माण, अनुबंध बोली संरचनाओं, और भारी-भरकम फर्नीचर को शिपिंग करने की तार्किक वास्तविकता का लाभ उठाकर अमेरिकी शिक्षा बाजार पर अपनी पकड़ मजबूत की। यदि आप औद्योगिक डिजाइन, शिक्षा के बुनियादी ढांचे, या एक ही वस्तु संस्कृति, नीति और वाणिज्य की शक्तियों को कैसे प्रतिबिंबित कर सकती है, में रुचि रखते हैं - तो यह कुर्सी है, और यह वीडियो है।"

Conheça a Virco 9000, uma peça essencial para salas de aula, feita de plástico e aço tubular, que molda silenciosamente a experiência da educação pública há décadas. Lançada na década de 1960, a Virco 9000 vendeu mais de 60 milhões de unidades, consolidando-se como uma das peças de mobiliário institucional de maior sucesso da história. Este vídeo mergulha profundamente na história do design de cadeiras escolares, na evolução do mobiliário escolar produzido em massa e em como uma cadeira surpreendentemente durável se tornou um ponto de contato nostálgico para milhões de alunos.\n\nTraço as origens da cadeira através da ascensão do mobiliário tubular de aço, de movimentos de design modernistas como a Bauhaus e a Cadeira Wassily, e das inovações de designers como Charles e Ray Eames. Ao longo do caminho, exploro como as tendências em educação aberta, ambientes de aprendizagem Montessori e a superlotação das escolas públicas do pós-guerra criaram as condições perfeitas para uma cadeira como a 9000 dominar. Com sua estrutura de plástico moldado, assento Martest e estrutura empilhável, a Virco 9000 não era apenas um produto — era uma solução.\n\nMas a verdadeira história está no lado comercial: compras escolares, contratos de compra em massa e o poder de redes cooperativas como a OMNIA Partners. Eu explico como a Virco alavancou a fabricação nacional, as estruturas de licitação de contratos e a realidade logística do transporte de móveis volumosos montados para construir uma posição inabalável no mercado educacional dos EUA. Se você se interessa por design industrial, infraestrutura educacional ou como um único objeto pode refletir as forças da cultura, das políticas públicas e do comércio — esta é a cadeira e este é o vídeo."

J'explore également comment les tendances de l'éducation ouverte, les environnements d'apprentissage Montessori et la surpopulation des écoles publiques d'après-guerre ont créé les conditions idéales pour qu'une chaise comme la 9000 s'impose. Avec sa coque en plastique moulé, son assise en matériau Martest et son cadre empilable, la Virco 9000 n'était pas seulement un produit : c'était une solution.\n\nMais le véritable enjeu réside dans l'aspect commercial : les achats scolaires, les contrats d'achat groupés et la puissance des réseaux coopératifs comme OMNIA Partners. J'explique comment Virco a su tirer parti de la production nationale, des structures d'appel d'offres et de la logistique de l'expédition de meubles volumineux et assemblés pour asseoir sa domination sur le marché américain de l'éducation. Si le design industriel, les infrastructures éducatives ou la façon dont un seul objet peut refléter les forces de la culture, de la politique et du commerce vous intéressent, voici la chaise et la vidéo."

In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind. \n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with composer David Fleming (“The Last of Us”) and editors William Hoy (“The Batman”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).  \n\nDC Studios Presents a Troll Court Entertainment/The Safran Company Production, A James Gunn Film, “Superman,” which will be in theaters and IMAX® nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros.

            "description": "Felix Contreras | May 16, 2025\nCarín León is an old soul. There is no other way to account for the power of the emotion in his voice. His 16-piece band tests the limited space behind the Tiny Desk, but when the brass takes over to punctuate a performance, Leon's commanding presence shows why he's one of the best at what he does.\n\nRegional Mexican music is based upon song forms from another era, but León's lyrics add a new spin on heartbreak and love lost. This set opens with \"Ese Vato No Te Queda,\" followed by two songs from the 2024 album Palabra De To's. Previously, León premiered \"Primera Cita\" for his Tiny Desk (home) concert, which became a major hit. That song \"left a mark on our lives and completely shaped our careers,\" he shares. For good luck, León here premieres \"Por la Suave,\" which was also written by Alejandro Lozano. \"A poem that I love,\" León says.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Ese Vato No Te Queda\"\n\"Lado Frágil\"\n\"El Amor de Mi Herida\"\n\"Por la Suave\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCarín León: vocals\nArturo Garcia: guitar \nLuis Diaz de Leon Huez: guitar\nMiguel Abraham Nayares Moreno: 12-string guitar\nAlan Ortega: dobro \nJavier Humberto Sesma Rivera: tololoche\nDaniel Fuentevilla: keys\nServando Quijada: alto horn\nMarcos Barbosa: alto horn\nSebastián Quintero: saxophone, harmonica, clarinet \nJhonatan Velázquez Villegas: clarinet\nJosé Angel Avila Llunez: trumpet\nIsmael Mendoza: trumpet\nCarlos Leon: trombone\nAbel Anguiano: trombone\nAntonio Zepeda: tuba\nLuis Carlos Pérez: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #carinleon \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

                "description": "Felix Contreras | May 16, 2025\nCarín León is an old soul. There is no other way to account for the power of the emotion in his voice. His 16-piece band tests the limited space behind the Tiny Desk, but when the brass takes over to punctuate a performance, Leon's commanding presence shows why he's one of the best at what he does.\n\nRegional Mexican music is based upon song forms from another era, but León's lyrics add a new spin on heartbreak and love lost. This set opens with \"Ese Vato No Te Queda,\" followed by two songs from the 2024 album Palabra De To's. Previously, León premiered \"Primera Cita\" for his Tiny Desk (home) concert, which became a major hit. That song \"left a mark on our lives and completely shaped our careers,\" he shares. For good luck, León here premieres \"Por la Suave,\" which was also written by Alejandro Lozano. \"A poem that I love,\" León says.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Ese Vato No Te Queda\"\n\"Lado Frágil\"\n\"El Amor de Mi Herida\"\n\"Por la Suave\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCarín León: vocals\nArturo Garcia: guitar \nLuis Diaz de Leon Huez: guitar\nMiguel Abraham Nayares Moreno: 12-string guitar\nAlan Ortega: dobro \nJavier Humberto Sesma Rivera: tololoche\nDaniel Fuentevilla: keys\nServando Quijada: alto horn\nMarcos Barbosa: alto horn\nSebastián Quintero: saxophone, harmonica, clarinet \nJhonatan Velázquez Villegas: clarinet\nJosé Angel Avila Llunez: trumpet\nIsmael Mendoza: trumpet\nCarlos Leon: trombone\nAbel Anguiano: trombone\nAntonio Zepeda: tuba\nLuis Carlos Pérez: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #carinleon \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

The actor opens up for the first time about Mac’s battle with chordoma, a rare, slow-growing spinal cancer, and the strength his son showed throughout his illness: “The way he dealt with it was just pure grace and courage.” He reveals the moment they discovered Mac’s tumor on a CT scan, after months of unexplained pain: “It looks like a monster grabbing my son’s spine.” Gary reflects on a harrowing period that began with his father’s stroke, followed by his wife’s stage 3 breast cancer treatment and his son’s shocking diagnosis — and the decision he made to pause acting to care for them. Mac passed away on January 5, 2024. Gary’s wife is now cancer-free.\n\nHe has continued his work with the Gary Sinise Foundation, which supports veterans, first responders, and their families. Gary recently produced ‘Brothers After War’, a documentary about wounded heroes returning from combat, and is helping release Mac’s final music. The songs are now available, with proceeds going to the Foundation in honor of Mac’s wishes. Gary also shares the joy he finds in being a grandfather, a role that brings light amid the pain.

So, they decide to take their kids (Gage Munroe, Paisley Cadorath) on a short getaway to Wild Bill’s Majestic Midway and Waterpark, the one and only place where Hutch and his brother Harry (Grammy and Emmy nominee RZA) went on a vacation as kids.\n\nWith Hutch’s dad (Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd) in tow, the family arrives in the small tourist town of Plummerville (“Plummerville is Summerville!”), eager for some fun in the sun.\nBut when a minor encounter with some town bullies yanks the family into the crosshairs of a corrupt theme-park operator (John Ortiz; Fast and Furious franchise, Bumblebee) and his shady sheriff (Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Colin Hanks), Hutch finds himself the focus of the most unhinged, blood-thirsty crime boss he (or anyone) has ever encountered (Emmy winning and Oscar® nominated screen icon, Sharon Stone).\n\nNobody 2 is an 87North/Eighty Two Films/Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment\nproduction, directed by Timo Tjahjanto (The Night Comes for Us, The Big 4). The\nscreenplay is by returning writer Derek Kolstad (John Wick, Die Hart) and by Aaron\nRabin (Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan), from a story by Derek Kolstad, based on characters created by Derek Kolstad.
