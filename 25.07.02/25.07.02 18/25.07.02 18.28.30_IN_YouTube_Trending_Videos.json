As parents hold tight to cultural traditions and children chase dreams of freedom, misunderstandings shake the very foundation of the family. It’s a powerful reflection of the emotional battles playing out in households across Pakistan today.\n\n\nSamar Jafri as Wali Jahangir:\nWali, the eldest son of Jahangir, is the emotional heart of Parwarish. Handsome, intelligent, and kind-hearted, Wali was raised in the freedom of America. He dreams of becoming a musician, but his father’s disapproval casts a long shadow. Now back in Pakistan, Wali must navigate a world where parental expectations and personal dreams collide, sparking the drama’s central conflict.\n\nAina Asif as Maya:\nMaya, a bright and determined girl from a conservative, middle-class family, is ready to take on the world. Beautiful and self-assured, she aspires to become a doctor—a path her family supports only conditionally. Caught between love, ambition, and tradition, Maya embodies the struggle of many young women in today’s society.\n\nCast:\nSamar Jafri as Wali Jahangir\nAina Asif as Maya\nNaumaan Ijaz as Jahangir\nSavera Nadeem as Mahnoor\nShamim Hilaly as Dadi\nSaad Zameer Fareedi\nReham Rafiq as Amal\nNazr-ul-Hasan as Shaheer\nBakhtawar Mazhar as Sadia\nNooray Zeeshan as Aania\nHaleema Ali as Mashal\nArshad Mehmood  as Dada\nSaman Ansari\nAbul Hasan & others.\n\nWriter: Kiran Siddiqui\nDirected by: Meesam Naqvi\n \nWatch Parwarish every Monday & Tuesday at 8:00 PM - only on ARY Digital\n\n#parwarish \n#ainaasif \n#samarjafri \n#naumaanijaz \n#saveranadeem \n#arydigital \n#pakistanidrama \n\nPakistani Drama Industry's biggest Platform, ARY Digital, is the Hub of exceptional and uninterrupted entertainment.

As parents hold tight to cultural traditions and children chase dreams of freedom, misunderstandings shake the very foundation of the family. It’s a powerful reflection of the emotional battles playing out in households across Pakistan today.\n\n\nSamar Jafri as Wali Jahangir:\nWali, the eldest son of Jahangir, is the emotional heart of Parwarish. Handsome, intelligent, and kind-hearted, Wali was raised in the freedom of America. He dreams of becoming a musician, but his father’s disapproval casts a long shadow. Now back in Pakistan, Wali must navigate a world where parental expectations and personal dreams collide, sparking the drama’s central conflict.\n\nAina Asif as Maya:\nMaya, a bright and determined girl from a conservative, middle-class family, is ready to take on the world. Beautiful and self-assured, she aspires to become a doctor—a path her family supports only conditionally. Caught between love, ambition, and tradition, Maya embodies the struggle of many young women in today’s society.\n\nCast:\nSamar Jafri as Wali Jahangir\nAina Asif as Maya\nNaumaan Ijaz as Jahangir\nSavera Nadeem as Mahnoor\nShamim Hilaly as Dadi\nSaad Zameer Fareedi\nReham Rafiq as Amal\nNazr-ul-Hasan as Shaheer\nBakhtawar Mazhar as Sadia\nNooray Zeeshan as Aania\nHaleema Ali as Mashal\nArshad Mehmood  as Dada\nSaman Ansari\nAbul Hasan & others.\n\nWriter: Kiran Siddiqui\nDirected by: Meesam Naqvi\n \nWatch Parwarish every Monday & Tuesday at 8:00 PM - only on ARY Digital\n\n#parwarish \n#ainaasif \n#samarjafri \n#naumaanijaz \n#saveranadeem \n#arydigital \n#pakistanidrama \n\nPakistani Drama Industry's biggest Platform, ARY Digital, is the Hub of exceptional and uninterrupted entertainment.

Mix everything well.Heat the oil taken for shortening until it's very hot, and pour it over the flour mixture. First mix using a spoon, then rub it into the flour with your hands thoroughly.Now add the prepared paste, turmeric, white sesame seeds, chopped coriander, and dried fenugreek leaves. Mix well and knead into a stiff dough by adding a little water at a time.After kneading, apply a little oil on the dough and cover it for 10 minutes.\nWhile rolling the puris:Roll one large roti (flatbread) and cut puris using a glass or tumbler, or roll small individual puris and keep ready for frying.\nFrying the puris:Heat oil on medium flame. Once the oil is hot, add a few puris at a time (as many as the pan can hold).

Here, spending just a few extra minutes outside can lead to frostbite, the loss of a limb, or even end of life.\n\nI’m in the coldest inhabited place on Earth, at the coldest time of the year. This is Oymyakon. Just to stay alive, I’m wearing more than 20 layers of clothing, weighing nearly 14 kilos. Stepping outside from a warm 30°C home means facing a temperature drop of over 100 degrees. That’s why I’m also wearing gloves, boots, pants, and a coat, all made from reindeer fur. And even that’s not enough. And now, I’m about to show you what life is like when simply going outside becomes a battle for survival.\n\nThe cold doesn't just affect people and wild animals. It stops everything from functioning.  Phones don’t work properly and often shut down. Cars left outside freeze in just a few hours. Since the ground is always frozen, no fruits or vegetables can grow here.\n\nWe boarded a plane in Moscow, flying east for seven hours to Yakutsk. From there, we covered an 18 hour, 900 kilometer road trip. When we stepped out of the car, it felt like we were on another planet. The hairs in our nose were frozen, and we felt them prick with every breath. The dry air makes us cough uncontrollably.  \n\nOymyakon is home to around 800 people, spread across 1.5 square kilometers. Seeing anyone else outside is almost impossible, the village feels like it has been abandoned.\n\nOur team that worked on this project ► https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vDYIkyfFR1fayrUZOsA80xEN3X-nYhU003F1FewGCy8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSubscribe ► https://goo.gl/MKi8tn\n\"Rediscovery\" Series ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40Eh9f0PRRXcCkyKxrtRvE3tbmcKYvHr\n\nVisiting the Fattest, Most Cigarette-Addicted and Least Visited Country 🇳🇷 ► https://youtu.be/eUJgq9HerDQ\nVisiting the World's Hottest Place (70°C, 159°F) LUT DESERT ► https://youtu.be/NhyDkHaUC8U\nVisiting the World’s Most Daпgeгous Road: “Karakoram D℮ath Road” (There are casuaIti℮s!) ► https://youtu.be/FryCzL17YRs\nVisiting the MOST AIR POLLUTED CITY in the World (Dust Hell) ► https://youtu.be/zC4saZg6sG0\nVisiting the COLDEST CITY in the World (-71°C, -96°F) YAKUTSK / YAKUTIA ► https://youtu.be/Fz4ZMLsPzqM\n8 Crazy Experiments at -55°C, -67°F (The coldest city in the World: Yakutsk) ► https://youtu.be/ExoOL2lwlWE\nWorld's Poorest Country \"Burundi\" (I can’t forget the things I saw) ► https://youtu.be/n0gFsHf9cIw\n\nMy name is Ruhi Çenet, I'm an independent documentary maker.

Melangkah keluar dari rumah yang hangat bersuhu 30°C berarti menghadapi penurunan suhu lebih dari 100 derajat. Itu sebabnya saya juga mengenakan sarung tangan, sepatu bot, celana, dan mantel, yang semuanya terbuat dari bulu rusa kutub. Itu pun belum cukup. Dan sekarang, saya akan menunjukkan kepada Anda seperti apa kehidupan saat sekadar keluar rumah menjadi pertempuran untuk bertahan hidup.\n\nCuaca dingin tidak hanya memengaruhi manusia dan hewan liar. Cuaca dingin menghentikan semua fungsi. Ponsel tidak berfungsi dengan baik dan sering mati. Mobil yang ditinggal di luar membeku hanya dalam beberapa jam. Karena tanah selalu beku, tidak ada buah atau sayuran yang dapat tumbuh di sini.\n\nKami naik pesawat di Moskow, terbang ke timur selama tujuh jam menuju Yakutsk. Dari sana, kami menempuh perjalanan darat selama 18 jam, sejauh 900 kilometer. Saat kami keluar dari mobil, rasanya seperti berada di planet lain. Bulu hidung kami membeku, dan kami merasakannya menusuk setiap kali bernapas. Udara kering membuat kami batuk-batuk tak terkendali.\n\nOymyakon adalah rumah bagi sekitar 800 orang, tersebar di wilayah seluas 1,5 kilometer persegi. Hampir mustahil untuk melihat orang lain di luar, desa itu terasa seperti telah ditinggalkan.\n\nTim kami yang mengerjakan proyek ini: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOPAk_iEyW2ykhtBRo4g4X3kFq44Uny9H50L970WFoo/edit?usp=sharing\n\nBerlangganan ► https://goo.gl/MKi8tn\nSeri \"Penemuan Kembali\" ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40Eh9f0PRRXcCkyKxrtRvE3tbmcKYvHr\n\nMengunjungi Negara Paling Gemuk, Paling Banyak Kecanduan Rokok, dan Paling Jarang Dikunjungi 🇳🇷 ► https://youtu.be/eUJgq9HerDQ\nMengunjungi Tempat Terpanas di Dunia (70°C, 159°F) GURUN LUT ► https://youtu.be/NhyDkHaUC8U\nMengunjungi Jalan Paling Berbahaya di Dunia: \"Jalan Karakoram D℮ath\" (Ada beberapa kejadian!) ► https://youtu.be/FryCzL17YRs\nMengunjungi KOTA PALING TERPOLUSI UDARA di Dunia (Dust Hell) ► https://youtu.be/zC4saZg6sG0\nMengunjungi KOTA TERDINGIN di Dunia (-71°C, -96°F) YAKUTSK / YAKUTIA ► https://youtu.be/Fz4ZMLsPzqM\n8 Eksperimen Gila pada suhu -55°C, -67°F (Kota terdingin di Dunia: Yakutsk) ► https://youtu.be/ExoOL2lwlWE\nNegara Termiskin di Dunia \"Burundi\" (Saya tidak bisa melupakan hal-hal yang saya lihat) ► https://youtu.be/n0gFsHf9cIw\n\nNama saya Ruhi Çenet, saya seorang pembuat film dokumenter independen.

Qui, trascorrere solo pochi minuti in più all'aperto può portare a congelamenti, alla perdita di un arto o persino alla fine della vita.\n\nMi trovo nel luogo abitato più freddo della Terra, nel periodo più freddo dell'anno. Questa è Oymyakon. Solo per sopravvivere, indosso più di 20 strati di vestiti, per un peso di quasi 14 chili. Uscire da una casa calda a 30 °C significa affrontare un calo di temperatura di oltre 38 gradi. Ecco perché indosso anche guanti, stivali, pantaloni e un cappotto, tutti di pelliccia di renna. E anche questo non basta. E ora sto per mostrarvi com'è la vita quando semplicemente uscire diventa una lotta per la sopravvivenza.\n\nIl freddo non colpisce solo le persone e gli animali selvatici. Impedisce a tutto di funzionare. I telefoni non funzionano correttamente e spesso si spengono. Le auto lasciate fuori si congelano in poche ore. Dato che il terreno è sempre ghiacciato, qui non cresce né frutta né verdura.\n\nSiamo saliti su un aereo a Mosca, volando verso est per sette ore fino a Yakutsk. Da lì, abbiamo percorso 900 chilometri in auto per 18 ore. Quando siamo scesi dall'auto, ci siamo sentiti come su un altro pianeta. I peli del naso erano congelati e li sentivamo pungere a ogni respiro. L'aria secca ci fa tossire in modo incontrollabile.\n\nOymyakon ospita circa 800 persone, distribuite su 1,5 chilometri quadrati. Vedere qualcun altro all'esterno è quasi impossibile, il villaggio sembra abbandonato.\n\nIl nostro team che ha lavorato a questo progetto: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/11qq9V_BIiduZjUXV29TbML_HhdIacpP_j9mEj5QwWKI/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIscriviti ► https://goo.gl/MKi8tn\nSerie \"Riscoperta\" ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40Eh9f0PRRXcCkyKxrtRvE3tbmcKYvHr\n\nVisitare il Paese più grasso, più dipendente dalle sigarette e meno visitato 🇳🇷 ► https://youtu.be/eUJgq9HerDQ\nVisitare il luogo più caldo del mondo (70 °C, 159 °F) nel deserto di LUT ► https://youtu.be/NhyDkHaUC8U\nVisitare la strada più pericolosa del mondo: la \"Karakoram Death Road\" (Ci sono incidenti!) ► https://youtu.be/FryCzL17YRs\nVisitare il LA CITTÀ PIÙ INQUINATA del mondo (Inferno di polvere) ► https://youtu.be/zC4saZg6sG0\nVisitare la CITTÀ PIÙ FREDDA del mondo (-71 °C, -96 °F) YAKUTSK / YAKUTIA ► https://youtu.be/Fz4ZMLsPzqM\n8 esperimenti folli a -55 °C, -67 °F (La città più fredda del mondo: Yakutsk) ► https://youtu.be/ExoOL2lwlWE\nIl paese più povero del mondo, il Burundi (Non riesco a dimenticare le cose che ho visto) ► https://youtu.be/n0gFsHf9cIw\n\nMi chiamo Ruhi Çenet e sono un documentarista indipendente.

And even that’s not enough. And now, I’m about to show you what life is like when simply going outside becomes a battle for survival.\n\nThe cold doesn't just affect people and wild animals. It stops everything from functioning.  Phones don’t work properly and often shut down. Cars left outside freeze in just a few hours. Since the ground is always frozen, no fruits or vegetables can grow here.\n\nWe boarded a plane in Moscow, flying east for seven hours to Yakutsk. From there, we covered an 18 hour, 900 kilometer road trip. When we stepped out of the car, it felt like we were on another planet.

Он останавливает все. Телефоны не работают должным образом и часто выключаются. Машины, оставленные снаружи, замерзают всего за несколько часов.

Aqui, passar apenas alguns minutos a mais ao ar livre pode levar a queimaduras de frio, à perda de um membro ou até mesmo ao fim da vida.\n\nEstou no lugar habitado mais frio da Terra, na época mais fria do ano. Este é Oymyakon. Só para me manter vivo, estou usando mais de 20 camadas de roupa e pesando quase 14 quilos. Sair de uma casa quente a 30°C significa enfrentar uma queda de temperatura de mais de 38°C. É por isso que também estou usando luvas, botas, calças e um casaco, todos feitos de pele de rena. E mesmo isso não é suficiente. E agora, estou prestes a mostrar como é a vida quando simplesmente sair de casa se torna uma batalha pela sobrevivência.\n\nO frio não afeta apenas pessoas e animais selvagens. Ele impede que tudo funcione. Os celulares não funcionam direito e frequentemente desligam. Carros deixados do lado de fora congelam em poucas horas. Como o solo está sempre congelado, nenhuma fruta ou verdura pode crescer aqui.\n\nEmbarcamos em um avião em Moscou, voando para o leste por sete horas até Yakutsk. De lá, percorremos uma viagem de 18 horas e 900 quilômetros. Quando saímos do carro, parecia que estávamos em outro planeta. Os pelos do nosso nariz estavam congelados e sentíamos que eles se eriçavam a cada respiração. O ar seco nos faz tossir incontrolavelmente.\n\nOymyakon abriga cerca de 800 pessoas, espalhadas por 1,5 quilômetro quadrado. Ver alguém do lado de fora é quase impossível; a vila parece abandonada.\n\nNossa equipe que trabalhou neste projeto: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FkL9B_ao4Yh8Jp9mSKv-7zonDGqjfM_fTPw6fEICUDw/edit?usp=sharing\n\nInscreva-se ► https://goo.gl/MKi8tn\nSérie \"Redescobrimento\" ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40Eh9f0PRRXcCkyKxrtRvE3tbmcKYvHr\n\nVisitando o país mais gordo, mais viciado em cigarro e menos visitado 🇳🇷 ► https://youtu.be/eUJgq9HerDQ\nVisitando o lugar mais quente do mundo (70°C, 159°F) DESERTO DE LUT ► https://youtu.be/NhyDkHaUC8U\nVisitando a estrada mais perigosa do mundo: “Estrada da Morte de Karakoram” (Existem casos!) ► https://youtu.be/FryCzL17YRs\nVisitando o MAIS CIDADE COM AR POLIDO do Mundo (Inferno de Poeira) ► https://youtu.be/zC4saZg6sG0\nVisitando a CIDADE MAIS FRIA do Mundo (-71°C, -96°F) YAKUTSK / YAKUTIA ► https://youtu.be/Fz4ZMLsPzqM\n8 Experimentos Malucos a -55°C, -67°F (A cidade mais fria do mundo: Yakutsk) ► https://youtu.be/ExoOL2lwlWE\nO país mais pobre do mundo, \"Burundi\" (Não consigo esquecer as coisas que vi) ► https://youtu.be/n0gFsHf9cIw\n\nMeu nome é Ruhi Çenet e sou documentarista independente.

Tutaj spędzenie kilku dodatkowych minut na zewnątrz może doprowadzić do odmrożeń, utraty kończyny, a nawet końca życia.\n\nJestem w najzimniejszym zamieszkanym miejscu na Ziemi, w najzimniejszej porze roku. To jest Ojmiakon. Aby przeżyć, noszę ponad 20 warstw ubrań, ważąc prawie 14 kilogramów. Wyjście z ciepłego domu o temperaturze 30°C oznacza spadek temperatury o ponad 100 stopni. Dlatego noszę również rękawiczki, buty, spodnie i płaszcz, wszystko z futra renifera. I nawet to nie wystarczy. A teraz pokażę wam, jak wygląda życie, gdy samo wyjście na zewnątrz staje się walką o przetrwanie.\n\nZimno nie dotyczy tylko ludzi i dzikich zwierząt. Uniemożliwia działanie wszystkiego. Telefony nie działają prawidłowo i często się wyłączają. Samochody pozostawione na zewnątrz zamarzają w ciągu kilku godzin. Ponieważ ziemia jest zawsze zamarznięta, nie mogą tu rosnąć żadne owoce ani warzywa.\n\nWsiedliśmy do samolotu w Moskwie, lecieliśmy na wschód przez siedem godzin do Jakucka. Stamtąd pokonaliśmy 18-godzinną, 900-kilometrową podróż. Kiedy wysiedliśmy z samochodu, poczuliśmy się, jakbyśmy byli na innej planecie. Włosy w nosie zamarzły i czuliśmy, jak kłują przy każdym oddechu. Suche powietrze sprawia, że ​​kaszlemy niekontrolowanie.\n\nOymyakon jest domem dla około 800 osób, rozsianych na obszarze 1,5 kilometra kwadratowego.

Đây là Oymyakon. Chỉ để sống sót, tôi phải mặc hơn 20 lớp quần áo, nặng gần 14 kg. Bước ra khỏi ngôi nhà ấm áp 30°C có nghĩa là phải đối mặt với nhiệt độ giảm hơn 100 độ. Đó là lý do tại sao tôi cũng phải đeo găng tay, ủng, quần và áo khoác, tất cả đều làm từ lông tuần lộc. Và thậm chí như vậy vẫn chưa đủ. Và bây giờ, tôi sắp cho bạn thấy cuộc sống như thế nào khi chỉ cần ra ngoài cũng trở thành cuộc chiến sinh tồn.\n\nCái lạnh không chỉ ảnh hưởng đến con người và động vật hoang dã. Nó ngăn mọi thứ hoạt động. Điện thoại không hoạt động bình thường và thường xuyên tắt máy. Những chiếc ô tô để bên ngoài sẽ đóng băng chỉ sau vài giờ. Vì mặt đất luôn đóng băng nên không có loại trái cây hoặc rau quả nào có thể phát triển ở đây.\n\nChúng tôi lên máy bay ở Moscow, bay về phía đông trong bảy giờ đến Yakutsk. Từ đó, chúng tôi đã thực hiện chuyến đi đường dài 18 giờ, dài 900 km. Khi bước ra khỏi xe, chúng tôi cảm thấy như mình đang ở một hành tinh khác. Những sợi lông trên mũi chúng tôi bị đóng băng và chúng tôi cảm thấy chúng nhói lên với mỗi hơi thở. Không khí khô khiến chúng tôi ho không kiểm soát được.\n\nOymyakon là nơi sinh sống của khoảng 800 người, trải rộng trên diện tích 1,5 km vuông.

Aquí, pasar tan solo unos minutos de más al aire libre puede provocar congelación, la pérdida de una extremidad o incluso la muerte.\n\nEstoy en el lugar habitado más frío de la Tierra, en la época más fría del año. Esto es Oimiakón. Solo para sobrevivir, llevo más de 20 capas de ropa y peso casi 14 kilos. Salir de una casa con una temperatura cálida de 30 °C significa enfrentarme a una caída de temperatura de más de 100 grados. Por eso también llevo guantes, botas, pantalones y un abrigo, todo hecho de piel de reno. Y ni siquiera eso es suficiente. Y ahora, estoy a punto de mostrarles cómo es la vida cuando simplemente salir se convierte en una batalla por la supervivencia.\n\nEl frío no solo afecta a las personas y a los animales salvajes. Impide que todo funcione. Los teléfonos no funcionan correctamente y a menudo se apagan. Los coches que se dejan a la intemperie se congelan en pocas horas. Como el suelo siempre está helado, aquí no crecen frutas ni verduras.\n\nSubimos a un avión en Moscú, volando hacia el este durante siete horas hasta Yakutsk. Desde allí, hicimos un viaje por carretera de 18 horas y 900 kilómetros. Al bajar del coche, nos sentimos como en otro planeta. Teníamos los pelos de la nariz congelados y los sentíamos punzar con cada respiración. El aire seco nos hace toser sin control.\n\nOimiakón alberga a unas 800 personas, repartidas en 1,5 kilómetros cuadrados. Ver a alguien fuera es casi imposible; el pueblo parece abandonado.\n\nNuestro equipo que trabajó en este proyecto: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1z3tRij3We0s3hkDnfqgrpDmcawV5EwicHfw5D9KsY2Q/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSuscríbete ► https://goo.gl/MKi8tn\nSerie \"Redescubrimiento\" ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40Eh9f0PRRXcCkyKxrtRvE3tbmcKYvHr\n\nVisita al país más gordo, con más adicciones al tabaco y menos visitado 🇳🇷 ► https://youtu.be/eUJgq9HerDQ\nVisita al lugar más caluroso del mundo (70 °C, 159 °F): el desierto de Tayikistán ► https://youtu.be/NhyDkHaUC8U\nVisita la carretera más peligrosa del mundo: la \"Carretera de la Muerte del Karakórum\" (¡Hay accidentes!) ► https://youtu.be/FryCzL17YRs\nVisita al LA CIUDAD MÁS CONTAMINADA DEL AIRE DEL MUNDO (Infierno de Polvo) ► https://youtu.be/zC4saZg6sG0\nVisita la CIUDAD MÁS FRÍA del mundo (-71 °C, -96 °F): YAKUTSK / YAKUTIA ► https://youtu.be/Fz4ZMLsPzqM\n8 Experimentos Locos a -55 °C, -67 °F (La ciudad más fría del mundo: Yakutsk) ► https://youtu.be/ExoOL2lwlWE\nBurundi, el país más pobre del mundo (No puedo olvidar lo que vi) ► https://youtu.be/n0gFsHf9cIw\n\nMe llamo Ruhi Çenet y soy documentalista independiente.

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham.

This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu.

So, get your daily dose of laughter with Jethalal, Taarak Mehta, Daya, Champaklal and their neighbors in Gokuldham Society.\n\nAbout Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe show is inspired from the famous humorous column 'Duniya Ne Undha Chasma' written by the eminent Gujarati writer Mr. Tarak Mehta. This story revolves around daily happenings in \"Gokuldham Co-operative Society\" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant. The show predominantly - revolves around 'Jethalal' who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta', is his neighbor. 'Jethalal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' and a mischievous son 'Tapu'. Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son push Jethalal' to call his father 'Champaklal' from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu. The opposite happens and the grandfather joins hands with the grandson to make life a roller coaster troublesome ride for Jethalal.\n\nCast:\n---------\nDilip Joshi as Jethalal Champaklal Gada\nDisha Vakani as Daya Jethalal Gada\nNitish Bhaluni / Raj Anadkat / Bhavya Gandhi as Tipendra Jethalal Gada (Tapu) \nAmit Bhatt as Champaklal Jayantilal Gada\nSachin Shroff / Shailesh Lodha as Taarak Mehta\nSunayana Fozdar / Neha Mehta as Anjali Taarak Mehta\nTanuj Mahashabde as Krishnan Subramaniam Iyer\nMunmun Dutta as Babita Krishnan Iyer\nMandar Chandwadkar as Aatmaram Tukaram Bhide\nSonalika Joshi as Madhvi Aatmaram Bhide\nJheel Mehta / Nidhi Bhanushali / Palak Sidhwani / Khushi Mali as Sonalika Aatmaram Bhide (Sonu) \nGurucharan Singh/ Balwinder Suri as Roshan Singh Harjeet Singh Sodhi\nJennifer Mistry Bansiwal / Monaz Mevawalla as Roshan Kaur Roshan Singh Sodhi\nKavi Kumar Azad / Nirmal Soni as Dr. Hansraj Hathi \nAmbika Ranjankar as Komal Hansraj Hathi\nKush Shah / Dharmit Shah as Gulabkumar Hansraj Hathi (Goli)\nShyam Pathak as Popatlal Pandey\nSharad Sankla as Abdul\nAzhar Shaikh as Pinku \nGhanshyam Nayak / Kiran Bhatt as Nattu Kaka\nTanmay Vekaria as Bagha\nNavina Wadekar / Monika Bhadoriya as Bawri\n\nProduced By: Neela Asit Modi, Asit Kumarr Modi \nSpecial Thanks: Mahesh Vakil, Indu Tarak Mehta\nSet Design: Jayant Deshmukh\nOn-Air Promotion  ( SAB): SAB OAP\nCostume Designer: Alka Mehta\nCostume Stylist: Ekta Brahmbhatt\nCameraman: Aamir Virani\nProduction Head: Arvind Marchande\nProduction Controler: Vinod Shishupal\nBackground Music: Sunil Patni\nOnline Editors: Vishal Tambe, Sandeep Singh \nExecutive Producer: Jatin Yogesh Bajaj\nEditor: Dinesh Gosavi, Kaushal Mistry, Devang Modi, Vinod Maurya\nCreative Supervision: Krunal Khakhkhar\nOperation Head: Sohil Ramani\nWritten By: Raju Odedra & Rajen Upadhyay\nDirectors: Harshad Joshi, Malav Suresh Rajda\n\nTelevision Adaptation and Designed By: Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nMore Useful Links :\n * Like us on Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/tmkoc.sabtv\n* Follow us on Instagram : http://www.instagram.com/taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp\n * Follow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/tmkoc_ntf\n* Visit us at : http://www.tmkoc.com\n\n#tmkoc #taarakmehta #tmkocsmileofindia"
