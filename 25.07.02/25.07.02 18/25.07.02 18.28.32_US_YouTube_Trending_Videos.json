            "description": "Iran has warned Donald Trump that there will be a response to the US bombing of three key nuclear enrichment facilities.  \n\nIran's foreign minister warned of \"everlasting consequences\" to the \"outrageous\" strikes.   Its elite military force, the Revolutionary Guard, warned that US bases and forces in the region were “vulnerable”.     Iran’s Parliament backed the closure of the Strait of Hormuz - a key transit route for global oil supplies. S\n\nIran’s immediate response was to fire a new barrage of missiles at Israel, which began the war when it attacked Iran’s nuclear sites ten days ago.   Iranian missiles hit residential buildings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, injuring around 80 people. \n\nPresident Donald Trump claimed the US strikes had “totally obliterated\" Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, and told Tehran to \"make peace\" or face \"far greater\" attacks in future. \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Gordon Corera, Faisal Islam, Chris Mason, Siavash Ardalan, Orla Guerin, Lucy Williamson and Lyse Doucet. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                "description": "Iran has warned Donald Trump that there will be a response to the US bombing of three key nuclear enrichment facilities.  \n\nIran's foreign minister warned of \"everlasting consequences\" to the \"outrageous\" strikes.   Its elite military force, the Revolutionary Guard, warned that US bases and forces in the region were “vulnerable”.     Iran’s Parliament backed the closure of the Strait of Hormuz - a key transit route for global oil supplies. S\n\nIran’s immediate response was to fire a new barrage of missiles at Israel, which began the war when it attacked Iran’s nuclear sites ten days ago.   Iranian missiles hit residential buildings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, injuring around 80 people. \n\nPresident Donald Trump claimed the US strikes had “totally obliterated\" Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, and told Tehran to \"make peace\" or face \"far greater\" attacks in future. \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Gordon Corera, Faisal Islam, Chris Mason, Siavash Ardalan, Orla Guerin, Lucy Williamson and Lyse Doucet. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

            "description": "FNaF World is one of my favorite free games ever made, but unfortunately my bank account is in the negative so I can’t afford anything free anymore. I went to Vegas last month and bet my entire savings account (and then some!) on black, thinking my YouTuber luck would carry over. Spoiler alert, it didn’t. Thankfully, I can still play the FNaF World Demo even though I’m in debt, so here I am trying to figure out a way to make content out of it. I guess I haven’t made the obligatory 100%ing FNaF World video yet like everyone else, so now I’ve decided to try and 100% the game with the added twist of doing it inside of the FNaF World Demo. This seems a lot simpler than it truly was however, as many literal barriers are found within the world halting your progress, and you can’t even use most of the characters! I would say if this video does well I can pay off my debts, but I actually think I already have in the process of making this! I think my terrible luck with pokemon cards finally decided to go away, as the other day I opened a booster bundle of Prismatic Evolutions and pulled a beautiful Eevee EX SIR, which is worth about 140 dollars. I haven’t really told any of my friends that I pulled the card though, so if you’re reading this I guess you’ve got some elite TheDapperWaffle knowledge to totally impress your friends!

                "title": "Can You 100% FNaF World Inside The DEMO?",
                "description": "FNaF World is one of my favorite free games ever made, but unfortunately my bank account is in the negative so I can’t afford anything free anymore. I went to Vegas last month and bet my entire savings account (and then some!) on black, thinking my YouTuber luck would carry over. Spoiler alert, it didn’t. Thankfully, I can still play the FNaF World Demo even though I’m in debt, so here I am trying to figure out a way to make content out of it. I guess I haven’t made the obligatory 100%ing FNaF World video yet like everyone else, so now I’ve decided to try and 100% the game with the added twist of doing it inside of the FNaF World Demo. This seems a lot simpler than it truly was however, as many literal barriers are found within the world halting your progress, and you can’t even use most of the characters! I would say if this video does well I can pay off my debts, but I actually think I already have in the process of making this! I think my terrible luck with pokemon cards finally decided to go away, as the other day I opened a booster bundle of Prismatic Evolutions and pulled a beautiful Eevee EX SIR, which is worth about 140 dollars. I haven’t really told any of my friends that I pulled the card though, so if you’re reading this I guess you’ve got some elite TheDapperWaffle knowledge to totally impress your friends! By the way if you even bothered to look at this description, write the comment “I am quite fond of DeeDee’s fishing hole” so I know you’re a real one, thanks!\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 - Prologue\n2:16 - Chapter 1 (I’m Gonna Play UCN!)\n4:05 - Chapter 2 (ok let’s start for real :))\n7:41 - Chapter 3 (The Barrier Problem!)\n11:17 - Chapter 4 (Subverting the Status Quo)\n15:26 - Chapter 5 (CBT)\n23:50 - Chapter 6 (TRIPLE TROPHY TROUBLE)\n29:56 - Chapter 7 (Yes, For Real!)\n\nCREDITS:\nTheDapperWaffle: Gameplay, script writing, editing, art, all that stuff.\nhttps://x.com/TheDapperWaffle\n\nAm_Person: Helped me get out of my emo phase towards the end of the video, and also helped me come up with the idea for this video in the first place! Huge shoutouts to them! :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@am_person8311\n\nVarikSB: Making me realize that I needed to stop milking FNaF World and play another game instead. This worked for 2 whole minutes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@variksb\n\nwhotookfinn: Created all the art featured on the thumbnail! It’s probably my favorite thumbnail so far, so massive shoutouts to him!\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@whotookfinn?_t=8qO7i49cAdn&_r=1\n\nTheBones5: Unfortunately I must come clean.

The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.

As he rampages through the city, swallowing Sprunkis and converting them into grotesque pawns, his wrath draws the attention of Gray, a former bystander desperate to stop the destruction.

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialMusicVideo",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialMusicVideo"

It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­-to-­be­-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #RobloxForsaken #Forsaken #RobloxHorror #Horror #xDemon #Goobers",
