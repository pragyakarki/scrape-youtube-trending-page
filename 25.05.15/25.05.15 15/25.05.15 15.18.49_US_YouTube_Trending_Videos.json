In his signature style, James Gunn takes on the original superhero in the newly imagined DC universe with a singular blend of epic action, humor and heart, delivering a Superman who’s driven by compassion and an inherent belief in the goodness of humankind. \n\nDC Studios heads Peter Safran and Gunn are producing the film, which Gunn directs from his own screenplay, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.\n\nThe film stars David Corenswet (“Twisters,” “Hollywood”) in the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”) as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult (the “X-Men” movies, “Juror #2”) as Lex Luthor.  The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n\n“Superman” is executive produced by Nikolas Korda, Chantal Nong Vo and Lars Winther.  Behind the camera, Gunn is joined by frequent collaborators, including director of photography Henry Braham, production designer Beth Mickle, costume designer Judianna Makovsky and composer John Murphy, along with composer David Fleming (“The Last of Us”) and editors William Hoy (“The Batman”) and Craig Alpert (“Deadpool 2,” “Blue Beetle”).  \n\nDC Studios Presents a Troll Court Entertainment/The Safran Company Production, A James Gunn Film, “Superman,” which will be in theaters and IMAX® nationwide on July 11, 2025, and internationally beginning 9 July 2025, distributed by Warner Bros.

The actor opens up for the first time about Mac’s battle with chordoma, a rare, slow-growing spinal cancer, and the strength his son showed throughout his illness: “The way he dealt with it was just pure grace and courage.” He reveals the moment they discovered Mac’s tumor on a CT scan, after months of unexplained pain: “It looks like a monster grabbing my son’s spine.” Gary reflects on a harrowing period that began with his father’s stroke, followed by his wife’s stage 3 breast cancer treatment and his son’s shocking diagnosis — and the decision he made to pause acting to care for them. Mac passed away on January 5, 2024. Gary’s wife is now cancer-free.\n\nHe has continued his work with the Gary Sinise Foundation, which supports veterans, first responders, and their families. Gary recently produced ‘Brothers After War’, a documentary about wounded heroes returning from combat, and is helping release Mac’s final music. The songs are now available, with proceeds going to the Foundation in honor of Mac’s wishes. Gary also shares the joy he finds in being a grandfather, a role that brings light amid the pain.

            "description": "Nobody ruins his vacation. #Nobody2 hits theaters August 15.\n\n---\nSometimes the most dangerous place for a dad is a family vacation.\n\nBob Odenkirk returns as suburban husband, father and workaholic assassin Hutch\nMansell in the new chapter to Nobody, the hit 2021 bare-knuckle action-thriller that\nopened at number one at the U.S. box office.\n\nFour years after he inadvertently took on the Russian mob, Hutch remains $30 million in debt to the criminal organization and is working it off with an unending string of hits on international thugs.\n\nMuch as he likes the slam-bang action of his “job,” Hutch and his wife Becca\n(International Emmy nominee Connie Nielsen) find themselves overworked and drifting apart. So, they decide to take their kids (Gage Munroe, Paisley Cadorath) on a short getaway to Wild Bill’s Majestic Midway and Waterpark, the one and only place where Hutch and his brother Harry (Grammy and Emmy nominee RZA) went on a vacation as kids.\n\nWith Hutch’s dad (Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd) in tow, the family arrives in the small tourist town of Plummerville (“Plummerville is Summerville!”), eager for some fun in the sun.\nBut when a minor encounter with some town bullies yanks the family into the crosshairs of a corrupt theme-park operator (John Ortiz; Fast and Furious franchise, Bumblebee) and his shady sheriff (Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Colin Hanks), Hutch finds himself the focus of the most unhinged, blood-thirsty crime boss he (or anyone) has ever encountered (Emmy winning and Oscar® nominated screen icon, Sharon Stone).\n\nNobody 2 is an 87North/Eighty Two Films/Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment\nproduction, directed by Timo Tjahjanto (The Night Comes for Us, The Big 4). The\nscreenplay is by returning writer Derek Kolstad (John Wick, Die Hart) and by Aaron\nRabin (Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan), from a story by Derek Kolstad, based on characters created by Derek Kolstad. This film’s returning producers are 87North founders Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, The Fall Guy) and David Leitch (Bullet Train, The Fall Guy); Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment founder Marc Provissiero (No Hard Feelings, PEN15), Eighty Two Films founder Braden Aftergood (Hell or High Water, Samaritan); and Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad).

The film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Kosinski, seven-time FORMULA 1® world champion Lewis Hamilton, Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Chad Oman.\n\nDubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1’s most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.  Thirty years later, he’s a nomadic racer-for-hire when he’s approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling FORMULA 1 team that is on the verge of collapse.  Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.  He’ll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace.  But as the engines roar, Sonny’s past catches up with him and he finds that in FORMULA 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.\n\nF1® The Movie also stars Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Kim Bodnia, and Javier Bardem, and was shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competed against the titans of the sport.\n\nKosinski directs from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger, story by Kosinski & Kruger.  The film is executive produced by Daniel Lupi.  Collaborating with Kosinski behind the scenes are his creative team, including director of photography Claudio Miranda, production designers Mark Tildesley and Ben Munro, editor Stephen Mirrione, costume designer Julian Day, casting director Lucy Bevan and composer Hans Zimmer.\n\nApple Original Films and Warner Bros.

La Caterham, quant à elle, est équipée d'un moteur Ford Duratec suralimenté associé à une boîte manuelle à 5 rapports.

Tenaga yang ringan mungkin menjadi tujuannya, tetapi Atom menggunakan mesin Civic Type R dengan turbocharger besar dan banyak kustomisasi mode berkendara. Sementara Caterham menggunakan mesin Ford Duratec supercharged yang dikombinasikan dengan opsi manual 5-percepatan. Masing-masing memiliki cara sendiri untuk membuat Anda tersenyum, dan dalam episode ini, James sangat senang bisa bergabung dengan Jack Scarlett sebagai pembawa acara spesial.

Para equilibrar a ingestão calórica dos desafios alimentares semanais, continuo a perseguir meu amor pelo fitness por meio da musculação, corrida e spinning.\n\nPerguntas frequentes:\n**Como não engordar?**\nConfira minha playlist \"Dieta Diária\" aqui: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjzJq-PMUB7ovX5rYVzA1GITfvCtq3P3\n\n**Por que você treme tanto?**\nTenho uma condição genética conhecida como \"tremores não essenciais\". Isso, combinado com o nervosismo, a fome com a baixa glicemia e uma profunda paixão pela cafeína, torna o início de um desafio um tanto agitado.\n\n**Você e Randy são casados?**\nNão, ainda não! Ficamos noivos em 1º de dezembro de 2024 e estamos animados para o futuro!"

Unaware of what awaits them in each wax-sealed envelope, only one competitor can become the victorious owner of His Royal Task-ness’ golden head and be crowned the next Taskmaster Champion.\n\n#Taskmaster #Comedy #GregDavies #AlexHorne"

                "description": "Cardinal Robert Prevost, an American missionary who spent his career ministering in Peru and leads the Vatican’s powerful office of bishops, was elected the first American pope in the 2,000-year history of the Catholic Church. Prevost, 69, took the name Leo XIV.\n\nWhite smoke poured out of the Sistine Chapel chimney Thursday at 6:07 p.m. local time, signaling that a pontiff had been elected to lead the Catholic Church.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc. The AP is solely responsible for this content.\n\nAP journalists are on the ground in Vatican City all week covering the papal conclave. We'll be here until a new Pope is chosen - no matter how long that takes. Donate to support our effort to bring you up-to-the-minute developments. https://bit.ly/42ZFWU0\n\n#conclave #pope #live"

But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive. \n\nExplore Vice City and beyond at https://www.rockstargames.com/VI\n\nThis trailer was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5, comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes.\n\nSong: Hot Together\nArtist: The Pointer Sisters\nWritten by Sharon Robinson\nPublished by Universal Music Corp. on behalf of itself, Buchu Music and Robinhill Music (ASCAP)\nCourtesy of RCA Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment"

            "description": "\"I wanted fans to all come to this special first pop up Old Phone pub gig to all be there for the same reason, and emotionally connected. I wanted everyone in that room to have felt the same feelings of nostalgia, longing, joy and sadness I had felt from going through my old phone. I asked all of them to submit a video, a photo or a message from their old phone that meant a lot to them to get into the gig that night, and we all shared in a night of music, dancing, laughing and tears. It was really magical, maybe my favourite music video I’ve ever made.

I wanted everyone in that room to have felt the same feelings of nostalgia, longing, joy and sadness I had felt from going through my old phone. I asked all of them to submit a video, a photo or a message from their old phone that meant a lot to them to get into the gig that night, and we all shared in a night of music, dancing, laughing and tears. It was really magical, maybe my favourite music video I’ve ever made. Shout out to Emil Nava for making my dream happen, all the amazing people who built the Old Phone pub for one night only in Ipswich MA, and of course, all the wonderful people of Ipswich MA who made us feel so welcome that day.

Smith and Jack De Sena (aka Chris & Jack). We've been friends for years and love making high-quality, high-concept sketch comedy. Chris is an occasional Blue Man in Blue Man Group. As a voice actor, Jack played Sokka in Avatar the Last Airbender and Callum in the Dragon Prince. In 2016 we united to create this channel, confusingly titled “Chris & Jack”, which has served as a shared platform to write, produce, direct, edit, and star in our own stuff. We're releasing comedic sketches of all shapes and sizes. Sci-Fi, Heists, animation, movie tropes, fantasy, absurdist bits, and plenty of fun new experiments. But above all else, friendship.  \n\nA huge thank you to all our Patrons, including our \"Producer Tier\" friends:\nDJ Smu-Mu\nSteve Mould\n\nWe love you!\n\nCheck out all our stuff: https://chrisandjack.komi.io/\n-Merchandise: https://www.pixelempire.com/collections/chris-and-jack\n-Our podcast: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjHQDpOQYcsbahkI2yAmxjw\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisandjacksketch (Chris) https://www.instagram.com/chrissmithwho (Jack) https://www.instagram.com/jackdesena\n-Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisandjackarechrisandjack\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/chris_and_jack\n-Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisAndJack/\n-Discord: https://discord.gg/sBVGdmg  \n\nCAST:\n\nDetective - Chris W.

            "description": "P1Harmony (피원하모니) - ‘DUH!’ MV\n\n[Apple Music] : https://music.apple.com/kr/album/duh-ep/1811491701\n[Melon] : https://www.melon.com/album/detail.htm?albumId=11798745\n[Spotify] : https://open.spotify.com/album/31Q4mSPAjzNEwqSwyBzW5p\n\n매 앨범 커리어 하이를 기록하며 놀라운 성장세를 보여 주는 그룹 P1Harmony(피원하모니)가 5월 8일 여덟 번째 미니 앨범 ‘DUH!’로 돌아왔다. \n\n전작에서 HERO가 느끼는 슬픔과 공허함, 영웅의 이면을 조명하며 극복의 힘을 노래했던 피원하모니는 새 앨범을 통해 영웅의 또 다른 면모를 보여 준다. 미니 8집 ‘DUH!’는 자신들을 필요로 하지 않는 사람들에게 “이렇게 멋있는 우리가 필요 없다고?”라고 반문하며 파업을 선언한 영웅, 피원하모니의 모습을 그린다. HERO는 언제나 정의롭다는 고정 관념을 깨고 하고 싶은 대로 행동하는 피원하모니의 모습을 위트 있게 풀어낸다. \n\n동명의 타이틀곡은 이번 앨범이 담고 있는 이야기를 관통한다. ‘DUH!’는 빈티지한 비트가 주는 레트로한 매력과 피원하모니의 트렌디한 보컬이 어우러진 곡이다. 특히 제목인 ‘DUH!’는 ‘이 잘나가는 사람이 누구야? 당연히 나지! 뭘 그런 걸 물어!’의 뉘앙스를 가진 영어 표현으로, HERO인 나 자신을 조금 더 과시하고 이 상황을 당연하게 받아들이는 모습을 재치 있게 표현했다. 정의롭고 겸손한 기존의 HERO와는 다르게, ‘내가 앉는 자리, 내가 걸어가는 길이 답’이라는 내용으로 남다른 존재감을 나타낸다.\n\n퍼포먼스는 프리스타일 댄스에 중점을 두며, 기존의 퍼포먼스보다 더 새롭고 힙한 느낌을 가미했다. 후렴구의 ‘DUH!’ 포인트 안무는 인탁이 아이디어를 내어 제작되었다. 또한 소울이 마지막 후렴 부분 안무에 직접 참여하며 피원하모니의 색깔을 확실하게 부각시킨다. 특히 ‘DUH!’ 퍼포먼스는 같은 동작도 멤버마다 다른 느낌으로 볼 수 있다는 재미가 있으며, 멤버 각각의 개성이 도드라지는 프리스타일 댄스를 즐길 수 있다는 점이 포인트로 작용한다. \n\nP1Harmony, a group that continues to break own records with every release, is back with 8th Mini Album “DUH!” on May 8th. \n\nIn previous album, P1Harmony explored the loneliness and emptiness felt by a HERO, shedding light on the hidden struggles behind heroism and unveiling yet another side of the HERO. The 8th Mini Album, 'DUH!' introduces a HERO who refuses to be taken for granted, boldly asking, “You really don’t need us?” and going on strike in response. It flips the idea that heroes must always be noble, instead portraying a bold, free-spirited side of P1Harmony with a playful twist.\n\nThe title track 'DUH!', which shares its name with the album, embodies the album's core message. Built on a vintage beat with a retro-inspired groove, the song merges old-school charm with P1Harmony’s trendsetting vocal style. The title track 'DUH!' is an expression conveying the attitude of \"Who’s the big shot here? Of course, it’s me! Isn’t that obvious?\" and playfully showcases a more self-assured and bold version of the HERO. Unlike the traditional HERO, who is righteous and humble, this HERO asserts an undeniable presence with lines like \"Where I sit, and the path I walk is the answer.\"\n\nThe performance emphasizes freestyle dance, bringing fresh and hip vibes compared to previous routines. The key move of 'DUH!' was created by INTAK, while SOUL contributed to the choreography in the final chorus, further highlighting P1Harmony’s distinctive style. One of the performance’s highlights of 'DUH!' is how each member interprets the same movements in own unique way, making a dynamic and individualistic freestyle expression.\n\n▷OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL X : https://x.com/P1H_official\n▷OFFICIAL MEMBERS X : https://x.com/P1H_members\n▷OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official\n▷OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony\n▷OFFICIAL TIKTOK : https://www.tiktok.com/@p1harmony\n▷OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #피원하모니 #P1H #DUH",
