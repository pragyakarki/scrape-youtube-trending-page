Hungry for the worldliness she is lacking, Bella runs off with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a slick and debauched lawyer, on a whirlwind adventure across the continents. Free from the prejudices of her times, Bella grows steadfast in her purpose to stand for equality and liberation.\n\nCast: Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, Jerrod Carmichael Christopher Abbott\n\nSubscribe To Searchlight Pictures: https://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures\n\nConnect with Poor Things Online\nFollow Poor Things on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/poorthingsfilm/\nLike Poor Things on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/PoorThingsFilm\nFollow Poor Things on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/PoorThingsFilm\n\n#PoorThingsFilm #Searchlight \n\nConnect with Searchlight Online\nVisit the Searchlight WEBSITE: https://www.searchlightpictures.com/\nLike Searchlight on FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/searchlightpics\nFollow Searchlight on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/searchlightpics\n\nPoor Things | Official Trailer | Searchlight Pictures\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/searchlightpictures"

            "description": "Jimmy Butler has really shined in the postseason, leading Nick Wright to tell Colin Cowherd that underestimating him and the Miami Heat in these NBA Playoffs has been a serious mistake. He points to Butler's stats, and explains why he's one of the top postseason players in the league. Plus, rumors are swirling that LeBron James is being recruited to the Dallas Mavericks by none other than Kyrie Irving, and in response, the Los Angeles Lakers released a statement that they have no intention of bringing on Kyrie to their roster... Nick and Colin share their thoughts on this report, and Nick tells Colin why he believes both players will remain right where they are.\n\n#TheHerd #NBA #MiamiHeat\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb \n \n►Watch the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/LatestOnTheHerd \n\n▶The Carton Show's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED \n►Speak’s YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from THE HERD: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFoxSports \nLike THE HERD on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFacebook \nFollow THE HERD on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDTwitter \nFollow THE HERD on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDInstagram \n\nFollow Colin Cowherd on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ColinCowherdTwitter \n \nAbout The Herd with Colin Cowherd:\nThe Herd with Colin Cowherd is a three-hour sports television and radio show on FS1 and iHeartRadio.

                "description": "Jimmy Butler has really shined in the postseason, leading Nick Wright to tell Colin Cowherd that underestimating him and the Miami Heat in these NBA Playoffs has been a serious mistake. He points to Butler's stats, and explains why he's one of the top postseason players in the league. Plus, rumors are swirling that LeBron James is being recruited to the Dallas Mavericks by none other than Kyrie Irving, and in response, the Los Angeles Lakers released a statement that they have no intention of bringing on Kyrie to their roster... Nick and Colin share their thoughts on this report, and Nick tells Colin why he believes both players will remain right where they are.\n\n#TheHerd #NBA #MiamiHeat\n\nDownload the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb \n \n►Watch the latest content from The Herd: http://foxs.pt/LatestOnTheHerd \n\n▶The Carton Show's YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SubscribeCartonShow\n▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST\n►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED \n►Speak’s YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBEtoSpeak\n►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE \n►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY\n►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow\n►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube channel: http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube\n\nSee more from THE HERD: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFoxSports \nLike THE HERD on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDFacebook \nFollow THE HERD on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDTwitter \nFollow THE HERD on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/THEHERDInstagram \n\nFollow Colin Cowherd on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ColinCowherdTwitter \n \nAbout The Herd with Colin Cowherd:\nThe Herd with Colin Cowherd is a three-hour sports television and radio show on FS1 and iHeartRadio.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of Hanssen's death and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\r\n\r\nHe had been serving a sentence of life in prison without parole after pleading guilty to 15 counts of espionage and other charges in 2001.\r\n\r\nFull story: https://www.9news.com/article/news/nation-world/robert-hanssen-fbi-agent-russian-spy-dies-in-colorado-prison/507-32eccb9f-5020-4db5-bc28-53ea80bd9332\r\n\r\nMore local videos here: https://bit.ly/2Pa0d1l  \r\nSubscribe to NEXT: http://bit.ly/2eP1GwI  \r\nStay connected: 9NEWS Website: http://www.9news.com/  \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ilike9news  \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/9NEWS  \r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/9newsdenver/  \r\n \r\nDownload the 9NEWS App: https://www.9news.com/appredirect/  \r\nSign up for the 9NEWSLETTER: https://www.9news.com/email  \r\n \r\n9NEWS (KUSA) is located in Denver, Colorado.",

Hosted by 18-time major champion Jack Nicklaus, it is one of the PGA TOUR’s longest-running events at the same venue, having debuted at Muirfield Village in 1976. Billy Horschel returns this week to defend his title from 2022. His four-stroke victory marked his seventh PGA TOUR win last time out. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler also heads to Muirfield Village after finishing tied for third in last week’s Charles Schwab Challenge. He finished just one stroke outside of the Emiliano Grillo and Adam Schenk playoff. Grillo and Schenk will also be competing this week, looking to bring their hot hands to the Memorial Tournament. FedExCup Standings leader Jon Rahm and world No. 3 Rory McIlroy will also be teeing it up at Muirfield Village. Rahm won the tournament in 2020 by three strokes. Two-time tournament champion Patrick Cantlay heads back to Ohio aiming to get a third win under his belt, and his close friend Xander Schauffele will aim to grab his first title here after four top-20 finishes in five starts at the Memorial Tournament.

With our never-ending renovations, improvements and gardening we've been doing this spring, we've decided to give our tired and sore backs some help by tag-teaming in a legend in the world of gardening: THE TRACTOR! A 2012 Kubota B26, bright orange tractor with 1800 hours on it to be precise 🤠 That's right, through a twist of fate and a bit of good fortune, we were able to get one recently and it's beautiful. And we need YOUR help in naming it! Please comment your names below! 👇 But first we have to learn how to drive it, use the bucket, backhoe and forklift. This thing turns on a dime, lifts giant payloads with ease, and is generally so much fun to drive that maybe we're going to become the TractorWives?! Okay maybe not just yet, but we're in love with this tractor. Maybe we can even start a new landscaping side-hustle: C&J's Landscaping! Has a nice ring to it, eh? No more walking on sharp rocks, breaking our backs lifting for hours a day. The backhoe mode is kind of the opposite of the lifter mode, and after some trial and error, we were able to plant our first cedar tree with it. For anyone who's never operated a tractor before, it's almost like playing a video game like Smash Brothers, where your button inputs suddenly become backwards. We're so happy! We also checked in on our little seedlings in our green house and are so excited to show you how much they've grown already 🌞 And we're finally creating a pathway for our fruit garden. We can't wait to see what new projects we can complete with our new tractor friend.

How did we get here?\nIn the winter of 2019 we moved in to our self built van full time to begin living, working and travelling Canada.

We drove our van thousands of miles through various countries-Canada, USA, Mexico & Guatemala. All of which we documented here on our channel, be sure to check that out! After many years on the open road we found ourselves 15 acres of remote woods on the East Coast of Canada where we are building a homestead and renovating our fully off the grid cabin. We are diving into this chapter of our lives in no experience, we're so happy we can bring you all along as we learn to do it all with our own two hands.
