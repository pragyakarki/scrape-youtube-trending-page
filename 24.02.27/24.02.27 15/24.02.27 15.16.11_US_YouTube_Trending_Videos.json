            "description": "This Summer the American Saga begins. Horizon: An American Saga - Only in Theaters June 28 #Horizonamericansaga\n\nAcademy Award-winning visionary filmmaker Kevin Costner directs New Line Cinema’s vast “Horizon: An American Saga” Chapters One and Two, a multi-faceted chronicle covering the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West.  A story of America too big for one film, this true\ncinematic event also stars Costner, who co-writes with Jon Baird (“The Explorers Guild”) and produces through his Territory Pictures.  \n\nIn the great tradition of Warner Bros. Pictures’ iconic Westerns, “Horizon: An American Saga” explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won—and lost—through the blood, sweat and tears of many.  Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner’s ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.  \n\nCostner stars alongside an impressive ensemble cast that includes Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Owen Crow Shoe, Tatanka Means, Ella Hunt, Tim Guinee, Danny Huston, Colin Cunningham, Scott Haze, Tom Payne, Abbey Lee, Michael Rooker, Will Patton, Georgia MacPhail, Douglas Smith, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Alejandro Edda, Wasé Winyan Chief, Michael Anganaro, Angus Macfadyen, Jon Beavers, Alex Nibley, Kathleen Quinlan, Etienne Kellici, Amos Jason Charging Cloud, Bodhi Okuma Linton, Gregory Cruz, James Russo, Jeff Fahey, David O’Hara, Chris Conner, Leroy M. Silva, Bernardo Velasco, Tom Everett, Glynn Turman, Giovanni Ribisi and more.\n\nCostner returns to directing for the first time since his 2003 critically acclaimed hit “Open Range,” and revisits Civil War-era America, the setting for his 1990 blockbuster and directorial debut, “Dances with Wolves,” which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.  He produces alongside Howard Kaplan and Mark Gillard, with Danny Peykoff, Robert Scannell, Armyan Bernstein, Charlie Lyons, Barry Berg and Rod Lake executive producing.\n\nCostner is joined behind the camera by director of photography J. Michael Muro (“Billionaire Boys Club,” “Parker”), production designer Derek R. Hill (“Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” “The Magnificent Seven”), editor Miklos Wright (“For All Mankind,” “Open Range”) and costume designer Lisa Lovaas (“Ambulance,” “Transformers: The Last Knight”).  The music is by Oscar nominee John Debney (“The Passion of the Christ,” “The Greatest Showman”).\n\nA New Line Cinema presentation of a Territory Pictures production, “Horizon: An American Saga” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.  The films will be released in theaters nationwide, the first on June 28, 2024, the second on August 16, 2024.",

            "description": "In my giant cloud rainforest vivarium (Pantdora), I attempted the dangerous task of setting up the stage for two adult praying mantises to breed, in hopes to secure a future generation of praying mantis babies for Pantdora's rainforest ecosystem. The entire mantis courtship process was a nail-biting journey with a result I didn't expect. But after it all, I ended up with the biggest crisis in the history of Pantdora.

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  \n\nWe’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nOur home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.

            "title": "Why Widespread Tech Layoffs Keep Happening Despite A Strong U.S. Economy",
            "description": "The tech sector is having a big 2024. Nvidia just crushed earnings expectations. The AI boom remains in full swing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is up more than 8 percent year-to-date.\n\nThe U.S. economy is also doing surprisingly well, adding 353,000 jobs in January, well ahead of economists' forecasts. Hotter-than-expected inflation data may also keep the Fed from cutting rates as soon as the market expects, a sign that the economy remains strong enough to support higher interest rates for longer.It's a different story for tech workers, though.\n\n\"The layoffs to the start of 2024 signal a dramatic shift in the tech industry,\" said Jeff Shulman, professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business. \"We're going to continue to see layoffs happen as the future of work has changed, as the future of technology has changed, and as investors appetite for risk and growth versus profitability has dramatically changed as well.\"\n\nThe number of tech sector layoffs in 2024 has been outpacing the number of terminations in 2023. So far, about 42,324 tech employees were let go in 2024, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks layoffs in the tech industry. That averages out to more than 780 layoffs each day in 2024. In 2023, nearly 263,000 tech employees got laid off, averaging about 720 firings each day that year.\n\nThere are several factors behind the churn. Artificial intelligence is at the forefront.

                "description": "The tech sector is having a big 2024. Nvidia just crushed earnings expectations. The AI boom remains in full swing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is up more than 8 percent year-to-date.\n\nThe U.S. economy is also doing surprisingly well, adding 353,000 jobs in January, well ahead of economists' forecasts. Hotter-than-expected inflation data may also keep the Fed from cutting rates as soon as the market expects, a sign that the economy remains strong enough to support higher interest rates for longer.It's a different story for tech workers, though.\n\n\"The layoffs to the start of 2024 signal a dramatic shift in the tech industry,\" said Jeff Shulman, professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business. \"We're going to continue to see layoffs happen as the future of work has changed, as the future of technology has changed, and as investors appetite for risk and growth versus profitability has dramatically changed as well.\"\n\nThe number of tech sector layoffs in 2024 has been outpacing the number of terminations in 2023. So far, about 42,324 tech employees were let go in 2024, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks layoffs in the tech industry. That averages out to more than 780 layoffs each day in 2024. In 2023, nearly 263,000 tech employees got laid off, averaging about 720 firings each day that year.\n\nThere are several factors behind the churn. Artificial intelligence is at the forefront. Companies need to free up cash to invest in the chips and servers that power the AI models behind these new technologies. There's also the stock market effect.

            "description": "Bobby Carter | February 21, 2024\nMotivation has always been the leading message of Jeezy's career and he's never veered off the path. The Atlanta superstar stayed consistent with his Tiny Desk, focusing on the early chapters of his career and creating a story arc in between songs. \"I was able to connect with my people and my culture because we spoke the same language,\" he explained before playing \"Go Crazy.\" \"I wanted to inspire and give people the blueprint, people who wanted more for themselves.\"\n\nJay \"Jeezy\" Jenkins' music could easily be taken at face value given the number of hits he's racked up over his two-decade career, but he made his target audience and intention clear through the titles of his Thug Motivation albums. He's taken his mission far beyond music, excelling as an investor and more recently an author. His memoir, Adversity for Sale: Ya Gotta Believe, made it to the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nThe Snowman enlisted Tiny Desk vet and bassist D. Hodge to assemble a band to breathe new life into selections from his catalog. The string section brought opulence to these gritty street anthems and features two familiar faces: viola player Lelia-Michelle Walker and NPR's own Ashley Pointer on violin. Jeezy dedicated \"Everythang\" from TM:103 Hustlerz Ambition to Pointer and showed plenty of love to the group of Howard University students in the crowd.

You can choose to follow the main storyline and find the source of the evil blight that plagues the land, or set off on your own to explore strange locations and develop your character based on their actions throughout the game. Featuring stunning 3D graphics, open-ended gameplay, and an incredible level of detail and interactivity, Morrowind offers a gameplay experience like no other. Now of course we could follow the plan the developers had and beat or we could do something different. In Their divine wisdom they gave the players of Morrowind the most overpowered spell imaginable and said that they could have it from as early as level 1. So how on earth can a player beat morrowind with only necromancy a skill which is exceedingly limited and has few overpowered gameplay features. You can take a level 1 character and turn them into the most powerful character in the entirety of the elder scrolls universe.

            "description": "Directed by Eli Roth, Borderlands is based on the video games created by Gearbox Software and published by 2K. The film stars Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Edgar Ramírez, Ariana Greenblatt, Florian Munteanu, Gina Gershon, and Jamie Lee Curtis. \n\nThe full trailer for the Borderlands movie debuts online on Wednesday, February 21, 2024.\n\nLilith (Blanchett), an infamous treasure hunter with a mysterious past, reluctantly returns to her home planet of Pandora to find the missing daughter of Atlas (Ramírez), the universe’s most powerful S.O.B. She forms an unexpected alliance with a ragtag team of misfits – Roland (Hart), once a highly respected soldier, but now desperate for redemption; Tiny Tina (Greenblatt), a feral pre-teen demolitionist; Krieg (Munteanu), Tina’s musclebound, rhetorically challenged protector; Tannis (Curtis), the scientist who’s seen it all; and Claptrap (Black), a persistently wiseass robot. \n\nThese unlikely heroes must battle alien monsters and dangerous bandits to find and protect the missing girl, who may hold the key to unimaginable power. The fate of the universe could be in their hands – but they’ll be fighting for something more: each other. \n\nLionsgate presents, in association with Media Capital Technologies, an Arad / Picturestart production, a Gearbox Studios / 2K production. Lionsgate will release Borderlands in the US and UK on August 9, 2024.\n\n#IGN #Borderlands #2024 #FanFest #BorderlandsMovie",
